Welsh Assembly's own "like mape"
Several assemblies are working hard to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for this fear is to change the name of the Assembler to propose to the Weash Parliament.
Assemblies of various political groups are threatening to face the revolution by focusing on the change.
A team member of a lab said, his group is concerned that "Twp and Pwp are at peace with the new term"
For readers outside Welsh: in Welsh, Twp means dumb and Pwp means soft.
One Played Assembly member said that as a group, they are "not happy" and suggested options.
A member of Welsh Konzervetiv's party said that the group sees the change of name as "open mind" but notes that the difference between MWP and size is limited.
This means, like the expression of the English U.S. English of Weish Burn Dblu.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently implementing a decree for the change process, says: "The final decision of the members of the Assembly will certainly be taken by members."
The Governor of Wells Act 2017 grants Welsh Assembly the right to change their name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a population where the proposal to replace the Assembly with the Welsh Parliament is widely supported.
Regarding the membership of the Assembly, the Commission supports the Welsh Parliamentary Member or WMP, but MWP has received the highest support in science.
Apparently, assembling members are recommending different options, but it will be difficult to reach the same level for the pre-trial officer, Elin Jones, who will have to collect the pieces of the order within a few weeks.
This reform bill will include changes to the procedures of the Assembly, including the inability of the members and the design of the committee.
After the debate on this bill, the Assemblies will be given the opportunity to vote on what their names should be.
Macedonians are voting in a vote to change the country's name
To change their country's name, the voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether to change the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was arranged to avoid the decades-long dispute between neighboring Greece, whose country is Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that its neighbor's name is a symbol of the establishment of demands on their territory, and therefore the European Union and NATO have repeatedly responded to members' requests.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who opposed the vote on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
Although supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Jaev, believe that the name change is only a step needed to join the European Union and NATO.
Harlem's churches are still smokin', and St. Martin's fruit is a quiet hour.
"The old people I spoke to said that historically each corner had a church and a pansala," said Mr. Adams.
"There's none of this today."
He said that he understood the need to get out of the hospital.
It is now "in different forms of human social communication".
"Pants are no longer home to live in the area where everyone goes on a regular basis."
For the Church, he is concerned that the money he sells will not continue as long as the leaders think, "And today and tomorrow, they will return to where they started."
He also said that it is possible to build an apartment building and a condominium instead of the church where all those who will not help the rest of the local worshipers will live.
"Most of those who buy Condominium in these buildings will be Santa Claus," he said, "and that's why they're pushing for the day of the closing of these churches because most people who come to the Condominium are likely to be members of the church."
Harlem was established by the Church of Shetang before becoming a farm-based university – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and after a decade of it.
The Mul Shetang Methodist Congregation left the church in 1930.
A cultivator takes the property of the building in the vicinity of the house of worship.
Under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, a farming community takes over Saint Martins, who is looking for a boycott in the Fift Street, which is one of the main ways for the Harlem Canacat.
The building was badly damaged in a fire accident in 1939, but the Parisians of the Father's Population planned to restore it, and they planned to build the carilon.
Rav. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson, and heir to St. Martin's, proudly nicknamed Carolon "the hour of the poor."
The expert who played it last July called it "a historical resource" and "absolute historical utility."
Tifani Niang, a specialist at the University of Michigan, adds that it is the world's largest carilon in the vicinity of a farmer's world, which was designed to play a larger carilon in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Marywood said Saint Martins did not replace him.
What happened in Saint Martin's last few months is a serious incident by the landlords and the lawyers, who are appointed by the church's general leaders or by the Episcopal Dioceses.
Vestry – the governor of Paris, who was formed with the general leaders – expressed their concern in July that they thought that Diocese would transfer the "costs" of the Diocese, even though it was not related to the administration of the Diocese.
Some members of Paris complained about the lack of transparency in the work of Diocese.
A 13 - year - old girl in California was attacked by Hungary after drowning in a ring
The officials reported that a 13-year-old boy was injured in the attack of Hungary after the first day of the World Cup.
The attack took place near Ensinitas at Bikens Beach seven mornings ago.
Chad Hamel San Diego told KSWB TV that he was able to hear the child’s cry for help on Saturday morning with his friends and to help him to get out of the water with a group of people.
Hamel says, first he thought that the boy was snoring to catch a yellow lion, but then "you can understand that the boy said, 'He gave me a kiss'!"
"He has made me sick!"
Hamel says he's getting to see the boy.
"I hesitated to get out of the water for everyone, saying, 'There's a hunger in the water!'
The boy is sent to a hospital where he is in serious condition.
The people of Hungary were not known to attack.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Jails reports in Briefing that a hag was seen in the area a few weeks ago, but it was not found to be a dangerous population.
Jails adds that the victim has suffered a serious stroke in the upper arm.
Officials from the Ponto Beach of Casablanca banned access to the coast of Ensinitas to the coast for 48 hours in research and security.
Jails reported that there are more than 135 Hungarians in the area, most of which are not dangerous.
Ensbury is planning to enter the United Kingdom market.
Sensbury Boots, Superdrag and Debenhams continue to compete in the retail business of the Department Store.
As part of a major attempt to access the United Kingdom Billion Pounds, these large waves will be launched in the country’s 11th store and will be successfully launched in the other shops, where the United Kingdom’s fashion market is growing where the necessary equipment market is placed in fashion and home.
This investment is in circulation because supermarkets are looking for a new way to fill the shells with TV, microwaves and household furniture.
Sensberis said it would double the amount of its visual features into 300 times, which will be the first time the revolution, IJ, Tizerman and Doctor.
There will be more widespread ranges, such as Laurel, Mabelin and Barts, which will include brands such as boots.
The supermarket is starting its boutique makeup range so that most of the money becomes Vigan Friendly – which has become very popular among young Croatians.
In addition, the perfume seller will test the distribution of supplies from the French shop, which was launched last week in the South London chain, and the second part of the next year will be the market in Birmingham.
On-line kanakat and local Moudi are trying to increase supermarkets for the Croatian community.
Mike Coup, Chief of Ensbury, said that outlets should look like a department store because the Supermarket chain is competing with a store like Aldi and Lidl, and there will be more services and no food.
The company claims that Argos outlet has been operating in the first century since the purchase of Argos and Habitats Chains two years ago and that it has opened up some of the Habitats that have increased the sale of Mudi's goods and made it more profitable to take over.
The operation of the supermarket and the company sector has failed before.
A joint project with the first Fike Boots in the first decade of Ensbury 2000 was tested, but the project ended because of the dispute about how the winnings will benefit from the company's supermarkets.
Ensbury is continuing this new technique after selling its 281 business to the owner of the company Lyeds Farms.
The company reported that by adding a billaholic range of the Skincare brand, Lloyds will play a role in the project, including La Rosse Poze and Vishi in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hex, the commercial manager of Sensbury, says: "We have changed our wings to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained workers who will be present for advice.
Our brand ranges have been designed to meet all the needs and we have now become a dependable model that will challenge the old ways of kanakater because of the attractive environment and the convenient location."
Peter Jones 'Fireshama', recalling Holly Willoby 11 million pounds.
In order to focus on the new deal with Hollywood Marx and Spencer and with ITV, Dragons Dan's star Peter Jones's lifestyle brand has to cancel the deal with Peter Jones's firesman.
There's no time for their home materials and reference brand Truley.
Gineth Paltro's gop brand is compared to the business of this pair.
This morning representative, 37, reported on his departure from Instagram.
The Hollywood Dragons Dane has angered Peter Jones, the star of Peter from their attractive lifestyle brand business, with the aim of focusing on his new bomb deal with Marx and Spencer and ITV.
The source says that Jones Rague went "fire" when a meeting at his commercial empire in Bakinghamshire on Tuesday's march, the TV girl admitted that she had no time for his new deal – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – for their home items and accessories brand trolls.
The business was compared to Gineth Paltro's Goop brand and expected to double the resources of the 11 million pounds in Wilobir.
Willoby, 37, after reporting his departure from Truly in Instagram, Jones left Britain on the jet plane for his holiday home.
One source says: "Truli was so far at the top of the list of lead oil.
It was part of his long-term future plan that would meet his financial needs for the next few decades.
Her decision to return was completely surprising to all concerned.
No one could believe the events that took place on Tuesday, the project was to be launched very soon.
There's a good stuff on Marlo's passport that's made for sale."
Experts believe that Deas Morning, who is now one of the most reliable stars in Britain, may have lost millions of pounds because they have already started out with furniture, clothing and household items, and the potential delay in its recovery will be added to the damage.
And that could leave a long day's friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to the cape for a decade.
Willoby started a trouli with Cap in 2016 and joined Jones as president in March 52.
Jones has 40 percent share in the TV application company of Katan and Baldwin.
Willoby Mandas will be Brand Ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the representative of the I.I.M. Celibacy Event.
A close source from Jones last night says, "We won't comment on his business Lenden."
A complex discussion 'and then we'll fall in love'
He laughs at the positive attitude of North Korea's leader and after making a comment that some people will think of as "a-President."
Why did President Trump leave so much?
Trump spoke in the voice of his mechanic "the news representative".
"I didn't give up."
He said that he was interested in seeing Kim the second time in June following their first meeting in Singapore, and that the Tromp called for a major step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the dialogue on nuclear disarmament is over.
After more than three months of the Singapore conference, North Korea's top Communist Rei Yong Ho on Saturday's general session told the world leaders that North Korea's pre-deployment measures do not see a "related reaction" in the United States.
Although, he says, the ban on U.S. pressure is being imposed.
The tromp expressed a more positive view when speaking to her in Ellie.
"We're in a good position with North Korea," he says.
"We faced a war with North Korea.
Ten million people could be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He claims that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim led to positive results – which ended the rocket tests, helped free the prisoners and bring the remaining American workers back to the country.
And she supported the unusual stand to talk about her relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to act as president, but this famous Arina stood outside 10,000 people standing here, instead of trying to get in here, only 200 people," the Tromp pointed out with his finger for the society that was right in front of him.
In Indonesia, Sunami and the earthquake killed hundreds of people who were devastated, hundreds of people
After the Lombk earthquake, for example, foreign government agencies were told that they did not need help.
Although more than 10 percent of people in Lombque were displaced, no national disaster was announced, a precedent for receiving international aid.
"In some cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international cooperation, so it is challenging," Mrs. Sambang said.
Although a group is meeting to go to Save The Children, it is still uncertain whether foreign workers can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, head of the National Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation of Elul in order to determine whether foreign organisations will be able to participate immediately.
In the face of Indonesia's regular earthquake, the country is not prepared to face this type of anger.
Although the Sunami asylum centre has been built, it is the same as the one in other coastal areas.
Despite the state of alert, there is a clear lack of good warning in Palu, perhaps life after death.
Many islands in Indonesia are challenging when the time is very good.
Natural disaster communications have been further challenged.
At least three days before the new disaster, the ship will be able to escape a ship set up by Lomb, but it will take at least three days to reach the new place.
President Joko Widodo has put the urgent development of Indonesia's infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and has invested in the construction of roads and railways.
But before the re-election of the next year, Mr. Jokor's government has been arrested by the government.
Mr. Joko feels pressured by the long-term contemporary excitement in Indonesia, where Muslim leaders have taken more conservative lifestyles in their religion.
In a fight between Christians and Muslims, more than 1,000 people are killed and more than ten thousand people are homeless, killing two groups on the streets with their hands, arms, and other protective weapons.

The police have invited the public in the area to inform them of anything they see or hear.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says: 'The sentence is at an early stage, but I'm asking anyone around John Barkenhead's Street who sees or hears a question.
I am asking everyone, especially the taxi drivers, who may have any feet on the desk, to contact us because they may have urgent information for our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman Barkenhead was found inside a house and her body.
Friends in the evening, who think this woman is familiar with them, asked where the woman's body was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have reported that they are trying to inform women's relatives.
When a taxi driver in the Grayson Museum tried to enter his flat, the police told him that no one was allowed to enter the building or get out of the building.
He gets upset when he hears about the incident.
The residents of the building are told that it will take more hours to enter them.
A police officer has been told to tell a man that the entire area is being held as a crime scene.
There's a woman at the scene.
He said, "The paper is very sad."

The new victim of the "historic re-record" of the Cromwell of Parliament
His religious shortsighted followers will be able to remove this image after the destruction of many of England's cultural and religious views.
But the Cromwell Society has announced Mr. Creek's advice as "instinction" and "historic rewriting efforts".
Chromwell Society's president, John Goldsmith, said: "It was possible that the image of Oliver Chromwell, located outside the Westminster Palace, would become a symbol of the current separation of the image.
The execution of the iconoclastism or demonstration destruction of the English household during the war is not edited by the Kromowell command or by him.
In the previous century, his earlier tomas was to dissipate the image of the wrong chromewall.
Sir William Hamo Thornicrofft's amazing image of the 19th century's opinion and a historical character that many people consider to be worthy of celebration.
The Sunde Telegraph says Mr. Goldsmith: "Many people consider Chromwell to be the protector of the Parliaments in the face of external pressure, in his case, against the pressure of the kingdom – which has now been accepted by less people by the 19th century.
But it's part of the ongoing historical debate that's a completely correct picture of the time.
Which is certain, the 17th-century conflict has shaped our nation's next development and Cromwell is a well-known character who represented one of the sides of this division.
It is worth celebrating and remembering as the Lord's project."
Killed by a black Chinese farmer
According to local news reports, a black farmer was attacked in a South-West China market.
The people, who were only identified as "Euan", have been reported in a report from the South China-Guyjo-Pansui post on Sunday South Kianna Morning post in the southern Chinese province of Guijo.
On May 30, 2005, China's Kinghai Shiining is preparing to pay for sugar at a sugar farm in China.
He was told to come to the market with his cousin from nearby Greece on Wednesday to sell 15 zeros.
The next morning, his cousin drank him dead and saw that a door to the side door was open.
He said there was a big man with blood on his face.
A forensic examination confirms that the 5050 pounds weight has been attacked by the farmer, the report reports.
"My uncle's feet were bleeding and injured," says Fupato, who was identified as "U" as his son, quoted Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera's foot appears to enter the market to feed its teeth in 4 to 40 minutes on Thursday.
His body was found about an hour later.
The guy who killed the guy is not his brother or his cousin.
A manager of the market told Evining News that the police are collecting airtight on the scene and that the chest has been detained so it can't attack anyone else.
Yohan's family and market authorities are discussing how much damage to his death.
Although poor, there has been an attack on people of the poor.
In 2016, a woman in Massachusetts attacked her husband and her husband with a severe attack on their food so that they were seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound-weighted Xan Welsh farmer put pressure on his tractor until his wife came and scared the shark.
After a farmer in Oregon had eaten his stomach in 2012, a farmer told CBC News on Monday that pigs are not generally aggressive but can act as "trigger or exciting" for blood taste.
"They're just doing bad things.
They're small, very interesting animals, but they don't try to hurt anyone.
But you have to go with them enough," he says.

Bret Cavana's audience saw more than 20 million people.
Cristin Blazi Ford, a prominent Bret Cavana of the Supreme Court and accused of sexual assault, which took place in the 1980s, saw more than 20 million viewers on the six-year-old television network.
On the other hand, political opposition continues, for the beauty of Friday's last moment, the broadcasters have suspended a regular event: an agreement made by Senator Jeff Flek of Arizona, which will be given a week to investigate the FBI's complaint.
He told the Ford Senate Jewish committee that he was 100% sure that he would hand over his body while drinking at a high school party and try to open his clothes.
Cavana says in a sensitive statement that she is convinced that the event did not happen in the same century.
It is possible that Nielsen's report saw this program of more than 20.4 million people watching Friday.
The company calculated the average of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, fax news channels and MSNBC viewers.
Other networks, which have been broadcast, were not available with viewers, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fax Business Networks.
And Nilsen usually faces problems with the quality of the viewers sitting in the office.
The number of players in the program was equal to Play Of or Academy Wards.
Fox News Channel, which says that the event’s representatives strongly supported the Cavan’s idea, has attracted the largest audience of all networks, with an average of 5.69 million, Nielsen, all these days.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
According to CBS 3.1 million, NBC 2.44 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.22 million, Nielsen reported.
After the hearing, there was a lot of interest.
Flake was in the center of the show today.
After giving his statement, the Republican office of the Middle Republic held CNN and CBS in the Chamber on Friday morning, when he went to the elevator to reach the hearing of the Jewish committee and the protesters shouted for him.
He stood down for a few minutes in front of the protestors, who broadcasted CNN directly.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think Cavana is telling the truth to the country?
He's told, "You have power when many women are in need."
Flake says his office gave a statement and said before the elevator was closed, that he had something else to say in the committee's hearing.
Later, when the Jewish committee voted in favour of the entire Senate's nomination, cable and transmission networks were broadcast directly.
But Flek says he will vote in this condition that the FBI will investigate charges against a elected person who was asked by the low-ranking democrats next week.
His conversation with the Democratic Senator Chris Kun was affected in part by the fact that Flake was elected.
After speaking to Kun, Flek spoke to several other senators and reached his decision.
Flake's decision was due, because the Republicans had a clear vote to approve the cavana except for the investigation.
The president has launched an FBI investigation on the basis of a complaint against Trump Cavanar.
British Prime Minister May complains about the Brixit of Controversies 'Police Game'
In an interview with the Sunde Times magazine, Prime Minister Teresa May of the European Union complained about the future of British critics of his plan to leave the European Union for "political game" and to ignore the nature of the nation.
On September 29, 2018, Britain's Prime Minister Teresa May attended the Konzervetive Party Conference in Burmingham.
On the first page of the paper, another interview with his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson Brexit continued his review of the so-called Chequer's plan for May, saying that Britain and the European Union are "fullly unjust" to collect each other's kingdom.
Wade Sims Shotting: Police suspect Daton Simpson was arrested at the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect for killing LSU's 20-year-old basketball player Wade Sims.
20-year-old Daton Simpson was arrested in prison for murdering a second degree, Baton Rouz police department said.
The authorities posted a video of the disagreement between Sims and Simps and the police reported that he was missing during the time of Sims Maramari.
Simpson's DN has been found in Simpson's DN, a co-founded WAFB report from the police station.
After jeering Simpson, the police have admitted to killing Wade.
According to the Advocket report, he has set a total of $3500,000.
An initial report by the Office of the Research Officer of the East Batton Rouge area was published on Friday to indicate the risk of shooting at the head and throat as a cause of death.
The department is grateful for the assistance of the Luiziana State Police Flights Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and the locals to help investigate the population of Asamian.
LSU's athletic director, Jo Aleva, thanked the law enforcement agency for its "Professor of Trials and the Establishment of Justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
This six-foot-high foreword baton was raised in Rue, where her father played basketball with Wayne and LSU.
He scored 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last year.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade says that the group is "suffering" and "suffering" at the death of Wade.
"It's a matter of concern for all time," Wade says.
Firefighting in Mexico City
Vosm excitement from Popocatepalt Agneugiri has reached the southern part of the capital of Mexico.
The increase in the presence of firefighters' mouth and the amount of gas and moisture in the 183th scale, when it reaches the national disaster centre, alerts Mexican citizens to stay away from the fire department on Saturday.
The center was monitoring several gurgles and tears.
Photo from social media shows that in areas such as Jochimilco, Mexico City, the vehicle’s windows are empty.
A 7.1 earthquake that struck Mexico between geologists in September 2017 marked an increase in the presence of firearms, which is only 45 miles (72 km) south of the capital.
The gas pipeline known as Don Goo has been active since 1994.
In front of the freedom vote calendar, a police conflict with the Catalan disbanders
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday when they joined the opposition protests for the first year of the vote, focusing on the freedom of the Catalan Republic.
A group of cross-sectional disunity policemen beat eggs for them in the face of banning them, and shed color powder on the street, creating black clouds that are usually filled with the tourist community.
The next day, Maramario gets laid, using the police to stop.
Protesters in the slogan "I won't forget, I won't forgive" for a few hours, they met the only supporters who said "Span's long-lived".
14 people take treatment for minor attacks because of protests, local news reports.
Since the announcement of the October 1st referendum by the secluded Catalans, Madrid Bayni has been a source of excitement in the area of freedom.
The majority of voters vote for independence, although the number of voters was low because most of the population was opposed to divorce.
According to the information provided by the Catalan authorities, the ban on voting time across the region last year has resulted in the deaths of nearly 100 people in a fatal conflict with the police.
The freemen were on the street all Friday night to prevent the national police from showing themselves.
Protesters continue their activities but are forced to go to different streets.
68-year-old Narcissus Termis, who is a well-known activist who is involved in the protests with his wife, says he is not ambitious about the freedom of Catalonia.
"Last year was one of the best times of our lives.
I've seen my father come water in my mother's eyes to vote, but now we're trapped," he says.
Despite the important but severe victory in the presidential elections last December, the Catalan freedom groups have fought to maintain their course, where many of their well-known leaders are waiting for freedom to be released or for trial in the declaration of independence.
A 42-year-old mechanic Joan Pig, who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, said that the politicians on both sides had created this opposition.
He adds, "Days are getting tougher."
On Saturday, not in the pre-trailer prison, one of the Catalan leaders announced last year that he would participate in the European Parliament election next year.
He says, "The best way to stop the opposition of democratic values from the Spanish government is to stand up to the European election."
London: Man's arrest after the car crash.
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years of age, were arrested in a London house repeatedly by the vehicle.
The event took place in Balinagard Criscent in Bangladesh on Thursday in the 1930s.
Deputy Inspector Bob Blemings said that the gates and the buildings were damaged.
At some point, the car may be sightseeing and shooting.
Mengar's ball wins the livers' 1-0 stake in Livingston.
The first round of the Dolly Mengar won in Livingston.
Stephen Jarard, a master of the Ibrax Club, gave a second victory in the 18th.
The Dolly Manger's throat was blocked as Gary Holt's team joined the Hibernians in second rounds.
As a result, Gerard's team left the championship without winning any odds, and they will face the hearts that are at the top on Sundays, which are eight points higher than they are.
Earlier on Thursday, the European League of Rangers will honor the Epid Viennese.
Livingston, the race for their independence in the division has already grown in six games, but the main Koch Holt, who came to Kenya last month, has not yet been able to enjoy the victory.
Livingston misses a number of chances against their indiscriminate opponent.
Many years ago, they were to move on to the Holt group because their aggressive attitude had created all kinds of problems for the Rangers!
Scott Robinson's defense is broken but failed to carry out his efforts, then Alan Lithgo can only run his effort on the Wide after he has been able to match the Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts had to play the Rangers in front of them, knowing that the guests could be in trouble.
And that's the big deal.
Rangers consided a free-circuit and opened the livingston rounds, gathered to set up Declan Gallagher and Robinson Manga, who rolled from the center of a tache box.
During this time, Rangers had authority, but they knew the defence of the guests as a disgrace, and it has been used for most of the time by the cyclist Lyam Kali.
This order continued for the second time, even though Alfredo Morlos was holding a shot at Kelly.
Scott Pittman was taken to the foot of Alan McGregor, Rangers' roundabout, and another set of pizzas was obtained from Lithgo Wade for Livingston.
Crossings came in the Livingston box and would continue to be clear, although two panels were required - the option Glen Middleton was charged after the Challenge of the Halet and Handball.
'Unbelievable 'Karti Livingston's analysis
Alsdair Lament Tony McKarney, from the BBC Scotland
Livingston is a great performance and performance.
To someone, they were miserable, they continued to lose all hope in their own superior speed.
After returning to the top, their game type and players have changed very little, but thanks go to Holt for the way he united the group.
He had a lot of grandkids.
Captain Halcket was amazing, created a corruptly organised defense, and kept Manga Cone's goldson and Joe Warell always in silence.
Even though the rangers were less inspired.
That's what they've been good at under Gerard.
Their final ball was missing - only once they opened the welcome - and this is a warning to Rangers, who are now in the middle of the table.
In Erdogan Colon, we found a mixed environment.
On Saturday (September 29th), Turkish and German leaders were very happy to meet for Brexit in Berlin.
This is the last day of the German trip to President Erdogan's debate - which is aimed at re-establishing relations between NATO partners.
They debate the issues of human rights, freedom of the press and participation in Turkey.
After Erdogan, he travels to Cologne to reinvigorate a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police have protected 250,000 people from joining the mosque, but many supporters have come to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters who opposed Erdogan - many of whom were Kurdish - heard their voices in Erdogan's policy and their decision to welcome him to Germany.
This protest proves that a viewer is praised by German Turks as a hero and condemned by others as a ruler.

Long Lartin Prisoner: Six officers were injured in the earthquake.
Six prime officers were injured in a high-security prison, the Privy Office responded.
On Sunday morning, at 9 a.m., HMP Long Lartin in Orchester spreads and is running.
There are eight prisoners in one branch, with experts from "Tronedo" in the face of the riot.
Officials have been examined for verbal attacks on the scene.
A spokesperson for a Prime Minister said: "A specially trained prison worker in the HMP Long Lartin has been nominated for an event.
Six members of the staff were examined for slaughter.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be subject to the law and they will spend longer time behind the prison."
HMP Long Lartin has 5 percent of the country's dangerous criminals
It was reported in June that the prison administrator went to the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, there was a major riot in the Red Officers' prison where the police were attacked.
Hariken Roza Phoenix, Las Vegas, Saltlake City is threatening the tropical floods.
The crisis in the Arezona of the Lower Crescent of Greece may have occurred, but the very first week of the week, it seems that it will happen when Hariken Roza, across the South-West continent, will be able to cope with its remaining forces with the dangers of the tropical rain.
The National Weather Commissioner has already posted the Flash Fleet Watch in the cities of Western Arizona and East Nevada, South-East California, Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Saltlake City.
It is hoped that the rain will reach the end of Monday, right over the Phoenix.
A tweet by the National Weather Commissioner of Phoenix stated that only "the Ten Diseases have remained in the Greek World Storm or Underworld since 1950, between 200 miles [20 km] of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was one of 40 miles from the Jed border."
The latest National Hariken Center model has predicted the rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, which may be up to 6 inches in the Arizona Meadows Rim.
With central Rockies and Great Basin, the other regions of the South-West Mediterranean have the potential of a total of 1 to 2 inches of rain, which can be up to 4 inches apart.
Rains can be a blessing for people who are at risk because the areas are devastated
Although the rain is of great concern, some of this rain may be of benefit to the south-west.
According to U.S. government survey, more than 40 percent of Arizona’s population is suffering from excessive spending, which has been reported as the second highest category.
First, Hariken Roza will land along the Baja California Islands of Mexico.
Rosa, who is still a powerful Haricen, is moving to a maximum of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, from Mexico’s Punta eugenia to a total of 385 miles per hour north of 12 miles per hour.
The storm is strengthening the face of cold water in the peaceful ocean.
So, on Monday or in the evening, it's expected that Mexico will land in a tropical storm.
Mexico's share of heavy rains can pose a significant risk.
"From Baja California, the North-West Sonora has the potential for raining up to 10 inches."
Rosa will then travel north to Mexico as a Christmas subspecies before arriving at Arizona in the morning and will enter the southern Utah on Monday night.
"The main threat from the end of the day is the Baja California, the North West Sonora and the South West Pacific," according to the National Hariken Center.
As a result of this rain, tropical rains and devastating torrents can flow to the horizon and land in the wilderness.
The attack on Midsama's North: four attempted murder arrests.
A three-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested for trying to kill a 16-year-old girl who was injured by a gunshot wound.
In the area of Teres, in the northern part of the Midsamar area, the boy was injured by about 4 in September.
He was taken to a hospital where he's now "stabilized".
A 17-year-old, two-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested in the Edstok area, Avan and the Soviet police reported:
Officers have asked to move on to those who can have mobile phones.
Tromp says the Kavana Democratic Party was called 'disloyal, angry'
"Tramp said at a meeting in West Virginia, "a vote for the judge's cabinet to reject the démocratic party's trifle and angry strategy, "
Trup says that Kavana has been described as a 'dishonest, angry' of the Democratic Party.
Kavanh witnessed in front of Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denied the charge of Christian Blacie Ford that he had been sexually assaulted a few decades earlier in his childhood.
Ford also testified to his complaint.
President Saturday said "American people saw the extraordinaryness and qualities and courage of Kavanhar that day."
To the supporters of Western Virginia, he said that a vote would be a vote to protect a lawyer with a public Sterling record for Jaz Kavanh, the most successful individual of our time."
During the mid-term elections, the president explicitly acknowledged the importance of the Republican vote.
"Only five weeks away from the most important election of our life.
Although I don't take part, I really do take part," he said.
"That's why I'm always trying to fight for poor applicants."
Tromp argued that the demonstrators are in the "resistance and banning" campaign.
It is not expected that the Senate's first presidential vote on the Cavan's nomination will be held on Friday, a former member of the JOP's leadership told CNN.
In Indonesia's earthquake, hundreds of deaths in tsunamis, toll increases are being witnessed.
The authorities said on Saturday that at the time of a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulaosi, at least 384 people were killed on the coast of the Great Sea.
A few thousand people were gathered to a festival on the seashore on Friday in Palu City when six meters (18 feet) high in the evening fell into the sky, which drove many people to their death and destroyed everything on the road."
Sunami comes after a 7.5 earthquake.
"Even at the time of the tsunami threat yesterday, people continued their activities on the seashore and those who could not run immediately and became victims of it," said Sotopo Puro in a briefing in Nugroho Jakarta by the Indonesian disaster relief agency BNPB.
"Sunami didn't come from itself, it took the car, the log, the house, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho added, "Sunami traveled 800 kilometres an hour (477 miles) before it hit the sea.
Some people rose up from Shunammite and they survived,
Some 16,700 people have been moved to the center of 24 dollars.
The photos of the crash agency's publication of the sky show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, the gates have been turned upside down and broken and a mosque has been sunk into water.
Offerers continue to dive in the suburban city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt by 2.4 million people in the affected area.
In a statement by the Indonesian Agency for the Assembling and Application (BPPT), the power released by the Great Earthquakes on Friday was nearly 200 properties in the Hiroshima World War II.
The location of the city, which is at the end of a long, fresh sea, can increase the size of the Sunami
Nogroho describes the damage as "back" saying that a few thousand homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels are broken down.
He said that there are 540 people who have been injured and 29 who have been missing."
Nogroho reported that the disaster and damage could be even greater in a region near Dangala, near the centre of the mainland, along a distance of 300 kilometers (90 miles) north of Palu.
The communication said "was complete without any information," Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, "Red Cross has made a statement, and added that workers and volunteers are going to the affected area."
"It's already a tragedy, but it can be worse."
The agency was severely criticized for not giving this information to Sunami Palu, although officials said that there was noise when the alerts came.
A person on the bottom of the building on the social media shared with the person on the bottom of the foothills has come to hear a warning earlier by Sonami on the street.
In a few minutes, a steam current in the water is driven by the pressure and the building and the car.
Reuters was unable to verify the footer immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunamis cause a power fluctuation that separates communications around Elul and makes it difficult to rescue the authorities.
With the help of the military, Jakarta and other cities, the Kargo Plan has launched, the authorities have announced that the rescuers now need food and other essentials.
The city airport has only been restarted for rescue efforts and will be closed to normal until October.
President Joko Widodoor was about to visit Palu's shelters on Sunday.
In Indonesia, the number of deaths in Sonami has risen to over 800.
It's very scary.
According to Mr. Dosser's speech, when the World Organisation's activists went safely from Dungla to Palu, where the workers were sheltered from their office, they saw a picture of destruction on the road.
Dosebah also says, "They've seen many homes destroyed there."
It's a pity.
Even when relief teams were about to begin disaster relief, there were also some who complained that with a lot of skills, foreign aid workers were being prevented from travelling.
According to the Indonesian authorities, it is from abroad that poor supplies and workers can come only when the site is declared a national disaster area.
But it hasn't been announced yet.
Aulia Aryani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross, said, "It's still a country crisis."
"If the government says yes, it's a national disaster" we can start international aid, but there's still no announcement.
On Friday, the second night of the attack of Sunami in Pulu, friends and family of the homeless are looking forward to a miraculous event that will bring them to the end of a natural disaster chapter.
A little boy is taken from the nordma on Saturday.

Mr. Mendaghi also points out that those who were arrested at Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
He also said, "I have my own feelings as an advance in paragliding."
Mr. Jendon recalled how soon after the news of Roa Roa Hotel’s collapse spread to the paragliding community, he went back and spread it through the Watsap message to the competitions who took part in a festival on the seashore.
It was hard to find her message, though it was not her message.
He said, "He didn't send the message."

Cain West: This apper has changed his name to Yes.
R Apper Kein West is changing his name.
In his announcement on this change, he wrote on Saturday on Twitter: "The officially known Keen West."
The West, 41, was also known for some time and used the name as his property.
His presence in the Night Live on T-Satard was revealed earlier, where he hoped to discover his new album Yandy.
The event is being replaced by a singer, Ariana Grande, who canceled the event "for emotional reasons".
The West had previously said that the word was religious, in addition to the short form of his current professional name.
When discussing the title of album with the radio operator Big Age early in the West, he said, "I believe that 'yes' is the most used word of the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'.
"I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
Kein says that the only person who means it reflects our good, bad, our confusion, everything.
This album reflects our identity more."
He's one of several famous apparers who changed their names.
Sion Combs is known as Pope Daddy, P.D., or D.D., but this year he announces profit and brotherly love.
A former partner in the West worked with J-J, and Hyfen, Hyfen, and the capital.
Mexico's M.M.L. has also sworn not to use military forces against ordinary citizens.
Mexico's elected president Andres Manuel Lopez has sworn on the 50th anniversary of the bloodthirsty attack against forced citizens.
Lopez Abrador at Tolateloko Plaza on Saturday promised that "no military force will be used for the persecution of Mexicans."
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired peaceful protests that killed 300 people while the left-wing student movement in Latin America was building a strong position.
Lopez Abrado, a young Mexican, apologized for her monthly education and helped to build up another government university.
He said that the lack of opportunities for unemployment and education attracts young people to the crime scene.
The United States should give doubles in human intelligence.
As China has become more active in human intelligence, U.S.A. and should double the amount of research costs in this area, says the German intellectual researcher and investor Kai-fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This statement came from various parts of the government, in the United States, which announced that the United States has an official creative strategy.
China has already launched its new plan last year: to achieve 1 place in creative intelligence in 2030.
Lee adds, "The double budget will be a good start in the research of artificial intelligence where most countries are far behind and we are looking for next steps to progress in artificial intelligence."
This week, Lee said in an interview with the NBC.
Lee, whose book "All Superwars: "China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" is a month-long investment by Houston Mifflin Harcourt, head of the Sinovavance Vancer, China's other top-level charity agency Facebook+.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Melon worked on a creative intelligence system that defeated the top-ranking American player and was chaired by Microsoft Research and the Chinese branch of Google.
The previous U.S. government technology competition, like the Agency's ROBTix Challenges, has acknowledged the latest actions.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"The Chinese academic leaders are not moving away; the corporations are leaving," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology organizations have appointed the lighthouses from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee says that changes in the immigration policy can help to increase the EU's efforts in the US.
"I think the Green Card should be automatically sacrificed to HDD in the understanding of the Green Card," he said, adding that the AI's efforts have increased.
In July 2017, the State Council of China launched its next generation's creative intelligence development plan.
People from the National Natural Science Foundation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, such as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies, provide finance to US researchers, but there is little academic value in work, says Lee.
In the beginning of this year, the U.S. Defence Department has set up a joint German research centre, which means involving artists and scholars, and the election committee on White House Creativity.
And this month DRA announced a $2 billion investment initiative called AI Next.
As an NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million in research on artificial intelligence every year.
Meanwhile, the U.S. law did not advance in a few months to try to establish a National Security Commission on Crescent Intelligence.
Macedonians vote on whether to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a vote on whether to hold "Republic of North Macedonia", a step that would resolve the ten-year-old dispute with Greece that prevented the European Union and NATO from seeking membership.
Greece, where there is a region called Macedonia, represents a requirement of its northern neighbour and advocates the entry of NATO and the European Union.
On the basis of the new name proposed by the two governments in June, the anti-nationalists believe that this change will undermine the national identity of the majority of the people of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the vote and suspected that the Turn Out would have to fill at least 50 percent of the required vote in order to be allowed to vote in the cast.
The question at the poll was: "You agree with Greece and are for members of the European Union."
Supporters for the renaming of Prime Minister Zoran Jaev have argued that the European Union and NATO are the most important countries in Macedonia.
"I have come to vote for young people in Macedonia today for the future of the country so that they can live independently in the sixties of the European Union because it means a safe life for all of us," 79-year-old Olivera Georgesko said in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they will follow the outcome of the vote by making decisions.
The parliament needs two-thirds majority to rename.
The Royal Elections Commission said 1 Nagad won't find any news about Unyaim in the afternoon.
However, compared to 34% of the 2016 National Parliament elections, only 16% of registered voters voted 66%.
"I came to vote for my children, we have seats in Europe," said José Tenevski, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Jaev, his wife Jorica and his son Dushko voted in favour of the country's vote to change the name of the country, which will open the way for joining NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkv was preparing a small stage and was taking the chair to set up the polls.
"We're in favour of NATO and the European Union, but we're not at the door of service, we want to join our heads up," Kavadarkev said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can go to others like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asia setting."
Prime Minister Jaev said that NATO members will make the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that there will be a large majority because more than 80 percent of us are citizens of the European Union and of the NATO," Jaev said after he graduated.
He said that a "yes" would be the result of our "confirmation of the future."
The Macedonian Institute for Police Research said in a survey published last Monday that 30 to 43 percent of the votes required for Turn Out will be cast.
Another challenge, run by Telma TV in Macedonia, is planning to vote on Sunday by 57% of respondents.
70 percent said they would vote.
More than 50 percent of the votes must be voted to make the vote successful.
Since the adoption of power in May last year, the failure to vote will represent the first deadly attack in Western law.
See: Enter the entire Breton defense for Sargio Aguiero, Manchester City.
The history of Manchester in England's Manchester Stadium in Saturday, Manchester City, between two and two years ago, the British defences of Sargio Aguero and Rome Sterling.
Aguiero made his score more easy in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the incident, an Argentine striker was taken to Midfield.
Before going to open ground, he ran between three Briton Defenders.
Aguiero was then surrounded by four green Jerseys.
He turned one of the Defenders before he left on the edge of the Bryton Box.
Then he pushed a step to the left to find the sterling.
The English foreword uses his first touch to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right boot to defeat the British protector Matthew Ryan and hit the right side of Jaal.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems at his feet," the City Manager told reporters Pep Gardiola.
"We talked about his game for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he had a bullet in that moment."
But Starlingi gave Sky Blaze the primary advantage of the struggle of the Premier League.
That bullet came in 29 minutes.
Aguiero found the bottom of the Briton area in the game.
He sent the ball to Liraya on the left side with a nice route.
Sterling took a few bags before moving to the remote post.
The Sky Blues just before leaving the border, they just tapped it.
At 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday, the Cinsim Rein-Neker-Arenna of Germany will fight Hophenheim in the Cite Champions League group.
Sharer Spoiler's last name in Rocky's game
After removing the nationals from the playoff debate, there was no reason to force anyone else to start.
However, he expects to vote against Colorado Rocky on Sunday, but only if the L.A.L.L.D. has the influence of winning the one-game leader for Rocky.
On Friday night, Rakis won 5-2 for the Nationals, but they still want to get their first division title.
"If we don't play for anything, at least we can walk on the rabbi to know that Dad and the other group are likely to face me this year at the highest level of any point.
Why don't I want to compete in it?"
Nationals have not yet been able to announce a start for Sunday, but it has been said that the surgeon can poke in such a situation.

A Tromp Meeting in West Virginia
During the mid-term election, the president strongly highlighted the situation surrounding Bret Cavana, who was elected by his Supreme Court.
"We are in danger of what we have done in November.
Five weeks from the most important election in our life.
It's a big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm really running, because I've been all over the place to fight bad applicants," he said.
Tromp continued, "You see this fearful, fearful Adial Group of Democrats, you're seeing it happening now.
And they're strong enough to use any means they need to regain power, you see this low, high quality.
They're hurting people, they're going after them for power and control, they're not giving anything, they just want power and control, we won't give it to them."
He said the demonstrators are in the "resistance and prevention" campaign.
"And you've seen that for the last four days," he says, "democratics are called "angry and low and powerful and unfaithful."
He called on Senator Diane Finnstein of the Senate’s Democratic Senate Justice Committee, who received high-level tweets from the viewers.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you lost the game?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, no, I'm waiting - it was really bad Buddy Languez – the worst Buddy Languez I've ever seen."
Leber is no longer a free organization.
Those who think they're not being tolerated here.
When the members of the Momentum in my area blamed me for voting, it was not surprising.
'Cause I was the last lab on the list to tell you that you're not going to welcome the nature of your heart.
My fellow parliamentarian Joan Ryan was treated in the same way because he stood firm against Jewish conflict.
In my case, I was blamed for having a bickering with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, Europe and national security, and similar issues, which Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
On Friday, Nettingham East Labar Meeting said that "we want to make meetings inclusive and productive."
In my eight years as a local lab MP, it was just like GC meeting this first Friday night.
Sadly, however, today, it is not the Sunday of the meeting and the promise of a "gentle, mild" politics has been forgotten for a long time, if it has ever really begun.
It has been increasingly apparent that there are no differences in the lab party and that it is acceptable for group leadership to decide whether it is acceptable.
After Jeremy was the leader, I began to think with my colleagues that I had the same political views they were expecting me to take the Internet and take a position that I would not have decided at any time - whether it's national security or the U.S. market.
Whenever I speak in public – and even if I don't get anything to say – there is a call for me to be removed through social communication, a ban on the politics of the centre, and I'm told that I shouldn't be at my lab party.
And it's not just my own experience.
In fact, I know that I am more successful than some of my colleagues, because the comments I have made are also political.
I was surprised to see all the colleagues who were facing a violent and racial violence on the basis of sex every day.
The most disappointing side of this political era is howgalaly's lack of freedom has become normal
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the lab party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a free organisation, and the change of the "unlawful" voting or election rules narrows the group.
For the past two years, I've been advised by a lot of people to keep my head down, not so busy and I'm going to be right.
But I didn't come into politics to do this.
When I joined Leber 32 years ago as a school student, we were raised by the neglect of the Thayer government, which literally destroyed the categories of our extensive school, I tried to provide the necessary government services – whether as a local council or as a government minister.
I never hid my politics with the last election.
No one in the Ntingham East was in any way confused about my policy position and the areas of conflict with the current leadership.
For those who preached this Friday, I will only say that when the country moves towards a brexit that will damage families, business institutions and our citizens, I cannot understand the desire to abuse my time and power by showing loyalty to the leader of the Leber Party.
But I really don't have a message for Nettingham Momentum, whether it's a member of the lobby or not: I'm proud of your service, and I promise that no threats of cruelty or political urgency will prevent me from saying the best nature for all of you that I believe.
Chris Lesley Nettingham, an MP.
Iris 38-17 Melrose: Rise at the head of uninhabited iris
In time, two attempts could reduce the gap between the final results, but there is no doubt that this day’s extraordinary entertainment talent was worth winning.
They are now at the top of the table, the only invincible group in ten.
Finally, it was their best defense, it was just as good as the ability to take the opportunity, which helped the welcome party to win, and it was the right reason to be happy with Coch Peter Morchi.
"We've been tested in every game so far, and we're still invincible, so I have to be happy."
Robin Kristy of Melrose said: "The air must be credited, they have made better use of their possibilities than we have."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt to turn the ice into ice by the French climate, but a yellow card from Scotland's player Ruy Hughes, which evicted him for the game by Wariers, enlisted Melrose and attempted a failure.
At the Klimo Panel, the iron lead increased, just prior to it, at the time of the Haftime, it became 17-5 in a single effort to stop.
But Melrose began a good start, and Patrick Anderson's attempt to be transformed into five points of space by the bagot
Then, for a long time for the serious injury of the Ruyard Nott, the game was closed, which became a striker, and when the game began again, the weather continued much further through the efforts of Stifford McDoval, which turned Klimo.
Iron-borne Prime Minister Blue McFarson then got a yellow card, and at the end of one of the deadly pressure levels, added an additional player to the Bruce Calvin's attempt to iron at Melrosez.
Although the welcome r is coming right back, and when Struan Haschinson sees Klimo without saying it, the panel line goes off the McFarson line and goes down to the water base without saying it.
Again Klimo converts, Kyle Roo, when David Armstrong's box was bluffed and Flander Henry sent out to the fifth attempt on the home side.

The 56-year-old star plays on Jack Jarvis, who himself wrote and co-wined with the funny friend Greg Hamfil for a long time.
Both announced that the upcoming November series will be the last series of shows, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craigland.
According to the list of official records, he's the owner of the adrephtured limit
The actor refused to comment on this, although the Scottish Sun source indicated that Kiernan Glasgoi wants to be associated with "rich restaurants" in the business.
'The sea is ours': earthly Bolivia hopes the court will open the way again to the Pacific
Nabikara La Paz is setting up a Rigging Clad Naval office.
Public buildings are flying a huge blue flag.
The ships from Lake Titaka are decorated by the main minister: "Our rights in the sea"
It is a duty to recover ""
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of Haran subculum is still clear to Chile in the battle of a 20th-century blood resource – a chance to travel once again to the Pacific Ocean.
These expectations are likely to be the highest in a few decades, because after five years of discussion in Bolivia, the International Court of Justice has waited for October 1st.
"Bolivia has that speed, unity and natural awareness, and of course we expect results with positive views," said Bolivia's Communist Roberto Calzadila.
Many of the Bolivian Ice Ages will see the big screen across the country, they are hopeful to meet the demands of the Hague Tribune of Bolivia - after a few decades of appropriate discussion - Chile is obliged to discuss a sovereign outlet on the sea.
Ivo Morales, the Bolivian Carishmatic President - who will face a controversial fight for election next year - also relies on the Monday ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is not possible to decide for Bolivia - and if so, it will only change slightly.
The organization of the United Nations based in the Netherlands does not have the ability to land on Chile and has stated that they will not determine the outcome of the discussion.
The final argument that the ICJ's ruling came after hearing only six months indicates that the case was "not valid," said Chilean International Law Special Page in Jeret.
And the reason for Bolivia could continue in the last four years, rather than taking the cause of Bolivia.
"The current Bolivian administration has raised the issue of access to the sea," Jerette said.
He said that the conversation against the war in Morals highlighted Chile's warm welcome.
Bolivia and Chile may continue to talk for a while, but it will be very difficult to discuss afterwards.
The two countries have not traded since 1962.
The representative of Bolivia in The Hague, former President Edwardo Rudrigez Veltzi, denied that the decision was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia's "A Wonderful New Age Opportunity for Chile" and "Residence of 139 Years of Interference with Personal Benefits" will bring you an opportunity."
Kalzadila also denied that Morales - still the most popular president in Latin America - Meritaim is using the Isuti as a political quest.
"Bolivia will never leave access to the Pacific," he added.
"It's a chance to see that we're going to have to cut off the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not come to the US unless it believes.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ree Yong Ho said his nation would not first disarm nuclear weapons if Washington could not believe it.
He made this statement at the United Nations General Session on Saturday.
He called on the United States to comply with the promise of a summit in Singapore for rival leaders.
His comments came when US Foreign Minister Mike Pompey of North Korea, Kim Jong, with him, appeared to be on the way to relaunch the nuclear war in Singapore more than three months later.
Rei says it's a "pipe dream" that continues the bans and threatens North Korea's opposition to the Korean War.
Washington warned that Pyongyang could agree with the announcement without the first significant disarmament process.
Kim and the U.S. president of Donald Trump wanted a second convention.
However, there is considerable doubt that Pyongyang is the only way to leave an astrologer, which the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompe wants to travel next month for the preparation of the second Kim-Tramp meeting.
Paris fashion shows publish the last line of huge headware on a high street near you
If you want to increase your top collection or block the sun completely, you don't need to see it.
The designers Valentino and Thom Brown Ranway have launched a series of Oversized Head Gears for their SS19 collections, which gave the Paris fashion week a style set.
In this crisis, the most unwarranted topi instagram has fallen, and these designers have sent their eyeballs to Katwa.
Valentino was the only creature that was a top-deck top top top top that was decorated with a wide band that covered the models' heads.
Among other overcrowded links is a huge turbulence, including a wizard's top and an anarchy - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browno also published a selection of creative mosaics – and at just the right time for Halloween.
Many colourful faces were like Hanibal's electrician, who was like a very nice and funny guy.
A creature with snorkel and Googles is similar to the whole school dipping gier, another looks like a snorkeled icecream.
And if you go on with the big fashion statement, you're lucky.
Style watchers predict that large bonnets can reach you on the high street.
The Outsied Tops compete with 'La Bomba', a two-foot, wide-banded top that was seen from Ryana to Emily Nightzkovski.
The Kalt label has created another big one behind the very unnecessary top of the social media that has been spread - a street bis bag, which is much like the style of a silk shirt model.
The Paris Fashion Wyke La Riverer's SS19-pocketed Rafia Bag, with Rafia Fringing and a white leather handle at the top, was different.
Celebrity Stylist Luke Armitage Company said: 'I hope that the big towel and street bags will come to the high street in the coming winter - since the designers have had such a big impact, the needs of overcrowded relatives will be difficult to ignore.'
John Edward: Language skills are needed for the world’s citizens
The free schools in Scotland have left a track record of academic excellence, and it has continued to produce an even more unparalleled test in 2018, which only reinforces the efforts of the public and private.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independents (SCIs) try to provide their students and parents with the best possible level of service.
Individual schools aim to prepare for their seats as their students, their chosen professions and the world's citizens for more and more education.
As an educational area that can design and apply text programs at a particular school, we see modern languages continue as popular and favorite subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela says, "If you speak to someone in a language that he understands, it's in his head.
If you speak to him in your own language, he'll get to his heart."
It is a powerful demonstration that we cannot rely only on English if we want to establish relationships and faith with people from other countries.
As a result of this year's recent test, we see that the language is at the top of the league tables with the highest pass in the single school.
A total of 68 percent of foreign language students received a higher grade.
According to data collected from the 74 CSI students, 72 percent of the students in Mandarin received higher grades when 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students received this.
It proves that Scotland's single schools support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will surely need in the future.
The language is now, as a matter of preference, the single school curriculum and other STM issues (scientific, technological, engineering and calculation).
A 2014 survey by the EU Commission for Employment and Scales found that officials have caused 17 percent of their language to lose their ability to fight in the face of unemployment.
More and more, language skills are needed to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are needed in the world to enable more people to work.
Anyone who chooses a career, if they learn a second language, they will have the real benefit of gaining their lifelong skills in the future.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign people automatically presupposes a multilingual person.
According to Ugov, more than 4,000 young people in 2013 failed to speak well in any foreign language at the time of the conversation, and the French language was the only ten-year-old language, 15 percent.
This is why it is important for today's children to invest in language learning.
A number of languages, especially the languages of the developing economy, will provide a better opportunity for children to search for a meaningful workplace.
In Scotland, each school will be divided into their learning languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will appear to be the most important language for the eucalyptus, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what the interest of your children, there will always be many languages to choose from in private schools, with specialized training workers.
Sketch single schools are required to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the necessary skills to succeed whatever the future may require.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied at this moment that languages play an important role for the future of the country, so it should certainly be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Single schools will provide this preference, diversity and encouragement for Scotland's young people.
You must do this.
John Edward is the manager of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Lebron will show himself in San Diego on Sunday.
Lebron James's first trip to Los Angeles Lakes is almost over.

However, the number of minutes to play is not yet set.
"It's going to be less than one and less than 48," Walton says on Lakers' official website.
Lekars' reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James would probably play a minute.
After this week's training, James was asked about his plans for the six-game Precise Timer of Lakers.
"I don't need a prize game to be prepared for this stage of my career," he said.
The time of Ellie's West Virginia, the YouTube channel
President Donald Trump, Western Virginia, took a storm to the campaign meeting tonight.
This was the first of five Tifsil meetings a week after the match with the tennis and Mississippi.
The Supreme Court's vote to fill in the vote is calling for a confirmation of its election, the purpose of which is to support the mid-term election, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress after the vote in November.
What is the time for the West Virginia convention tonight, and how do you view it online?
Tromp's Huiling, West Virginia's meeting is scheduled for 7th night, this evening, Saturday, 29 September, 2018.
You can see the Western Virginia event below, using YouTube live stream.
Tramp will probably talk about the hearing of the candidate Bret Cavanar, elected by the Supreme Court this week, which has emerged as a result of the allegations of sexual abuse by an expected senator during the FBI investigation.
However, the first goal of these meetings was to help the Republics achieve some speed in the face of the November election.
In this way, President Trump's campaign said that next week, five of them were aimed at "strengthening volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their membership under the Senate and representatives," Reuters reported.
"Congratulation control is so important to his agent that, while we enter the campaign as much as possible, the president will travel to the realm," said a campaign leader in the magazine of the unwelcome troupe.
Today's meeting for Wesbenco Arena in Huiling can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and bring cover from Pittsburgh's media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Since last week, Tromp West Virginia has traveled the second time this week, with more than 40 percent of the points he won in 2016.
In front of the Tromp election, West Virginia is trying to help Patrick Morrisik, a candidate of the Republican Senate, who is behind in July.
According to Reuters, politicians at West Virginia University, Simon Heder said, "It is not very good for Morris to see the president try to encourage him in the election,"
Rider Cap 2018: Team USA shows the hunger for fighting to keep the hope of a single Sunday.
At the end of the three-unit session, the bike forsam was needed for this rider's hat.
Momentum Pendulum is a completely creative idea of playing, but players really believe in it, and most of all in this national competition.
So where do they say Momentam now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I think we have a few moments now," Jordan Spith said to go for that day.
Europe has the opportunity, of course, to move on at four points to the remaining 12 games.
As Spith said, Americans think they have some help on their way, and they can be encouraged by many, especially by the Spith and Justin Tomas who have played together every day, and they have taken three out of four.
Spyth was fatal from the beginning to the end and was leading from the beginning.
With his rounds running, he was stronger when he and Thomas were behind two points, as if to take the entire four-point square match off.
The same kind of shout as the match won them on the 15th floor, which tells you so much that he believes that the American team is not outside.
"You really have to go deep and think about your match," Spit said.
That's all of these players now.
18 to mark one.
In the last two days, the player has found more points than either Speth and Thomas, but only Francisco millery and Tommy Fleetwood, the injustice of the Rider hat.
It's strange in Europe, but it can't be four or anything wrong.
Molywood was the only couple who didn't shoot a bug on Saturday, but they were avoiding it on Saturday morning, Friday and Friday morning.
The race, and their strength, seemed to have seen this passionate crowd and flown out of the sky, that they were the players to win the Sundays, and that there are no more popular players to win the European victory, except for the fleet or millinary.
It's good if they both are in different positions at the same time.
Even though European pride has been on the rise for a long time.
Bobba Watson and Web Sympson had some problems when Alex Norren was in contact with the Forebol Nayak Sergio Garsia in the morning.
In the first nine, a bogie and two double Spaniards and Swedes were thrown into a cave where they could never get up.
On Sundays, though, there's no one to get you out of your cage.
Between the two sides, the opposite lies, which they suggest, are very attractive from the Forebol and Forsam, which can be changed in a short time.
Europe has been a long-awaited team and has taken an important lead on the final day, but this forum has further proved that the team is hungry for the fight, which was suspected by the U.S.A., especially the stateside.
Europe's 10-6 led on the final day of the radar cap.
In the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe will benefit from a 10-6-hour strike against the U.S. force from the Forebol and Forsam match.
The enthusiastic couple Tomi Fleetwood and Francisco millinary have now taken their plates to four points against Tiger Woods twice in the Gulf National.
The European team in Tomas Jørn, two years ago in Hazeltin, was fighting for the recovery of the lost traffic, and the series won 3-1 in the morning's forum.
America offers more resistance to the two matches, but they can't fill the gap.
It takes eight points from a 12-day match to restore the trophies.
The Tana Four-Point Fleet is the first European Rocky and he and millinary, together, only the second pair of the four-point-after-weeks in the history of the Ridera Cup.
Woods and Patrick Reed were thrown to the fore, and then the lost Woods and the American Rucky Brison DeKambiu were forced to defeat more severely by 5 and 4.
On Saturday, two of the matches took off, but now she has lost 19th and 7th March between her forebell and foream.
Justin Rose, taking a break for the morning forum, returned to Henry Stanson, the partner of Forsam, Dustin Johnson, and Brooks Kooper, 2 and 1 – one and three numbers in the world.
A favorite to the south-west of Paris, even though it was not Europe's own on the day of the wind.
The three-time winner Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans on Saturday.
They won 2 and 1 strong victories against the Spanish Zone Ram and Yan Polter in Forsam and returned to Harre Poltar and Rary McCallry in two camps in Forsam.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, only two groups have come back from the four-point collisions, although only a Drove is needed to recover the Trophies of the Furik side as now.
After being second best for two days, however, it seems to leave them on Sundays.
North Korea said 'however' will not be disarmed in one way or another without faith.
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the existing ban is deepening confidence in the United States, and in this national situation there is no way to release their nuclear weapons.
At the annual general session of Rey Yong Ho of the World Organisation, North Korea said that last year the nuclear and nuclear tests were closed, the nuclear inspector was disrupted, and the nuclear technology and nuclear weapons were not promised to increase the scope of their weapons."
"Then we didn't see any similar reactions in the United States," he says.
"If there is no confidence in the United States, we will have no confidence in our national security and in this national situation there is no way of disarming us in a uniform manner."
Although he described North Korea's accusations against the "levelless" method of re-interpretation of nuclear disarmament in North Korea, his statement was apparent that he did not throw global disarmament at the same time, as Pinginging has done so in the past.
At the first meeting of the President of the United States and North Korea in June 12 of Singapore, Kim Jong Won and Donald's report on a joint statement, when Kim promised to work on the "permanent dissipation of Korean islands" and when the Tromp guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon his nuclear weapon.
The calls for strong international bans on North Korea have also been met by Washington.
"America "strengthened disarmament-first" and forced them to increase pressure by bans to achieve their goal, even against the declaration of the end of the war." Rei said.
"The abuses can put our ground at risk the idea of a mere dream for those who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the continued ban is deepening our disbelief."
There was no comment on the plan of the second summit between Ree Kim and the Tromp, which was held in the United States in the first week of the United States.
Instead of Minister Mohodi, Kim and South Korea's leader, who said three meetings between Mun Jain, last five months, said: "If this issue of disarmament were South Korea in the United States, it wouldn't be so strange about the disarmament of the Korean island."
Still, Rei's Sunday speech was dramaticly different from last year when he told the U.N. general about the U.S. core of the U.S. territory was indiscriminately targeting North Korean rockets when "Mr. Evil President" called Trump "Rake Man" suicide.
In this year's United Nations, Trump threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, he praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament action, but said that there was still much work to be done and that the restrictions would have to be lifted until North Korea was disarmed.
"If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't make any difference," said Trump on Wednesday.
China and Russia argued that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the steps taken by the U.N. Security Council
But the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey told Americans on Tuesday that "the restrictions of the grant council must be maintained effectively until we fully understand the fully verified disarmament."
The restrictions on North Korea have increased since 2006.
The UN General Assembly in Pompeii met with Rey in Esemble and then said that he would travel again next month to prepare for the second assembly.
Pompei has already travelled North Korea three times this year, but his last trip is not good.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said that some progress had been made, only North Korea had to condemn him for a few hours to "claim like a gondola"!
North Korea promised to break a missile site and a nuclear complex if the US "former system" took place this month."
He said that Kim was looking for the "related actions" that he was looking for was the security he provided in Trump Singapore and was moving towards normalizing his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are taking enough rest.
This year, Harvard University's new Caffeine-Zbalani course is opening the way for all its dancers to get more sleep on the night of the wake of the night."
One scholar has discovered that students at a number of universities in the world are often confused about the basics of how to care for themselves.
Harvard Medical School's medical teacher and Dr. Brigham and the woman's hospital have developed this course of Charles Sieller, who believes it's the first in the United States.
After giving a talk about what had affected the lack of sleep, he was moved to start the course.
‘At last, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I told that this day came to my senior year? ’
He said that no one ever told him about the importance of sleeping - what surprised me, he told the telegraph.
This course, which started for the first time in this year, explains how students can improve their overall health through good sleep habits and academic and athletic performances.
Harvard Medical School's leading director of the health care department, Paul Bereira, said students decided to start this course after they had been heavily out of sleep for the week.
An hour long course has some follow-up tasks.
There is a picture of a study room where students will know about the effect of caffeine and light on coffee, screens, trainers and books and how the Eleantic Performans sleep is affected and appreciate the importance of a bedtime routine.
In the other section, participants are told how long-term sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer
A map of the campus with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know it won't change the behavior of students immediately
But we believe that they have the right to know - as you decide to eat your cigarette, but also the right to know its effects on health, 'Professor Zillar added.
He says there is still a culture of pride in "Sarat" and he says more, a growing problem of sleeping because of the increasing pressure on modern technology and students.
To make sure your sleep is good enough to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, a student should be a 'secret weapon', he says - even making the sleepy brains miserable, making them hungry."
19-year-old Raymond So, who studied chemical and physical biology in California, helped design a course for Professor Sicilian, took a class in Harvard last year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to a campus-wide course.
In the next step, he hopes that before participating in the competitions, all the students in the competition will be asked to complete such a study program.
Professor Sigil recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed and when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light on the screen and LED light, which may destroy your Sardinian shadow, which may cause you to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The winner of the Mangar Goller Gerard.
In the Dolly Menger goal, Steven Gerard's Alemello team at Livenston saw Rangers win another Aee match because of their 1-0 battles with Livingston.
After the 4-1 rounds of St. John in February, the Ibras's team turned to another victory, but Gary Holt's team, as manager of 18th March, gave a second victory to Gerard, who took him to the heart of the Ledbrok’s first head.
Menga was hit seven minutes ago by Haf-time, but the desperate rangers could never touch them.
Rangers have now gone down to the sixth floor, Livingstone has gone up to the third floor and left the hibernian behind in the round.
And there may be more problems for Rangers because Linesman Calam Spence has to be treated for the loss of the head for the loss of the AA.
The Gerard group has eight changes that made the iron to the top at the Betfried Coffee Seminar.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Liv 11 that took a point from Harts last week and his handsome group was proud of how to breathe the opponent.
Rangers may have authority over their words, but Livingstone has done more than theirs.
Mengar's first Le-of-Alan MacGriger scored Scott Pittman only two minutes, but the midfielder lost its great opportunity.
One of Kakhan Jacobs's long free-kids had received Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgo was able to beat only in the back post.
The Rangers reruned the Bott, but there was more hope of their games than in the Final Thord.
Alfredo Morlos must have felt that he and Steven Lones had to get his panel in Quarter-Avar because of the conflict, but the reference Steven Thomson made the request to Colombia.
The Rangers can only target two shots in the first half of the year, but the ex-Ibroxy bulletproof Liam Kali was slightly in trouble with the head of Lasana Kublali and Ovi Ajaria shot.
Liver's 34-minute excitement was probably against the flow of the game, but no one can deny that they are their own master of the game.
Again, Rangers Jacobs failed to complete the Deep Set-Pis.
Scott Arfield did not respond to the decan Gallagher Scott Robinson's words, and he left his head cold to choose Menga for regular finance.
Gerard took the deal at the stop with Ryan Cant to replace Kulibali and the change was about to work together because the Wingar was in Morl, but the amazing Kali took him off the line.
Livingston viewers, however, began to play the game just as they enjoyed the game, sending a long voice after Lithgo and Halkate long balls.
Holt's team could have gone on their lead in the final phase, but McGregor's efforts to destroy the team's efforts to get rid of Lithko Korner.
The substitute Rangers of the late panalty with Jacobs again turned his face to the demand of Glen Middleton.
Almanac: Explorer of the Geiger counter.
And now a page of our "Sande Morning" Almanac: 30 September, 1882, from today 136 years ago ... the day naturalist Johannes Willem was born in Germany in the future.
A method for the detection and measurement of the liver is an invention known as the liver counter to the end.
Since then, a basic basis for science has become a core of the pop culture of the Geiger County, in 1950 at the "Bels of Cronado" film, possibly in the face of Kaupok scientists Rue Rajers and Del Ivans:
Man: "What's this again?"
Rogers: "It's used to identify a gigager counter, such as Ureniam.
When you listen to these phones, you can hear the effects of blood pressure on the cells."
Evans: "What's that saying?"
"Hans" Guy died a few days before his 63rd birthday in 1945
But his famous discovery is still alive.
The vaccine of the new cancer can teach the immune system to identify damaged cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to identify and kill damaged cells.
As part of the vaccine, the immune system learns to detect weakened cells
The method includes removing and modifying the cells that are resistant to rubella.
Then they can 'see' a common protein for cancer and then be reintroduced.
An experimental vaccine has shown promising results with patients with various levels of cancer.
A woman who has been treated with Vaccine, who teaches the immune system to identify the weakened cells, has seen her debauchery for more than 18 months.
The method is to remove the cells that are resistant to the rubella, to change them in the test so that they can "see" the common protein of many cancers called HER2 and then reintroduce the cells.
J Burfsky, a professor of U.S. National Cancer Institute in Maryland, says: "Our results show that we have a very hopeful vaccine."
HER2 explains that Professor Barzfsky explains that there are different types of cancers, including breast, debauchery, fusfus and colorectal cancer.
It has also done the same way to treat the cancer-resistant cells outside patients and "how to target cancer cells" in order to "learn" them.
Kanye West N.N.A. joined the pro-tramp dispute after a MAGA top.
It's not good.
Kanie West was shown at a bad performance studio during the night in Satard, where he praised the US President Donald Trump for staying in the summer of 2020.
After performing his third night song, called Guest Town, where he followed a Mac America Great Cap, he denounced the Democrats and reiterated his support for the Tromp.
"Sometimes when I talk to a white man, they say, "How do you like the Trump, he's a journalist?"
Well, if I were worried about the phenomenon, I would have come out of America a long time ago," he said.
The SNAL Matt Daemon launched the show with a sketch where the Hollywood star, Christian Blazi Ford, made fun of Bret Cavana's witness on the Senate's Legal Committee on Sexual Harassment.
Although it has not been broadcast, the film has been uploaded to the social media by the actor Chris Rock.
It's not clear if you tried to mock the West with the Rock Post.
Also, the West complained to the audience that he had to deal with the problem in the backstage as well.
"They put me in the backseat.
They said, "Don't go out the hat later"
They kicked me!
And then they said I'm in a shower, according to Washington Examiner.
The West also says, "Do you want to see the place?" He says he will fall into his "superman cap because it means you can't tell me what to do." "Do you want to see the world move forward?
Then try with love."
His comments were at least doubled from the viewers and the members of the SNL cast felt upset, the Varity reported, where one person told the publication that: "The whole studio had penthouse flexibility."
The West was brought as an option to the Guaika Ariana Grand, whose former lover, Apper Mac Mile, died a few days ago.
The West I Love It makes many confused like Parry's bottle at the song parry parry.
West Guard Group TPUSA has received support from Cances Turner, who tweeted: "One of the wise spirits: Thank you for standing up against the wicked."
But Toksho introduced Karen Hunter tweeted that the West was "what it was and she's very sad."
"Then I chose not to reward someone (to buy his music or clothing or to support his "art") who was injuring and spreading a harmful pattern for my community.
She's free.
And so do we," he added.
Prior to the show, this apper announced on Twitter that he changed his name and is now officially known as Canai West.
D is not the first artist who changed his name and followed his path, known as Paf Daddy, Pafi and PDD.
Another contemporary apparer, the name of Snap Dog was Snap Lion, and of course the Provincial Music Prince, changed his name to a character he had previously known as the Prince.

The game of the Thrones attacked the kite of Harington toxic masculinity or the wounded man.
Kit Herrington HBV is known for its violent role as a medieval fantasy series game of thrones.
However, a 31-year-old actor named Masho Nayak's stereotype says that the national role in the screen is to remind young boys that they have to be hard to respect.
He believes that when talking to Sande Times Calvary, Kit said, "Something has gone wrong," and asked how the toxic masculinity can cope with the problem in #MeToo.

'I personally, I feel very strongly, at this moment - where are we wrong men?' he said.
'When men were grown up, what did we teach them that we are now facing this problem?'
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing the toxic massculinity for its many male characters.
He added: 'What is simple and what are we learning?
What does TV and street show that children seem to follow this specific path if they are to become men?
I think it's really the biggest question of this time - how will we change it?
That is because the youths are in error manifest .

HIV/AIDS: 14% increase in new events in China.
China has announced 14% increase in HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820 000 people in the country, the Helth officers said.
Only 40,000 new events have been reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were the result of sexual assault, which has changed since the past.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spreading to various parts of China for the purpose of blood transfusions.
However, the number of HIV offenders has been almost zero, Chinese Helth officials said at a conference in the province of Yunan.
Although every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sex is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Chinese equality was allowed in 1997, but the LGBT is still considered to be a project against people.
Because of the country's conservative value, the study estimated that between 70 and 90% of men have sexual relations with men, they later marry women.
Many people are suffering from inadequate sexual protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised public access to HIV as part of its efforts to combat it.
Maxine Waters disables data from Zip senators, 'hazardous lies' and 'tool surveys'
The U.S. Saturday, the Republican Maxine Waters denied the claim that one of its employees posted personal information on Wikipedia by three Republican senators.
The Los Angeles Democrat strongly claimed that these requirements are being disseminated by the "Altra-Right Wing" and websites.
"A lie, a lie and a more hateful lie," the Waters tweeted.
The published information indicates that the US Senators' address and phone number are included, Senator, South Carolina's Lindsey Graham, and Mike Lee and Orin Hass, both Uttar.
This information was published online on Thursday, an unknown person posted to the Capitol when she heard about sexual abuse charges against the applicant Bret Cavanar in the Supreme Court.
After questioning the Cavana of the three senators, this bust came in a moment.
Protective sites such as the Gateway and Redstate reported that the IP address identified by the post was connected to the "Waters" office and published information to the Waters workers, Hill reported.
"This baseless charge continues to be a complete lie and a complete lie, "waters.
"Members of my workers - whose identity, personal information and protection has been exposed to this fraud and false accusation - were not responsible for the fraud.
This baseless accusation is completely wrong and a very false lie."
The White House's rapid statement of Waters has received many complaints online about the former press Scyb Ari Flash.
"This denial is angered," Felisha wrote.
"It says he doesn't have the freedom to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of what they have not done, they won't be angry.
They're not gonna be rebels.
Of course, they should not be questioned about the complainant's intentions.
They will certainly have peace and security."
The judge's reaction to the democrats' criticism of the cabinet was compared to the reaction of Waters to the Flasher, who felt he was very angry when he was hearing a loud voice on Thursday.
The Republican candidate Omer Navarro, who is electing Waters in the middle of the election, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's big," he tweets.
In his statement, Waters said his office warned "the authorities and law enforcement agencies concerned about these deceptive claims."
"We will make sure that the criminals will be released," he continued, "and my workers will be legally responsible for any member and all members of my staff who are destructive and dangerous for all their actions."
John English Strikes Agent Review - Weak Roan Atkinsen Secret
It is now traditional and seems to be useful for the restoration of the English-English Action-Comedy Spout French, which began in 2003 with the English-language and returned to the English-language Revolution in 2011.
Clearly, how many waste nations will we be able to make that self-defense issue new?
At any rate, the pop-student, the unstudented rabbi has a second-time license to create new things like that - its name indicates, rather than anything else, that it is an extensive comic book designed for the world's cinema of other languages than English.
He is certainly a stupid secret representative, who, despite the entourage of the delicate design, left a note in the 2012 Olympic Inventory of the Fire Theme Tune in a Dash and Cap in a Dolp London.
He was basically based on the Traveller, and the people of the international secret atkinson once forgot the Barklecard TV advertisements, and spread the confusion in science.
The last one has one or two losses in the outing.
I liked to see John English coming to a helicopter when I was in trouble with small helmets after the medieval arms.
Atkinson’s gift for physical beauty is shown, but the beauty has felt very low and strangely too, especially in 2007 and the "Syrias" film brand is now a part of self-confidence.
The risk seems to have been aimed at children more than adults, and I don't have any sense and focus on the silent-scattering drama of Atkins.
Over the years, the Topikala Foundation has been in serious trouble with Great Britain.
A cyber hacker hacked into the very secret web network of British intelligence, a small role unfortunately for Kevin Eld, to identify all British agents in the area, to disappoint the responsible agent.
It is the last trust of a prime minister who has already experienced the complete temple of politics, he is a miserable and bound person: Emma Thompson has made the best of his character with this half-terresa-but nothing more than to work in the script.
Her research advisors told her that every active secret was exposed, so she had to get someone out of the house.
And it means calling John English, who is now appointed as a school teacher in some of the behind institutions, but how the student will be trained outside of the record: there are some good jokes here, since English is offering the Rock-Type Academy School here.
For the urgent briefing, English Whiteh returned to the Whiteh and once again met with his former long-suffering side-circumbing baue.
Bau is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, a water-heckie-stick role, which has a bit of viky pepperdine being abused.
So Har Magesty's secret service fatally mistaken Batman and Robin back in action came back to the experience of Olga Corelenko's wife, Ophelia Bolitover.
Now, Prime Minister Carishmetic is dangerously falling into the magic of popular billionaires, who claims that he can solve the problems of the British computer: the sinister Jason Volta in Jack Lacey.
The English and Bau begin their far-reaching high-jink sound: they light a flash French restaurant on the windshield; they steal themselves from the Voltaire's billiards and steal from it; and the virtual reality of the home of the English Voltaire, trying to get to know themselves, to use the headset.
All the stops must have been designed for the final stage, but it's as small and expensive as it can be, in the whole, there are a number of children's thoughts on TV.
Very middle staff.
And I couldn't even imagine other English films: British film artist Roan Atkinson can't play any role that really does justice to his opponent?
Leber denies that it's planning to work four days a week for Britain, but it'll get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbin's lab party will consider a major plan that the British will work four days a week - but will pay for five days.
According to the report, the group wants the owners of the organization to share a further day's savings with workers in the summer through artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.
This will be seen as a three-day holiday for the workers - but it will still bring the same salary home.
According to the source, this idea will be 'fit' with the group's financial record and the workers are planning to move the country.
The Trades Union Congress has authorized the transfer of workers' economy to a four-week period.
A senior member of the Leber Party told The Sunde Times: 'A policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It won't happen at night, but four-day workdays are a wish that suits the group's method of saving the economy for the work of the team.'
Not the first to support this national idea, Green Party promised four days of work during its 2017 general election campaign.
The server does not support this kind of network connection.
A leader of the Leber Party said: 'A four-day business party is not a policy and it is not considered by the group.'
Mr. Shado Chansel used McDonald to express his views on a socialist revolution in the economy last week.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to return the ability of the "uninformed manager" and "beneficial" to the facilities.
The current shareholdings of the Shado chancellor's plans can get their entire share back because workers can 'stop' because of the wrong work done by the government.
He also confirmed the plan to keep employees on the board and make up the owner's table for 10 percent of the employees of the insurance companies, whose annual turnover is $500.
In Lindsey Graham, tell John Canadi "60 minutes" whether Kavanar's investigation can change their mind.
At least one week's final vote on the complaint against Judge Bret Kavana, the FBI Supreme Court asked whether Burora's investigations could turn their support to any Republican senator.
At a meeting on Sunday, reporter Scott Pelly asked the Republican Senators on "60 minutes", John Canedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could discover something that would lead them to change their minds.
Canadi South Carolina was more open than her partner.
"Man, of course," said Kennedy.
"I told you to go to the hearing room, I said I spoke to the judge in Kavana.
After the incident, I called him, and he came out and said, "Have you done this?"
"He was a strong, determined, and unyielding man."
Graham's vote, of course, seems unchanging.
"My Bret Cavana has developed a mind and a very important complaint will need to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Bret strongly rejected it," said Christine Blacie Ford, adding Graham.
"And they couldn't verify his name.
It's 36 years old.
I can't see any new changes."
What did the Global Citizen Festival do, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York there will be a Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has a distorted line-up of star performances and a equally interesting mission; the rest of the world's poverty.
In the seventh year of this year, the Global Citizen Festival will see only thousands of people on the central park in order to enjoy such acts as Jeanette Jackson, Cardie B, and Sion Mendes, but not to raise awareness of the reality of the event of extreme poverty in the 1930s.
Global Cities Festival, as described in 2012, is an extension of the global poverty project, which is an international campaign to increase the number of people who are active in fighting poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (if you don't want to pay for the VIP ticket), Consertgóir's multiple work or "activity" such as volunteering, e-mailing a university student, calling a phone or helping them to increase their awareness of their goal to stay in poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in achieving its goal for 12 years?
What is the idea of awarding people through a concert to call on people to take action, or another case of the so-called "Clictivism" - where people think they are really different by signing an online application or by sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more "action" than 19 million of its supporters, moving towards different goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to declare more than $37 billion as promises and policies that will affect the lives of 2.22 billion people by 2030.
By the end of 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and announcements that began with its action, with at least $10 billion already being distributed or raised.
The group's assumption that the protected Taliban has still had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main promises are the acquisition of neutrination, U.S.-based investors and partners "to help children increase their full potential", and the commitment to provide Rwanda 35 million to provide more than 4,700 sites in the wake of more tweets.
"With the help of the U.S. government, donor, national government and the Global City, we can make the social injustices of the East a landmark for history," Tracy Ulman told the public in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions have been taken by the United States to improve the well-being of mothers and children, the government has announced a project to provide money, which can reach 5 million women and children on the well-run side.
In answer to a frequently asked question on its website, "What do you think we can end the extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard path - sometimes we will read and fail.
However, like the great civil rights and anti-fraud movement in front of us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.

The U.S. Marines can use to stop the firefighting of the Russians to "depress" the ship.
In the Middle East countries, Washington can take refuge in its shipyard to prevent the coming of Russian fires, according to a description of the U.S. internal observer, Syb Ryan Jink.
Jeank accused Russia of interfering in Syria - markedly, where it works at the invitation of the legitimate government - of a failure to look at the new fuel market.
"I believe that the reason for their position in the East is that they want to power such as the Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe," he said.
And according to the authorities, there are ways and means of accepting it.
He says, "The United States has the ability to keep the sea free and, if necessary, to prevent their fires from being placed on the market."
In the United States of America, a non-profit group known as the "Jbalani Customers' Voice" spoke for participants at the event organized by the Energy Alliance of Conjugates.
He compared the use of Washington to Russia and Iran in the same way.
"Russia refers to "the cards held in Astín" with the economy of life-dependent fires, "to benefit Iran and Russia's financial options less from fire and substitution," he says.
These statements were made in order to help European customers, instead of Russia's Tromp Administration, when the natural gas exports to Europe are under threat.
As a result, President Donald Trump of the United States, with the authority of the Tromp Administration, is trying to get the Germans himself back from the "unsuitable" North Stream 2 pipeline project, it is in the hands of Berlin Moscow, according to the tromp."
Moscow Barbar stressed that the 11 billion US dollar North Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the power of the existing pipeline, is ready to go to 110 billion cubic meters - it is a fully economically compatible project.
Kremlin's argument is that the project is not just a financial issue because of the strong opposition of Washington, and this is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree that it is not possible to use the fire pressure as a tool and that customers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Minister of the Fire Department Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Minister Ric Peri in Moscow in September.
The situation in the United States has led to a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the German project.
In the field of art, the German Federation of German India (BDI) told the US to stay away from the bilateral agreement between European Union fire policy and Berlin and Moscow.
"After the recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Markel and President Vladimir Putin of Russia, the main German Indian (BDI) dieter, Camf said our biggest problem was in the hands of a third country under our fire.
Elizabeth Warren 2020, the Senator of Massachusetts, said in his application for president's proposals: "You'll find out."
Senator Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, says that after the internal election, he will "see" the petition for the president's pedas after election.
Warren, in a tunnel in the capital of Massachusetts, confirms that he is in competition.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and to make women come to the top," says Heil.
"After November 6th, I will strongly call the president's candidates."
Warren Town, as President Donald Tromp pointed out during the run, said that the troupe is driving the country in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing about our democracy," he says.
Brett Kavanawawag, the Supreme Court of Warren Trump and the Supreme Court of Trump, face a complaint.
On Friday's tweet, Warren says, "We need an FBI investigation before we vote."
On Thursday, a review was published, most of Warren's voters do not think he should fight in 2020.
The political research at the University of Safok, Centre / Boston Globe, said that 50 percent of Massachusetts's "possible" vote said that the senator should not fight.
Eighty percent supported the fight.
The review shows that the former Governor's support for the fight against the Devil Patrick's vote was more than that, where 38 percent supported the possible war and 48% did not.
Other high-profile democratic names that could be discussed during the 2020 vote include former vice president Joe Byden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
The Associated Press has announced that the biden will make an official decision in January.
The entire Pallin Donald Troupe quotes the PTSD of the Track Polin at the meeting
The 26-year-old Track Palin was born in Iraq a year after listing in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence
"In comparison with Oklahoma, she says to the audience at a Donald Trump meeting, "My son, through whom I come back, I can understand other families who can understand the outcome of the fight that has been waged by PTSD and our soldiers."
Palin calls his arrest "the thief" and says about his son and the other war-violents, "They come back a little, they come back a little hard, they come back, they wonder if the army and the military and other members of the army have any respect for their fellow workers?"
On Monday, he was arrested in Alaska, and according to Dan Bennet, a member of the police department, he was accused of having family violence, arms and drug abuse against a woman.
18 England, CD supports the challenge of a new security policy
Astrarot supports Ini Challenges against the new US policy against the UK and the District of Colombia, which refuses to protect the victims who are fleeing from gang or family violence.
NBC News reports that in order to support a refugee who challenges the policy, 18 England and the district representatives in Washington are responsible for a friend -ob-de-court briefing in the court on Friday.
The full name of Bartar in the Grace V Sessions case, which was not published in August against the US Civil Liberties Union Federal Policy.
He says that his associate "and his violent gang members" attacked him, but US officials refused his asylum on July 20th.
He was arrested in Texas.
Actors from Greece support the example of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, largely as a country facing the problems of gang and family violence, from which there are many applicants for refuge in the United States.
The New American Refugee Policy Board reversed its 2014 decision to apply for the asylum of refugees who fled for domestic violence.
The District of Columbia, Attorney General Carl Rezin said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "has ignored the UK, the federal and international laws of many decades."
Friend -ob-court Bryf says, "This federal law requires all refugees to be judged according to specific information and circumstances, and this national ban violates the main purpose."
According to the statement, the Atrnini argues that the anti-immigrant approach to entry is affecting the economy of the United States, because it is more likely that they will be encouraged and that they provide "necessary work".
Atrni General Jeff Sessions Immigrant Judges ordered that family violence and gang violence be avoided in June.
"People, religion, nationality or a particular social group can be protected by persecution or fear for membership or political opinion of those who have left their country," the session announced its policy on 11 June.
To say safe never solve all the problems - even all the deadly problems - that people face all over the world every day.
The number of deaths in the effort to save lives doubled and the death toll
The state of the North was afraid of the survivors.
"The 35-year-old Lisa Kusuma in the centre of the city of Palu said to provide comfort to her cubs, "it was very interesting."
"Just a minute is coming to Ambulance.
Clean water cannot be found."
In an attempt to save what can be found in the pool of water, the residents have returned to their homes for destruction.
Hundreds of people are injured and 7.5 injured in hospitals.
Some injured people, including Du Harris, who broke their back and legs, have been kept outside the Army Hospital, are being treated under the sky because of the force next campaign.
During the five-floor hotel room with the woman and the woman, he wept to express the feelings of the fearsome earthquake.
"There's no time to save the victims.
I was trapped in the middle of a broken valley, it seems," Newspaper representative Harris added that they had come to the city for a wedding event.
"I hear my wife's cries for help, then calm down.
I don't know what happened to her or my children.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Army has filed a complaint against China by "Propaganda Advertising"
After a week of publishing a four-page ad on the U.S. newspaper, a government of China reportedly accused the US press of engaging in a targeted campaign against China's US Army Beijing.
The U.S. President Donald Trump, the largest Chinese daily Daes Mines registry on Wednesday last Wednesday, filed a supplement to the US Congress election on 6 November, China rejects this complaint.
Tromp's complaint is that Beijing is trying to intervene in the US elections, which US officials have told Reuters as a new attempt by Washington to pressure China.
This is a natural event that the foreign government will announce for the commercial campaign, but Beijing and Washington have now come down to the trade war, which has increased the amount of shell in each other's imports.
China and US experts say that China's vindictive shells, such as Iwa, were designed to harm the reformers in the UK who supported the Republic of Trump's first war.
The U.S. Army and former Governor Terry Branstad, who is a great farmer in China, says that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In a letter to the Das Mines Registry on Wednesday, China says, "We have now doubled the momentum by our own self-inflicted press."
Branstad writes, "The Chinese government is taking the illicit advantage of the long history of freedom of speech and free news in this propaganda campaign by giving money to the Dash Mines Registry."
"On the other hand, you will find limited opposition voices on the streets of Beijing, and you will not see the real contradiction between the Chinese people's sensitive economic path, because the media is in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He also says that his letter "refused to print a Chinese newspaper", although he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Before the midterm, the Republicans wanted to keep women voters away from the Kavanf debate, the analysts warned
Analysts have been standing and hiding alongside the Supreme Court's Bret Cavanf in several complaints of a multi-story Republican sexual assault, warning them that they will be able to see a response from women especially in the upcoming midterm elections.
The issue has become more and more intense, and most Republicans are already looking forward to moving forward with the vote.
In a paper published on Saturday, Professor of State at the University of Siracuse, Maxwell School, Grant Riare Hill, said, "They can't come back in any way."
Rihar says that he is suspicious of the pressure of Senator Jeff Flek (Arizona) to calm the angry voters in the final moment for the F.B.I. investigation.
According to Washington D.C. magazine, the senior counsel of the progressive movement group and national female facilitator Karen Jean-Pierre said on Friday: "Do not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and November."
Despite the testimony of Dr. Christian Blazi Ford, the decision of the Department of Justice Committee of the Republicans to move forward on Friday morning, protestors at the Senate's Heloway protests "November!" reported Mike.
"Native political analyst Stu Rothenburg told the news site," democratic excitement and inspiration will be past.
"He says there's already too much; it's true.
However, it may be more, especially among the women of the city, and among the young voters from 18 to 29 years of age, who do not often vote because they do not like the president."
Even before testifying to Ford's public allegations of sexual assault against a candidate elected by the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that if Republicans proceed with approval, it could be a policy.
"It is a difficult matter for the GPS," the former Chairman Michael Styl Enbisi told news of the Republican National Committee last week.
"It's not just the committee's vote or the final vote or the cabinet, how the Republicans have handled the issue and how it has been used in it," Peritarians U.S. Group, who assist the Democrats in the vote, told their director, Gay Cecil News Channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe in the testimony of Fords and Kavanf, and the next comment was heavy.
A new review in Yugoslavia shows that 41 percent of respondents are sure to believe the testimony of Ford, where 35 percent say they believe, or perhaps they believe in Kavanf.
Also seen, 38 percent said that they thought that Cavanf probably lied at the time of his testimony, and only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, FBI is currently investigating the complaint of Ford and one of the youngest complainants, Debora Ramirez, a Guardian's report.
Ford testified in front of the District Justice Committee last week that he was lenient among the Kavanf Nash at 17 years of age.
Ramirez complains that in the 1980s, Supreme Court Nomini showed him his girlfriend at a party in Yale's study.
The World Wide Web has planned to start a new internet for fighting with Google and Facebook.
The World Wide Web's creative team is starting to compete with Burns-ley Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology is, Inept, a company that builds the Open Source Platform for Burns-Ly.
The users of Solid are allowed to choose where their data will be stored and what information people have access to.
In a meeting with the fast company, Bernards-Lee said that the real goal of Inrupt was "world authority".
"We have to do it now," he says about the start.
"It's a historical moment."
This application allows you to create P and D or "Personal Online Data Store" using the Solid technology.
These include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Sptifai all in the same browser and at the same time.
Personal online data storage is unique because it depends entirely on the user – who can access any kind of data.
The company named "Personal Power through Data".
According to Cio John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt will help all to acquire the resources, processes and appropriate skills.
The organisation is currently with a security platform purchased by Burnars-Li, Bruce, IBM, some of the agreed on-staff developers and volunteer codes.
This week, global technology developers will be able to create their own independent applications using tools available on the Import website.
Burners-li said that he and his team "will start a complete change with Facebook and Google where all their business models will be completely changed"
"We don't want permission from them."
In a post on Saturday's media, Burns-ley writes that the import "is intended to protect the integrity and quality of the new web and to provide a facility for protecting the integrity and quality of the new web"
In 1994, Burners-Li Massachusetts Institute of Technology set up a World Wide Web Consortium to transform the Internet.
In the last few months, Burns-ley has become a strong voice in the net's inseparability debate.
Would Burns-ley World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute also be the founder and director of such integration?
"I am impossible hopeful about this future age of the web," Burnars-lie added.
Bernard Van: Victoria Cross Clinic of the First War
The centenary of the city celebrates the only priest of the Church of England who won Victoria Cross during the first world war.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend Bernard Van won the prize on September 29, 1918, when the Benenglis and Lehancott were attacked.
In any case, he was killed four days later by an ally and never knew that he had received the highest British military honor.
On Saturday in Northamptonshire, his two granddaughters discovered his memorial in a koskuwawawa.
One of his aunt Michael Van says that it's "incredibly obvious" that his grandfather's locker is being opened 100 years later.
According to London Gaget, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van "led his battalion through the great gullies of Khusha and Field and Machinegan" during the Saint-Quantin channel.
Then he walks on the fireline and leads the line with the "Serbosch Courage" and only joins a field song and gives three enemies a shot.
Lieutenant Colonel Van Van was killed in the hands of a German soldier on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, says his grandfather's actions are "something I could never do and respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van Kuscawaz, were the leader of the Brandoud Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van says, "I feel the horror of the parade," and he says more, "A real flower is shown in the support of many people."
MM was up all night to see 206 billionaires, but instead they found Pepa Pig.
Imagine that you woke up all night to see a great baller 206 and the main event didn't show up.
There were 13 feet on the base of the bill from San Hose, and on channel 5, U.S. live all night.
On the sixth morning, when the Ggard Mousaci and Rary McDonald were preparing to face each other, the cover turned into a pago and killed the United Kingdom viewers.
In particular, they were awake until the morning, so some people became angry.
On Twitter, one of the favourites described children as "a kind of dirty risk" in return for the cartoon.
"They were forced to exchange children's cartoons at 6 p.m. on the basis of all the rules," said Co-Chair-Chairman Dave Shoaring in the answer to the question.
""Pepa The Pig," yes."
Bellato's president Scott Kokar says that the future will be about making time for future United Kingdom audiences.
"We'll probably be able to solve this during the refill." Kokar said.
"Then I will not be able to do this until Friday mornings and Sundays.
But we're working on it.
Believe it, when it's switched, a lot of messages followed and they weren't very friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it might be a technological error.
But no, it was a government matter.
I promise it won't happen again.
We will reduce it to five feet instead of six - as we usually do - the revolution has happened in an attempt to increase the number of fans.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Disc: Tom Deli has suffered "in shame" because of sexuality.
The Olympic Diver Tom Deli said that when she grew up, she felt humiliated because of sexuality - but it inspired her to succeed.
This 24-year-old says he doesn't go to high school until he doesn't realize that "everyone's not like me."
When he spoke on the first radio of Lauren Lavern, he said that he spoke about equal rights in the "hope" of others.
He also says that after the birth of the child, his thinking about his Olympic victory has diminished.
The regular representative of the event, Christie Young, has taken a few months off due to the disease.
In the first event in Lavern, Delly said that he felt "small" more than everyone else because "boys like girls weren't socially acceptable."
He said, “To this day, the feeling of being a little bit different has proved true, which has helped me to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove himself a "something" so that everyone could know about his sexuality so that everyone would not be disappointed.
Two times in the Olympics, Bronze Wini has become a high-profile Aljibite preacher and has used his presence in the Commonwealth Games this year to invite more countries to acknowledge the unity.
He says he opened his mouth because he was able to survive in public without difficulty and wanted to "hope" others.
This three-time World Championship is about to read a man's love -- American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, with whom he appeared in 2013 -- "I was amazed."
Delly married the gunman, who was 20 years older than he was last year, who said there was no problem with age.
"When you're so young," she went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and her father died of cancer three years later, saying that it was hard to find someone who had seen such a rush in life.
The couple gave birth to a son named Robert Ree Black-Dellie in June and Delly said that his "full view" had changed.
He says, "If you asked me last year, I would say, 'I have to win a gold medal' that was my mind.
"In fact, there is a bigger thing than the Olympic rider.
Ruby is my Olympic champion."
His son's name was his father Robert, who died at the age of 40 in 2011.
Delly says his father never admitted that he was going to die and finally asked if their ticket was confirmed for London 2012 - because he wanted to stay in the first row.
"I never could say that 'you won't be in the first row anymore," he said.
"I held his hand when his breath stopped and he left his last confidence and died, and I did not admit that he was indicted," he said.
The next year, Deli will take part in the 2012 Olympics and win the Bronzepard.
He says, "It was my whole life's dream to give my eyes to the Olympics, and it's no better feeling."
It also inspired her first preference for her song - Hidar Smol's forum - which was named after her in the Olympics and which still gives her a smile in her mouth.

You'll be sitting in the bank on the cab driver of Michaelson's off-form.
American Phil Michelson will build a record of his 47th Ride Cap match on Sunday, but if he wants to not be a miserable Milton, he will have to return his form.
Michaelson, who played the record 12 times in this two-year event, has been sitting in the bank in exchange for Captain Jim Furik on Saturday and Forsam.
Instead of staying in the center of Halsal, which he was playing in the U.S., the 5th day of the winner cut off the cheerleader and took off his game in the ranks.
The 48-year-old title of this 48-year-old golf national course is not suitable for a long-term Raf race.
And if the course itself is not bad enough, Michaelson, 9th of March, meets the British Open Champion Francisco Molinary, who won their four matches this week together with Ruki Tommy Fleetwood.
If Americans, who are four points down at the beginning of the 12 Singles match, can begin well, Michaelson's match can be important proof.
Foryk showed confidence in him, even though he didn't have much to say.
"And today he fully understood his role, held my hands and said he was ready for tomorrow."
"He has great self-confidence.
He's one of them, and he's been giving this team a lot of stuff this week.
I didn't think they'd play the two games.
I was hoping more, but that's what happened and we were thinking about moving on that way.
He wants to name the field, just like everyone else."
On Sunday's match, Michaelson will play the record of the most Ride Cap match in the city of Nick Faldor.
It can end up in a radar cap that doesn't even follow his personal record.
Michaelson's battalion has 18 wins, 20 prizes, and seven prizes, although Furik says that his presence brings the team back to life.
"And fun people, amude, smart people, love people to dance, like a team room and a great person," he says.
"I think the new players enjoyed playing with him, even this week, which is very good to see.
He's just giving more than playing."
The European Captain Thomas knows that a great lion can be invisible.
Thomas Bjørn, a European captain, knows from experience that an unexisting situation can be created on the last day of the Ryder Cup with a big lead.
In the 1997 battle in Valdarama, where the leading group of Savi Balestros won five points with the Americans, only at the narrowest margin won the funding line at 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that there was a great lead in prosperity; there was a great lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in prosperity, where we live, but only in space," Bjorn said, in the picture, he was seen on Friday and yesterday in the Golf National in 2018 from 10-6 to 5-3.
History will show me and the team that it's not over yet.
Come on in full enthusiasm tomorrow.
Get on the ground and do the right thing.
Not until there's no point in the board.
We have a target, it's trying to win Trophies, and it's gonna keep our eyes on the birds.
I've always said that I'm looking at 12 players in my team, but I'm also very aware of who we are.
Bjørn adds, I am happy that our players have done what they did in the hard golf course. "I will never be very confident about it.
Tomorrow's a different war.
Tomorrow's personal forums will come, and it's a different thing.
When it's all right, it's great to be with the partners, but when you're alone, your ability as a golfer is tested.
This message needs to be delivered to all players for the best time.
Now, you have to throw away your partner and get the best out of it."
By contrast, the opponent will be watching Jim Furik so that players can play as a team that is better in private, except for Jordan Spith and Justin Thamas, who brought three points between the four points.
Forurik himself has gained the two-day experience of the film-revolution as part of the "Morning Event" in Europe as part of the winning group in Brooklyn.
He said, "I remember every word."
"We've got 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'll want to get rid of starting fast like Brooklyn and Madina.
When the game gets stuck one side, the middle matches get a lot of pressure.
We'll make a lineup like that, and just as we think we should name the boys, we're actually going to do some magic tomorrow."
Paul Cassie, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Polttar were given the responsibility of leading Thomas against Europeans, who will face Rory Mcler in the Shoru Match.
"I've managed this group because I think it will cover everything," Bjørn said about his singles election.
A new warship in Germany is suspended
According to local news reports, Germany's newest party was to be launched in 2014 to replace the cold warship of the former Cold Age, but it will not be until at least one year later due to the use of the poor system and snobling.
As mentioned in Dai Zeit magazine, the first ship of the New Baden-Wertemburg series to launch the "Rinland-Falz" was suspended until the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but this was a major problem because of the next delivery problem.
In 2007, the four vessels ordered by Budden-Warttemburg will be replaced by Bremen-Class Frigatet.
It is known that they will contain powerful Kaman, Anti-Aircraft and Anti-Ship Squads, some of the stylistic technologies, such as recycled radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include long-term monitoring - new frigates will be possible for a maximum of two years away from the country's port.
Whatever the case, the untimely delay of the modern warships - which will help Germany to display power abroad - will be lost when the water is called, the news of Die Zeit.
Last year, the F 125 Froget came under the title when the German Navy refused to launch the ship and returned to Hamburg's flower and voiceshipyard.
This is the first time a ship is sent back to the shipyard after the ship's delivery.
The reasons for the return have been very little known, but the German media points to a number of important "software and hardware errors" that will unravel the ship in the war.
The software's rings are particularly important, because the Baden-Wartenberg-class ships will be run by about 120 sailors -- half the population of the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was seen that the ship was moderately heavy, which would diminish its performance and create a barrier to the future upgrade of the Navy.
The 7,000 tons of "Rinland-Falz" is thought to be twice as heavy as German ships using the same category during World War II.
In addition to the wrong hardware, the whole project with crusader training has become a problem.
The primary level has reached 3.1 billion pounds (3.6 billion dollars) amazingly from 2.2 billion pounds.
The recent warning of the collapse of German ship power has made new frigates more important.
In the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bertels of the German Parliament's Defence Committee admitted that the ship "is going to fly the appropriate ship of Mauten" in the Navy.
This officer said that the problem had been resolved over time, because no replacement ship had arrived since the ships had been cancelled.
He regrets that no vessel of the Baden-Wertemburg class has been able to join the Navy.
Listening to the National Trust in the Secret Life of the Birds
A new research is being carried out in an estate of the Scottish Parthetan region to learn how to use peanuts in search of food.
It is hoped that the search will shed fresh light on the behavior of this unique flying creature and help save the future.
The National Trust for Scotland scientists will be researched with the common and sophisticated pipelines and with the debentons of the Invariu Garden of Western Ross.
In order to track the performances of the birds in the entire moosum, the special recorder area will be located in an important area around the area.
NHS workers and volunteers will also use portable detectors.
The expert will analyse all the recording sounds and describe the compositions of the callees, and will report on what the nation is doing.
Then a visual map and reports will be created to create a vesicle-scale image of their behavior.
The NTS type of conservation advisor hopes that the results will show that some areas of residence are the most important and how they are used by each nation.
This information will help to determine how the habitat can be protected for the benefit of management, such as the landscape and the landscape and other related populations.
Over the last century, the number of frogs in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined greatly.
For building and development, they are in danger of damaging their sleeping and home.
Wind-based turbines and light-based devices may be at risk, as may be from some chemicals of the floppypers and building devices, besides the attack of the wearers.
The storm isn't really blind.
Even so, their ears are more effective than their eyes because of their habit of hunting at night.
They use an improved echo-location technique to mark dangers and obstacles in the widow's path.
NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings throughout the country, 38 major initiatives and 76,000 hectares of land, have been important to the desert.
There are ten trained experts who conduct regular exams, visit sleepplaces, and sometimes recover.
The organisation has set up the first and only requested shelters in Scotland in the Drive State of Dumfreiz and Galoy, where there are eight residences between the ten villages of Scotland.
Asset Manager David Thompson says, this is the model area for bastards.
"There's a good area for birds in the Trive," he says.
"There are old buildings, there are many old trees and there are all good residences.
But much more is not yet known about birds, so what we do here and elsewhere will help us to understand more about what we need to do to save them."
He stresses the importance of knowing the presence of a frog before saving the property, because it can cause the destruction of a mother’s residence by the destruction of 400 drugs and children, and can only signal the total number of local mosquitoes.
It is not lawful to kill, torture, or destroy a wild animal or to destroy its habitat.
Sketch Officer Elizabeth of the Reserve Trust has been encouraged to help the public.
He says, "We still have a lot to know about children, and we don't know anything about how many people live."
Ronaldo denied charges of rape, and lawyers are continuing to file a case against the German newspaper.
He describes the charge of rape as "false news" saying that people want to "widen out" with his name.
His lawyers are ready to file a case against German News Magazine Deer Spigel, who brought this complaint out.
In 2009, Kathryn Majoirga, in a hotel in Las Vegas, was accused of rapeing an American woman.
He was accused of giving him $375.000 to keep quiet about the event, reported on Friday by Dr. Spigel.
A few hours after the claim came out, Ronaldo, 33-year-old, commented on the report as "false news" when speaking to his 142 million-year-old Flora in his instagram live video.
"No, no, no, no.
Today, what they have said is lies," said Ballon-D-O's winning camera on Friday.
"They want to increase their contacts using my name.
It's a normal thing.
My name says they want to be known, but it's a part of life.
I'm a happy man and everything's going well." The player said more in laughter.
According to Reuters, Ronaldor's lawyers are preparing to file a complaint against Dr. Spigel, whom they called "indisputable report on privacy".
Legal Christian Sherz says the player should seek compensation "for the moral damage that may be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times".
In June 2009, the story was mentioned as being held in a hotel in Las Vegas and Casino.
According to a paper submitted to the Neverard Clark County District Court, after a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the house where he was brutally raped.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo will be released after that event and tells her that "99 percent" "good people", "one percent" will be disappointed.
The document claimed that Ronaldo confirmed that they had sexual intercourse, but it was acceptable.
Myorga further claimed that he had gone to the police and had taken pictures of his injuries in the hospital, but then he was tried outside the court because he was "feared for revenge" and was afraid to be "degraded in public".
The 34-year-old said that he now wants to re-establish the verdict because he has been mentally disturbed by the incident.
During that crime, Ronaldo Manchester was in the middle of joining Real Madrid from the United States, and in this crisis he has joined the famous Italian club Jove in the agreement of $100 million.
Braxit: Losing position as a car manufacturer, you 'll regret it forever'
Trade Minister Greg Clark says that after Brexit, the United Kingdom will be the first to lose its position in the world to make cars after Brexit.
He adds that it is "disquieting" that the United Kingdom has said in Toyota's BBC that if they leave the British U without any agreement, they will temporarily close their production at Darby's factory.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
This Japanese car manufacturer said that people can go to work for a limited period without a contract.
Burnston's factory - built by Toyota Aris and Avenue - has produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, with approximately 90 percent of them exported to the rest of the European Union.
In Burnston, Twitter Managing Director Marvin Cook says, "I believe that if Britain comes out of U at the end of March, our production may be stopped."
With Honda, BM Dublow and Jaguar Land Rover, the other Uke’s motor vehicle manufacturer has expressed concern about the European Union without any agreement.
For example, B.M.D.D. said that they would close their mine plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns that car makers say are the dangers of Sapley Chain without a contract.
The Twitter production line is based on "just-in-time", a 37-minute machine from both suppliers for the ordered car.
If it leaves the U.S. on 29 March without any agreement, the border can be disrupted, causing the agency to delay in the body and to face the crisis of the agency as a commercial milestone.
The agency said that the Twitter Darbisha plant could not keep more than one day's worth of investment, which could cause the product to shut down.
Mr. Clark says that in the future, Thessa May's chess plan for the relationship with the U is "adequately implemented to avoid this kind of check."
"We need a deal, and we want to do the best we can not only succeed, but we'll also be able to enjoy the possibility of future progress," she said at the show today on the BBC Radio 4.
"Not only the toy, other producers say it is very important to maintain the success of the Sapley Chain system."
It is impossible to say how many days the production will be closed, but they have warned that long-term costs will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and can result in a lot of work going on.
Working in Burnston for 24 years, and the Union Ahwajak Peter Suvalaris of the plant said his members were alarmingly saying, "They will not return once they have gone through my experience.
A government spokesman says: "We have to keep a definite and credible plan for the future with this U."
White House reported that the Tromp meeting with Rosenstein could be more delayed.
On Sunday, the White House announced that a high-profile meeting with the Attorney General Rod Roosestein could be held "after a week" between the First Court of Nine Bret Cavanf and the Donald Trump.
Rozstein, a special adviser to Robert Mueler, who is investigating the potential constraint of the president in the Russian elections, has called into question the actions of Russia's campaign, the partner of the troupe and the connection between Russia and Russia.
The tromp duputi Atrni General has been working for several months in Washington to see if he will be able to solve the problem of Mueller's freedom.
In the beginning of this month, the use of secret Mike to record talks with New York Times Tromp and the removal of the president through the 25th revisions has been reported by Rozstein in marble.
Rozstein rejected the report.
But he's going to give up on a report like this, and he said he went to White House last Monday.
Instead of announcing a meeting with the Tromp Thursday, the Tromp was then in the United Nations office in New York.
Trump said he would "do not prefer Rozstein," but the meeting was held in the presence of Dr. Christian Blazi Ford, both witnesses, to avoid hearing the section committee's hearing of the Senate.
On Friday, a week-to-week FBI investigation was ordered to charge against Trump Kavanf, with the full vote of the whole Senate being postponed.
The press secretary of the tromp was on Friday's Fox News.
He says about meeting with Rosstein: "It's not a good date, it can be a week, it can be another week for other things in the Supreme Court.
But let me show you, and I always want to tell the media."
Some journalists objected to this statement, and no press briefings were issued after Sanders on 10 September.
Performer Chris Wallace asked him why.
Sanders says that because they don't have a briefing, it's not for "showing people," even though he says, "I don't deny that they've done things to show people."
He then recommends that direct communication be made between the tromp and the press.
"The current president has more questions than any previous president has," he says without any evidence: "We have judged that number."
In the future, Sanders says, "If the news media can ask the President of the United States directly, it's better than talking to me.
We're trying very hard and you've seen us do this over the last few weeks, and we've been talking directly to the President of the United States instead of the press briefing."
Tramp regularly takes part in the press conference with guests who are away from the White House or in the emergency sessions.
A single press conference is very low.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, unusual work can be done and, in the meantime, there may be a riot in front of the journalist group.
Health Minister N.H.S.S. Scotland writes a letter to the fear of the U.S. workers in Brexit
The Ministry of Health of Scotland has thanked European Union workers working in NHS and expressing their desire to stay in the future.
Jean Freeman M.S.P., U.K. sent a letter just six months before leaving U.S.
The Scottish government has already promised metabarism for the government services of the U.S. citizens.
In her letter, Freman writes: There is a continuing discussion between Uke and U, which is expected to result in a crisis throughout the winter.
But the U.S. government is also preparing for the possible uncontracted situation.
I know you're all going through a lot of trouble.
That's why I want to remind you again how much I value their contributions, especially for each member's nationality.
Workers from all over the European Union and outside of it have gained valuable experience and skills that have strengthened and improved health services and have benefited the sick and our community.
Scotland is your country and we want you to stay here."
After a headache, Christian Abercromb’s emergency emergency
Mike Organ of Tennessee reported that the Christian Abercrombian of Tennessee State Tigers, at the end of the race, was forced to fight at Vandarbit Commodores on Saturday 31-27 after being beaten in the war.
The chief of the state of Tennessee told reporters that the hit was just past the time.
Read says, "He's on the sideline getting so hard."
Teachers and investigators placed oxygen in Abercromik as a sideline and then returned to test.
A tennis state official in Nashville, Dblu S.M.V., told Chris Harris that the Vanderbillt Medical Center was outside Abercrombie's asteroid.
Harris adds that "there is no description of the type of injury yet" and is trying to know when the tennis state is being hit.
After moving from Illinois, the second year of the red shirt student Abercrombie, with Tennessee State, played the first moosom.
On Saturday before leaving the game, he had five totals, with 18 totals.
Foreign creators have to give more stamps when they buy property in the United Kingdom
Under Tori's plan, when foreign creators buy new property in the United Kingdom, they have to give more stamps to them and use this extra money to their hosts.
This step will enhance the success of Corbin's campaign to attract young voters.
These stamps will be applied to those who do not allow the United Kingdom to do so.
The Trejary expects more money to be available for the aid of large-scale households by the year, up to £120 million.
When foreign creators buy some property in the United Kingdom, they have to give more stamps – and this extra money will be used by households, Thessa May will announce it today.
This step will further enhance the success of the company's efforts to attract young voters, including housing supplies and high-ranking targets.
These stamps will be applied to individuals and organisations who do not work in the United Kingdom, and additional funds will need to be used by households.
In addition to the current stamp Hulk, more than three percent of the charges were dropped in the second house and paid in the second house two years ago.
The Trejary hopes that it will reach £120 million over the year.
Approximately 13 percent of London's newly created total assets have been bought by residents outside the United States, which has increased prices and made the situation more difficult for the first residents.
Most of the country's famous regions - especially the capital - have become the "unidentified city" by foreign Croatians in most cases.
The new policy came a few weeks after the invitation of Boris Johnson Stamp Schulk's call to the young generation to their first home.
He has charged the increase in the cost of wealth without buying land against large-scale construction organizations and calls for the abolition of the value of the house in order to solve the "dwelling problem" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announces an attractive series of proposals for a reform, including pay control and "no-flat" accommodation.
He wants to give the Council more power to create a new house.
Ms. May said: "Last year I said that I would reclaim my prime ministership in the British dream recovery - which is to be a more beautiful life for every new generation.
And his meaning is to rent a broken house.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it cannot be settled that foreign and foreign non-United Kingdom non-profit organizations will buy hard-working British residents as easy as they do.
Many people have lost their dreams of homeowners, and the problem of homelessness has indeed been solved.
Jack Ross: 'My final dream is to take responsibility for Scotland'
Sanderland Boss Jack Ross said that his "final desire" was to be managed by Scotland one day in the future.
The 42-year-old residents of Scotland are currently experiencing the challenge of restoring the North-East Club, which is now in the third place in the League One, three points behind the first team.
In the last Moosum, he went to the summer stage of the Light with St. Mary's return to the Scottish premiere.
"I wanted to play country as a player.
I've got a B-cap and so far, says the Sports Sound of Ross Biscee Scotland.
"Then I grew up in the game of Hampden with my father in childhood, and it always keeps me behind.
If I succeed in managing the club, this can only happen."
As a Sanderland Manager, Ross's predecessors include Dick Advocket, David Moes, Sam Alardis, Martin O'Neil, Roy, Gus Poette and Paulo De Canio.
The former Alya Athletic Boss says he has not felt disappointed by rejecting the name of the big club, such as Burnsley and the Episwich Town.
"At this point, I'll be able to measure my success, 'can I bring this club back to the premium league?'
It is certainly due to the structure and utility of the club," she said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'll probably see myself as a success if I can get the club back there."
The age of Ross’s manager’s life is only three years after he has spent 15 months as a coaching staff in Dumberton and Harts.
Then he helped to restore the light to the third level from Atmanon and later to convert Saint Maryen from the door of Atmanon to the Championship.
And Ross says that he now feels free to play here than Clyde, Hartlpool, Falcark, St. Mary and Hamilton academics.
He recalls taking responsibility for the light, "It was probably a real Milton."
"I really believed that management was better for me than gambling.
It's strange to hear it because I've done the right thing, I've lived the motam out of it, and I've enjoyed some success.
But the game is hard.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel the same way about working pressure, so the management is right.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it, it's the most voluntary thing I've ever had in my whole life."
You can hear the full meeting at the Sports Sound on September 30, from 12:00 to 13:00 B.C.E. on Radio Scotland.

The heat of the winter has increased in the British baths, but the restaurants have put pressure on China.
The sale of bars increased by 2.7 percent in July - but the collection of restaurants has decreased by 4.8 percent.
“An unexpected long-term participation in the UK’s Open Road and World Cup,” says Peter Martin, a business consultant of the CSA company, “will remain the same as last June, when the sales of mushrooms have increased 2.8 percent and the sales of restaurants have declined.
In June, 1.8 percent of the restaurants in the business were worse than in July.
The drinks and bars have so far been very good and the sale of the restaurants has been so bad.
The main food cans are also hot, but they are not sold below the restaurants.
It looks like people are just going out for a little bit of a drink.
All pubs and bar sales have increased 6.6 percent this month, and food sales have decreased by three percent."
The position and authenticity analyst and SM's Paul Neuman said: "The trend of the end of April is still continuing.
The biggest impact on the weather and big social or play events in the market outside the house is the biggest.
It is not surprising that the rest groups will be in a difficult situation, but this 4.8 percent of the annual sales will be particularly sad.
It's time to tell the main food operators not to come out of long and hot winters in bad weather and let them know if the cool weather of August will bring some relief."
In July, there was an increase of 2.7 percent in total sales, with new refurbishments and the restaurants, reflecting a decrease in sales in brand roll-outs.

Each of the five children has a private social media account that they hide with their parents
The review revealed that one of the five children - some 11 years of age - have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
The "Non-Insta" page has been published in a survey of 20,000 high school students.
The news revealed a fear that sexual content is being posted
Hundreds of deaf students say there is a "main" account to show their parents
One of the five children—some of them are hiding a social media account from 11 years of age.
"Only Insta" - the website of the sharer's website is linked to a rapid increase in the account.
The news revealed the fear that sexual content is being posted.
Hundreds of deaf students say they also have a transparent "principal" account to show their parents.
A mother who saw the hidden site of her 13-year-old daughter, saw a young man calling out to others, "Shoot me."
A study of Digital Aurenes U.K. and the Headmasters and Headmasters Conference (HMSC) found that between 11 and 18 years of age, there are two 40 percent of the profiles that have been acknowledged by half of them as a secret account.
H.M.C. Chief Mike Buchanan says: "It's interesting that children-kissors are going to create places that parents and teachers can't find."
Elliptical Doyle Scottish Athletics Board "Vous for Athletics"
At the annual general meeting of the Governing Body, Elid Dowell was elected as an executive director of the Scottish Athletics Board.
The most successful track and field athletes in Dowell Scotland described this step as a bad opportunity for players to benefit from their extensive international experience in the past decade.
"The Scottish, U.S. and the World Athletics community are highly respected, and we are sure that the Athletics Board in Scotland will benefit them in a great deal," Billie said.
Doyle says, "I'm interested in working as a voice for athletes and I hope I can really help Scotland's game and move it forward."
The American, who won four Olympic gold medals in Atlanta in 1996 and now regularly won a T.I.S.A., is closed after the attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "I've had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't move.
The doctor said, "I can tell you how much I can heal."
It was very hard work, but now I've learned to move, and I've started bodywork again today!
Thank you for the inspiring message!"
The TV is distributed over the TV than on the TV by the mother and the dog
A silent pump organization divided the Internet's opinion into an advertisement to compare children's mothers to milk cows.
What is called "the world's first soundless tin pump," is a funny music video released by the spokesperson of the technology organization Elvi to show the freedom that the new pump gives to modern mothers.
The four true mothers are dancing with a song full of fat, which includes, "Yes, I'm drinking my own milk, but I don't have my leg" and "If anyone sees it, it's no animal, it's my dog."
Corus continues: "Puff up, pump up, feed the kids, pump up, I'll drink my girlfriend's milk."
Although, the advertisement, which has been released on the company's Facebook page, has raised an online debate.
77,000 views and show comments have mixed the video with viewers, and many have said it highlights the "fear" of sweet art.
"It is a very bad decision to use cows in the advertisement.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and give birth to children, it's different that their children are being stolen from them within a few days of birth," one writes.

Another commented: "It seems to be frustrating for both mother and child.
But why would they not be used in the breast pump advertisements for those mothers who keep them healthy?"
Others say, "A lot of unsatisfied advertising."
Others have stood by the announcement, a woman admits that the song has become her "rejoicing".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I ate the baby milk, I would do it too.
When pumping, it's as bad as it is.
The advertisement's kind of crazy, but I'm good at it.
It's a real reason," wrote one.
Another commented: "It is a rustic advertisement that he targets mothers who pump (sometimes at their workplace or in the toilet) and call themselves "grapes".
This advertisement doesn't bring praise or criticism to the art of the Dari. "
At the end of the video, a group of women say they all danced with their brother's hidden pump.
The advertisement is based on the idea that many women feel like pigs when pumping.
Although the LV pump is completely soundless, it doesn't have a tube or tube and fits well in the nursing bridge, which also allows women to move in during the pumping, keep children in school, and even free to go outside.
Anna Balorin, a partner of Mother and C.D., said: "Lvi pump should be a multiplicative product that should be started bravely and aggressively.
By drawing parallel images of women and women in the South Sea, we want to capture the silence pumping and all its challenges, revealing in a fun and relevant way the new pump will feel incredible about the release.
Elvi pump didn't take the first news.

Several immigrant children were taken to a camp on a quiet Texas border
The number of immigrant children is increasing, although the monthly border crossing is relatively unaffected, because the difficult rules and policies of the Trump administration make it more difficult to keep children at home.
Traditionally, the majority of Spins are threatening to lose the opportunity to live in their own country without having to report the demands of immigrants and children.
The risks increase in June when federal authorities announce that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families will have to collect fingerprints and share the information with the immigration authorities.
Last week, a former officer of immigration and shulk has testified before Matthew Albens Congress, that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied for the sponsorship of orphans children.
The agency later reported that 70 percent of those arrested had no history of crime.
"Some 80 percent of the family members of the sponsors or sponsors are illegal in the country, and most of them are violent criminals.
So we are continuing to search them," Nister Albens says.
In an effort to bring the children back to society faster, officials have introduced some new rules, including a month of arrest, to be brought to court, which was 60 days ago.
Many people will not come to the immigration judge personally when their case is due to come through the video conference call.
Those who are considered unworthy of salvation will be quickly released.
According to security workers and in recent months, according to reports published by the system, children are more likely to be alarmed or disappointed, which could lead to an attempt to escape or to escape.
Supporters say this concern is more intense in the centre than in Turnillo, where children are more concerned, more likely to be ignored, more likely to be ignored.
They also said that if children are not mentally prepared or lost enough time to move away from the center, many may be able to increase the number of times they already have.
The U.S., France, and Turkey have been forced to leave Syria immediately.
The U.N. welcomes the general appeal, Foreign Minister Valid-Al-Moalem called for the return of refugees to Syria, although the country has been fighting for eight years.
Moylem, who is also the deputy prime minister of the country, says that foreign forces are in the country's land, and "We will take appropriate measures to fight terrorism."
"They have to leave now without condition," he says to the newspaper.
Moylem insists that Syria "has almost ended the war against terrorism", where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He says Damascus will continue the war "until all Syrian territories are cleared" against terrorists and "unlawful foreign presence".
There are nearly 2,000 US troops in Syria, the Kurdish army against President Bashar-Al-Assad and the Syrian Arab for primary education and advice.
There are more than 1,000 French troops in this war-stricken country.
On the refugee question, Moylem says that the situation is suitable for their return and he blames "a few Western countries" for "disposal of fear" that has announced to refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and human organisations to help this return," he said.
"They're political about the whole human problem."
The US and the European Union have stressed that Syria will not be helped to complete the war between Assad and the opponents until the political agreement is reached.
The UN co-sponsors said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to build a buffer zone in the final major rebellion in the Devil has provided an opportunity to move forward through political discussion.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented a major attack by Russian troops in the region, where three million people live.
But Moylem insists that the agreement has "a clear deadline" and he hopes that this military action, Al-Qaeda-related Nussers, will work against the fighting of the front, whose "will be settled."
The U.S. Army Angel Stefan De Mistura has been expecting to call for a new committee meeting on government and opposition members to prepare draft war-constitutions and open the way for elections.
Moylem pointed out the status of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the panel's work should be limited to "to review the paragraphs of the current constitution", and he warned against unnecessary action.
Win the Keno Tromp on the second side
In this argument, the re-election of the Tromp 2020 will be successful, as many liberals hope that his presidential position will soon end due to the curse and the calendar.
Which, of course, will be "the most dramatic end of any president!"
Until now, there's no sign of changing viewers' opinions.
Since 2014, CNN has also increased by nearly 1.05 million over prime time ratings and by nearly 1.6 million for MNBCs.

He's asking questions.

In the middle of the election, money goes like a flood.
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th vote is flying, as two candidates are fighting for the same approach to the return of the Congressal District.
The recently re-established city of Pittsburgh District Pitts brought the Democratic Representative to the battle of Conr Lamb - who has won another district in a special election in the past.
Lamb fights the Republican Keith Rothfas, who is currently representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, many of which are part of the 17th district.
In January, Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old districts were constitutionally organized against the Republicans and that the map had been redesigned.
This election of the 17th District was part of a campaign to raise funds between the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCC).
In March, the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania won the Lamb's contact only after the election of the special election.
For over a decade, this approach was in the right of the Republicans, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Politicians continue to hold on to democrats.
To support the U.S. China, El Salvador was forced to return to the Great Panda.
Cottellers noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, leaving Washington a little behind.
Mr. Tromp Panama's president, Juan Carlos Verler, met a warm meeting in June 2017 and also had a hotel in Panama, but later the participants removed the leader of the tromp organization.
In a statement on Wednesday this month, the head of the foreign department, Hydar North, said that officials of the opposition, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama, decided to return to the leaders of the U.S. diplomatic mission with regard to Taiwan's "recognition of non-recognition".
However, only El Salvador was declared punishable, who received nearly $140 million as a rescue in 2017 in drug control, development and financial aid.
The proposed penalty, including the closure of financial aid and a specific visa ban, could be painful for the country in Central America because of its high unemployment and loss of life.
With the progress of the internal meeting, North American and Central American officials have suspended a high-level meeting to prevent migrants from spreading to America last year.
But in mid-September, Nagad, the senior officials of the administration, explained that they wanted to hold a conference, which effectively put an end to El Salvador's sentence.
The co-sponsors announced that the vice president, Mr. Mike Pens, will give a speech at the conference, which was scheduled in mid-October to give a message to the administration of import.
And in three countries, the American angels returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic in silence with no strong message or punishment from Washington.
Mr. Bolton did not want to comment on the statement made by the three members of the U.S. party to the internal debate on the lack of a spokesperson for the White House.
An external analyst confirmed the closeness of their speech administration and refused to publish the name.
Read history
The next emergency may be the special report of Robert Mullar, which now has sufficient evidence in the public record, about the possible ban on Mr. Tromp.
During the election, Mr. Tramp's investigation of Mr. Mullar has been reported to be turning around.
If Congress is changed, Mr. Tromp must take responsibility, just as he is preparing to go back to the voters and may have to go back to the jury with his colleagues to the end.
There are many things about it, and I don't want to say that Mr. Tromp's fall is possible, or his European supplement.
How long this opposition will last will be a part of the preference of the two Indians.

We have failed, and we have been able to avoid killing for many years.
The course of history often takes such a turn, and it sometimes pushes away, sometimes delayed, the unpredictable rate of democracy.
Such a trend has occurred in America's history.
What should we do if Mr. Tromp's Deep Atrne General Rod Rosenstein is to be found to determine the fate of Mr. Muller's investigation.
Since it was published in the past year, Rosenstein has been in trouble that he recommended recording the president in secret and considered his inability to do so.
Mr. Rogenstein says the news of the Times is invalid.
"What will be our impact if the F.B.I. investigation is incomplete or unjust if we begin to justify the Bret Cavanf - or even if he is innocent in the Supreme Court despite a credible charge of sexual harassment and false testimony?
The biggest question is, will we elect a congress in the middle of the election that will be able to blame Mr. Tromp?
If we fail this test, democracy will go to cold for long days.

The rangers were hopeful before the battle of Pied Vienne by Dorans
On Thursday, Rangers will play with their own apps, and in the beginning of the summer, in Spain, they will be able to compete against the British after a great deal of dreary, from the G Group of their European League.
The first match in the Middlefield game of Dorans Moosum was played at the 2-2 rounds in the game with Villarial, but he believes that it will be possible for them to get to the right place with the result.
"This point is very important, because Villarial is a good group," says a 31-year-old.
"We took refuge and took off a point.
I could finally win, but in general, Dr. Tai felt the right result.

Despite the idea of how participants in the review should do this, very few people have talked to their family members about it.
Half of the participants in the NationWaid review said they talked to their husband or wife about the long-term service costs.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to think about them, but they're not taking steps to talk about it," says President Holly Snyder of Bimba's life.
You know where to start.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: If you do not express your wishes well enough, you will not be able to prepare your family for your ministry.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you want to accept it, because the determination of your preferences is also very important.
Talk to your financial advisor: Your advisor can look for solutions to these costs.
The long-term service policy may include a long-term long-term service policy, if you have any meaning - a hybrid life-priority policy can be self-employed to help these costs.
Resolve your incoming documents: try to stay away from the war.
Choose a proper health care proxy so you can select someone who is a faithful person for your research and that you can't contact them so that they can follow your wishes.
And, keep track of the fact that you're going to get one on your property.
Select a trusted person to make your financial decisions and make sure that you are unable to make your payments correctly.
Don't forget about it: You think your elderly parent needs some urgent treatment and is being taken to hospital.
Are you alert to her allergies and current medications?
Put all of this into a written plan so you can stay in it.

Federal Councillors are seeking death penalty for suspecting terrorist attacks in New York
New York's Federal Consulsulra seeks death penalty for Sifoulo Siepov, a suspect involved in a terrorist attack in New York to kill eight people who were not sentenced to death after 1953.
There is a charge that a 30-year-old Cypov used a home depot wheeled truck in Loar Manhattan to attack the West Side Hayway bicycles in October, so that the bikers and drivers can go back.
In order to carry out the death penalty in New York's South District, students must prove that the Cyprus "willfully" killed eight people and "willfully" seriously injured them.
According to the court's documents, both of them are sufficient to execute the death penalty.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury brought 22 charges against Siepov, including eight charges of murder, which are usually committed in the area of organised crime, with charges of violence and car destruction.
As Cyprus points out, as the attack of "violent, cruel and corrupt" has occurred, Kässulier says that "a proper plan and direction" is needed.
"Syflo Habillav Sippov, whose families and friends are injured, injured and injured by Digo Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Clavez, An-Lora Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erleiz, Harnan Feruschi, Harnan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Mendoza," Int State notes.
Five of the victims were sightseeing from Argentina.
New York South District was the last to be executed a decade ago.
Asami Khalid Burns was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but he was sentenced to life imprisonment by the end of September 2009.
Last time in a New York federal case, the death penalty was imposed in 1953 against a married couple named Julius and Ethel Rozenberg, who were accused of conspiracy in the Soviet Union two years ago during the Cold War.
Both of Rozenburg's couples were put to death on June 19, 1953.
The resident of Uzbekistan, Siepov, has not shown any sympathy, reports the court.
The police said he was happy after the incident.
Sipov told the officials that he was inspired by the video of the I.S.S. on the phone at home, and was accused.
The police said he also asked for an I.S.S. flag to be placed at his hospital's house.
He claimed to be innocent of this 22 charges.
David Patton of the Federal Public Defenders representing Cyprus says that in this decision, Kuzsul is "evidently disappointed".
Patton says, "We think that the trial will lengthen the trial of each of us, in the search for a death sentence, rather than demanding a life sentence."
Sipov's legal team has already called for the death penalty for Kässuli.
Sansad Tori says Nigel Farez should be given the responsibility of a brief review.
Nigel Farez today promises to "consolidate the crowd" at the Tory's conference.
This former Wikipedia leader says that politicians have 'scouted from Eurosceptics' - when Thessa May's own MP says he should be given the responsibility to discuss with the U.S.
Konzarvetive leader Peter Burmingham's meeting said that if Mr. Farez Brexit had been secretary, the United Kingdom would already have come to the U.S.
However, Mrs. May was once again clear to keep her deeply divided leaders in one place, when she took part in another Brexit protest in the city of Toris.
Amongst other things, this Brexit-supported Brexit-Related and E-U attack is driving the chechers contract right in the middle of the attack.
Her colleagues insisted that, despite the opposition, Brazil should be forced to make a deal with them – and that Europeanseptics and Lebar should choose a choice between their packages and their 'distortion'.
Mr. Solihale said at the Live Mins Live meeting that he wanted 'Chuck Chess'.
He suggested that Mr. Farez should be co-worked and that he should be responsible for the discussion with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we'd go outside," he says.
Weelinboro's MP says, "I'll support Brexit, but I need a job cheque."
She says to her opponents: "We have not fought the world to survive
We want to make our own laws in our own country .
After the 2016 vote, Mr. Sister has been able to change the opinion of the public. "British people want to change their opinion in the U.S. - the idea is completely wrong."
Tori Brexit, a supporter of Andre Jenkins, also attended the meeting, which told reporters: ‘I just want to say this: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Cecurs will not vote for the hatreds of the general public, the opponents will not vote for it, and it is also the hatreds of our group and the active workers who have brought us here.
Move the hammers and try to hear the speech.'
He added to Mrs. Me's language: "The Prime Minister is thinking about where his promise should be fulfilled."
At Mr. Farez's meeting, politicians should be forced to recognize the "distortion situation" if they are to be unfaithful to the 2016 vote's decision.
“It is now a matter of faith among politicians,” he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit, and we'll tell them, 'If we do, we won't let you escape.'
He added: "I want politicians who are trying to cheat on Brexit to face up to the situation.
"We're running the crowd that won our Brexit, and we won't rest until we're a free, independent, proud United Kingdom."
Among these, the Brexit-Residents held a two-hour meeting with the city centre in Burma.
After a group of workers were formed at the end of this week, Brexit banners were displayed against the Tori.
The leader of the Leber Party at the Adonis Assembly, after a security problem at a party app, ridiculed the Conzervets.

"It's a whole thing.
It's not like a good brexit, he says anything else.
The president is thinking of giving Warren a hard look at the application.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would be deeply concerned about the presidential application after the vote in November.
Boston Globe reports that this Massachusetts Democrat, a town in the West Massachusetts, has said this about its future in the course of its journey.
Warren, who often criticizes the President's Tromp, fought with G and P State candidate Jeff Dale in the November re-election, who was co-sponsored for the campaign in the country's Massachusetts in 2016.
He is currently discussing that he can compete with the Tromp in the 2020 election.
The 36th meeting with its organizers was held on Saturday evening in Holio on Saturday evening.
A participant asks him to be an applicant in the presidency.
The time has come for Warren to take the government that we read in this section under the leadership of a woman.
The arrest of L.S.U.'s Sims on the murder.
Baton Rouz, L.A. Police said a suspect was arrested on Friday, L.S.A. basketball player Wade Sims was shot and killed.
20-year-old Diton Simpson was arrested at 11 a.m. and reported the Baton Rouge Police Department, which is the news conference.
They posted a video of a shooting event on Friday, asking to mark the person.
20-year-old Sims was shot at the Saudi University camp on Friday.
Police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media that "the shooting of Wade Sims killed him," reports 247ports.
Wade went to rescue his friend and hit Simpson's hand.
Simpson was arrested and admitted to living on the scene, he had weapons, and he also admitted to shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested immediately, and the East Baton Rose Paris Police Department took him to arrest.
The baton rose 6 feet 6 junior highs, played 10th of March and played 32th in last month, which is 17.4 minutes each match, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Luis Hamilton, a member of the Service Bethel team, went further to the world market to win.
It was clear when Saturday the Valtery botas Luis Hamilton was given the qualifications and said that the Marsidez team would play an important role in this race.
From Paul, the Bots are well-initiated to ignore Hamilton and to keep the first two on the left and invite the veteran to attack his team player.
Leave Vettel Hamilton behind the veil and go into the pit yourself, which could be a designer.
The Marcides driver picks up his lap and comes after the vet, but Hamilton goes on after the war, to show that the ferry driver is double-moved and uninvited to empty the inside with the danger of being able to hold hands.
Max Verstampen started his 21st birthday in the back row and was number seven after the first lap.
Then he takes a lot of the race first, and then he takes the bad tires back and takes the fourth place.
He's on the 44th lap, but he couldn't get the rest of the eight laps anymore, so he's gone to the fourth place.
It was a difficult day because Valteri fought all week and worked like a real gentleman.
The group is doing a great job first," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
At a meeting held on Saturday, President Donald Tramp, Senator Dean Finstein, who was accused of sexual assault against the Supreme Court's Bret Cavanf.
Instead of speaking directly at a meeting in West Virginia, the president said that people's "low and powerful and false" mentality is reflected in what is going on in the scene.
"It's something that could happen and the beautiful thing that's been going on in the cinema for the past few weeks, you'll see anger when you see low and powerful and false people," he said.
"When they see the information empty, they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
Oh, I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Finnstein, are you out of your mind?
Remember his answer... did you dump the document-- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I did not make the mistake."
Hey, wait a minute.
We've lost... no, we didn't," he says, copying the senator.
In July, this letter was sent to Ford Finnstein, with a description of the complaints against Cavanf, and the letter went bankrupt in September – but Finnstein refused to leave his office.
"I didn't blame Dr. Ford's complaints, I didn't make any fuss," The Hill reports to the Finnish Committee.
"He told me to keep it secret, and I kept it secret according to his word."
But he was not the president's guest, and at Saturday night's meeting, he said, "What I'm saying is that it was a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but I never saw any worse language than that."
Three women spoke out against the Supreme Court, accused of sexual misconduct, the president said that Democrats were using complaints for their own purpose.
"They want power back at any cost.
Look at low mentality, see virtue, don't force them to hurt, don't force anyone to change their powers and control," the president said in Morm.

Air traffic controllers confirmed the survival of hundreds of birds from the earth in exchange for their lives
An Indonesian air traffic controller, who is on his way to help fly the plane with more than a century of traffic controllers, is worthy of his death.
More than 800 people died on the island of Sulawesi on Friday because of a large earthquake and many people are missing.
The next group, Joralo, repeatedly climbs the ground and the people are trapped in the flames of destruction.
But even when all the co-workers fled, 21-year-old Antonios Gunawan Palur Mutiyara did not escape the terrible control of Cis Al-Zouferi Airport.
He confirmed that the Battle Air Flight 6321, which was then in Ranway, could fly safely.
Then, afraid of breaking the control tower, he slams down.
Then he died in the hospital.
The president of Indonesia Air Navigation, Johannes Siriet, said that his decision saved the lives of some people, reports the Australian ABC News.
We set up a helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to another hospital.
Unfortunately, this morning, the helicopter died before it arrived.
"Our hearts are broken by this news," he added.
Already, the agency said that the number of deaths that the authorities fear may be thousands apart, says that the contact between Dongala, Sigi and Botong has been limited.
"It is believed that the number of deaths is increasing, because there are arrests under the destruction of many bodies that have not yet been reached," said the agency's spokesman, Puroyo Nugroho.
A six-metre high roof leads to the destruction of oil where the mass of graves will be managed on Sunday.
The military and commercial aircraft are providing rescue and assistance.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, says to Sky News: "A minute and a minute, Ambulance is coming. "A minute, Ambulance is coming.
You can't get clean water.
Small shops everywhere have been robbed."
Jan Galfand CNN, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, says: "Indonesian Red Cross is moving quickly to help the living, but we don't know what we're going to see there.
It is already sad, but the situation may be worse."
President Joko Widodo from Indonesia said to the country's army members on Sunday: "I ask you to stay in your day-to-night rescue work.
Are you ready?" CNN's report.
In the beginning of this year, Indonesia's long habitat has become more than 550 habitats.
Micronesian plane crash: The plane Newgini reported missing in the plane plane crash
When one of the airlines crashed into the Pacific Legion of Micronesia, they had previously reported that 47 passengers and workers were rescued from the dunes, and now they are aware that there is one missing.
Air Neugini says in a report on Saturday Bickel that a man does not find a traveler.
The airline reported that they are working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers.
Airline immediately refused to provide detailed information like the age and nationality of the journey.
After trying to get to the Cook Island Airport, the plane crashed into the water and helped to rescue some local ships and workers.
Officials announced Friday that seven were taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers are in the hospital on Saturday, and they're all in stable condition.
There's still nothing clear about why this incident happened.
Airline and U.S. Navy both said that the plane was landing before arriving in Ranway.
A number of witnesses thought the plane was on the run.
American passenger Bill Jens says the plane went down very low.
"That's a very good thing," says Jens.
Jens says he and others have reached the airport in the middle of the river.
He says the air workers screamed in terror and he has a little crush on his head.
U.S. Navy reports that near a jet is helping to rescue crews who are engaged in the operation of Syria, and they take the aircraft 30 meters (100 feet) to the water before they sink through a full-fledged ship.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people were killed on the PNG-registered airline in the last two decades, but there was no accident in the aircraft.
Analysts have been able to take the time to burn the woman alive.
In 2014 the prosecution case was filed on Saturday at the prosecution trial of a woman who was accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi.
U.S. Judicial Analyst Paul Roolette has witnessed several hours as an expert in research.
He describes how he uses the phone record to create a 29-year-old Asian Quenton Teles and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Roolet says he saves some cell phone information, which indicates that Teles and Chambers were together on the evening of death, which was the report of Clarion Lazer against Teles before.
It is reported that at the time, his cell phone was with Chambers, although he claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke with Sanford.
Sanford says he wasn't in town at night with witnesses on Saturday.
When the councillors ask whether Teles is telling the truth that he was on Sanford's truck that night, Sanford answers that "it's a lie, because his truck was in Nashville that night."
Another complaint is that Teles said he knew him two weeks before Chambers died.
The phone record says they've only known each other for a week.
Roolette says that shortly after the death of Chambers, Teleis deletes text, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He's done away with life," Haley says.
The case's final argument was filed on Sunday.
The judge says the case is expected to go to the jury the next day.
The High Brad: What's Consass Hip Hop?
By giving a positive message in a hip-hop third song, this series wants to challenge the negative idea of this series.
Bristol's The High Breed claims that Hiep Hop has moved away from the source of his political message and social problems.
They want to go back to their main stream, and they want to re-populate the Consass hip.
The Fusions and the Commons have recently seen the resurrection through artists like Akala and people in the United Kingdom.
Another farmer?
New York Nani filed a complaint against a couple after the "individual" text.
A mother is making a case against a young woman in New York to be called "Arkejen Farmanang" for a controversial text from a mother.
He rejected the complaint as a double-segregator and sought a case against "Julum".
The mother of two children, Linci Plasco-Falksman, expressed disappointment at the first day of work in 2016 that Gigel Morris was a farmer who was a new observer for the children.
Ms. Plasco-Falxman writes to her husband "NaAA another farm" text message.
Anyway, she sent it to Miss Morris twice instead of sending it to her husband.
She later realized that the "indiscriminate" Plasco-Falxman published Ms. Morris, who said that their previous African-American Nanny, because of his bad work, was expecting a Filipino, the report of the New York Post.
Miss Morris was given one day and then sent home.
Maurice is now indicting for damages against the couple's divorce and is demanding a daily allowance of $350 for six months, although she was first hired as a nurse in the house without any contract.
"I want to show them, look, I can't do that," he told the post on Friday, and he added, "I know it's different and more competitive."
The couple objected to their claim that it was reasonable to expel Morris, fearing that he could not be trusted after being accused.
"My wife didn't want to say what she sent.
He's not a characterist.
We're not a characterist couple," says Joel Plasco Post.
"But will you leave your children in the hands of someone with whom you have misused, even if it has been wrong?
Your noble child?
Say it."
Plasko said that his wife had only born two months ago and was in “a very difficult situation”.
"Do you want to go against someone like that?
It's not a very good thing to do this," the banker said.
In the context of the case, the social media of the Court of Justice strongly condemns the couple's behaviour and arguments.
Padington's publication expressed fears that readers might not be able to communicate with a loved one, published in a new letter.
Band's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to say before the publication what will be the first time it will be felt.
It's a funny thing to know after the great success of Padington.
His father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by the children's book from a small game, said that he was hopeful of rejecting his work, and he added that after his death last year, he had the 60th anniversary of the book's publication.
Padington, whom he described as "the most important member of our family", says that his father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a quiet man, and he wasn't an idiot," he said.
"Then Padington was so real to him that your child made a success of it: you're proud of him, even though you have no role in it.
I think he saw the success of Padington that way.
Although it was his own creation and imagination, he always thanked Padington himself.
My daughter was on the road to death, and I had to tell her to stop by the phone.
Soon after the drop, his daughter was taken to the hospital, Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nade called regularly saying it's too bad, and she won't survive," says Mrs. Ednan-Laperoz.
"Then I get the Nada's phone and I know she'll die in two minutes and I was forced to tell her by the phone.
And that's what I do.
I say, "Tashi, Darling I love you very much.
I'll come to you soon.
I'll come to you.
The doctors slowly stopped working on her body and left the body.
He died a little while ago and then everything stopped.
There was no way but to wait for me, you know.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was involved in family and people.
I had to hold on to myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Lapéroz, then expressed regret at the death of her daughter, who was on the other side of the plane - she was different for this difficult situation.
No one knew," he said.
"I had my head down, and my eyes had been filled with water.
It's impossible to describe it, but I was in the middle of the flight with the necessary Nada equipment.
That he needs my love and compassion.
I know how good he was.
Sadard posted a card to stop suicide at the woman's grave.
Two women who lost their loved ones in suicide work to stop the killing of others.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfris Welsh Bridge post cards and phone numbers where people can call for help.
Miss Davis' son has been depressed since he was 13 years old and has committed suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I represent," he said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Lidney, says that his son was a promising boss and had a violent laugh.
"Everyone knows him for his laugh.
Everyone said the house was shining in his smile."
Anyway, he quit his job before he died because he "was really gone into the dark."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, was found dead.
Ms. Davis says, "I'm constantly worried that this effort will end."
Ms. Davis made a card, "There are people you can talk to, and they can be friends.
Don't sit down quietly - you need to talk.
Miss Hamfris, who lost his 15-year-old partner, Miss Davis for many years after his mother died.
"He never said that his heart was bad or he was poisoned or something," he said.
"I noticed some changes in the use of it two days before Christmas.
"On Christmas Day, he was in a bad mood - the kids didn't even look at him when he opened their gift."
He said that his death had a major mental injury to them, but it had to be cut: "It created a large space in the family.
We've been separated.
But we have to go and fight."

Bret Cavanf's future question to begin his investigation of F.B.I.
"I thought that if we could give something that he wanted - because the time of the investigation is limited, the opportunity is limited - we could probably bring something together," said Mr. Flake Saturday, and he added that he fears that the committee might "fall apart" in the face of this bias.
What did Mr. Kavanf and his Republican supporters not want to investigate F.B.I.?
It's about their duty time.
On 6 November, only five weeks left of the mid-election - if the Republicans were, in hopes, bad results, their efforts to find people who like the country's highest court will become very weak.
George Dublow is calling the Bush Senators and is investigating Mr. Kavanf, working under Mr. Bush's White House, to support Mr. Bush, through whom Mr. Bush is familiar with his wife, Assil, who was the personal saviour of Mr. Bush.
What will happen after the F.B.I. report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear if Mr. Kavanf can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, so that he can be assured in the Supreme Court by the vice president, Mike Pens Tai.
The number of North Koreans left under Kim is "low"
Seven years ago, after Kim Jong-un was given power, the number of North Korea's parties dropped, a South Korean law enforcement officer said that.
Park Beong-seg, quoted the South Korean Integration Ministry as saying that last year there were 1,127, which was 2,706.
Mr. Park says that the main reason for demanding hard-limits between North Korea and China's control and the wealth of human offenders is that they are in need of more money.
Piayyong has not made any public comments.
A large number of refugees from North Korea have been granted citizenship in South Korea.
Sun reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most of them are Chinese, with the longest border with North Korea, and it's easier than crossing the highly protected zone (DMJ) between two Koreas.
China considers these refugees not as refugees, but as illegal immigrants, and often pushes them back to their countries.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are still in war - have been significantly improved in recent months.
In the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met to discuss Pyongyang, the centre of which was the nuclear disarmament of the Tham.
This was followed by a historic meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jung-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work together to create a nuclear weapon-free Korean island.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ree Yong-ho blames the US ban for advancing.
In a speech given in the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Mr. Ree said, "If there is no confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in national security and in such a situation we will not disarm ourselves in any way first."
Nancy Pelosi Brett Kavanf called "Histeria-Grest" saying he is unable to perform his duties in the Supreme Court.
The little leader of the house Nancy Pelosi Supreme Court called Bret Cavanoff "Histeria-Gresto" and said that he was normally in charge of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi Saturday Austin, Texas, commented on this at a meeting at Texas Tribune Festival.
He said about his reaction to the testimony of the Cavanf in front of the Senate Jewish committee on Thursday, "I couldn't imagine that if any woman had ever done such a thing, she would be called "histeria-grass."
He denied the complaint with Kavanf Strong that he had sex with Dr. Christine Blazi when they were both teenagers.
Kavanf was moved to talk about his family and high school life, and he stopped breathing.
He clearly denounced the Democrats in the committee and accused them of being a "democratic and interlocutory character" that was done in the 2016 presidential election of Hillary Clinton.
Palosy says he believes that the witness of Kavanf is not worthy of the Supreme Court, because it has proved that he is guilty against the Democrats.
"I think he has proved himself unworthy of the statement he has made and how he has raised Clinton and Democrats," he says.
When he was asked if he would curse him if he was certain of the Kavanf and the Democrats had won the majority in the house, Pelosy expressed regret.
"I'll say that -- if he doesn't really tell Congress or FB I, he's not only entitled to the Supreme Court, but he's also not entitled to the Court," says Pelosy.
Kavanf is currently the judge of DC's Circuit Court of Apples.
Pelosy adds that, as a Democrat, he is concerned that Kavanf Afordebol will oppose the act of Cair or Ro V. Wade, because he is a conjurative justice.
In hearing her confirmation, Kavanf has avoided the question of whether he will change some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It can't be said that the hysteria-grass, the defendant, will go to court and tell us, 'It's not great,' says Pelosy.
And women should control it.
It's a fair debate, month and year after year, and she can't cry.
"If we're angry, cry," Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's cool, what do you say?"
He also says, "A woman in charge helped me a lot, who said that she was angry too, but she chose the right that when she started to cry, she would say to the one she was talking to, "You may think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm really mad."
Then he continued.
I thought it was amazing."
Azru works in part as an expression of anger, because they are mainly a victim of misunderstanding.
One of my first-hand memories of a job, a man-in-chief office, where I once saw myself crying in disbelief, an old woman took my scarf - that was a bad manager - I always feared him a little - who took me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sorry, and they'll be happy to see you."
Patrick Schroeder, then Colorado Democratic Congressman, worked with him at the election of the president of Gary Hart.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a boat in the country about marriage and went out of the competition for dirty work, Miss Schroeder felt deeply disappointed that his president had no reason not to be an applicant.
"It wasn't a very deliberate decision," he said in laughter 30 years later.
"There are already seven other candidates in the fight, and no one else wants to.
One of them said, "Sno white and seven left."
He was late in the campaign and promised that he would not run for 2 million dollars without it.
It was a war of defeat.
He saw that a supporter was only paid $250 if a man was given $1,000.
"Do they think I'll get the price?" he said surprisedly.
When he announces that he is not carrying out an official campaign, he is deeply moved by his feelings and thanks to his supporters, he is struggling to collect money because of disappointments over the system, he targets the voters with the exception of the representatives, and he becomes ill with anger about sex.
"You might think that I've had a change of heart," Miss Schroeder recalled the effects of the news.
"You might think that Clinex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember, I thought, where would they bury me?
"He didn't cry?"
How this trade war in the United States can go to Beijing
The first summit of this trade war in the United States of China was collapsible, and when at the end of the war, the two countries' struggle could benefit for a long time, like experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump, this year's solar panel, spout, and aluminum, is the first to warn China's major elephants.
The most significant response this week, when the total import price from China is about half the amount of about $200 billion (150 billion pounds), is put in new shells.
As in Beijing every time, they have recently raised between five and ten percent of the U.S. dollars.
China has decided to keep an eye on the war, and the world's second largest has no chance of taking a close look at this economy.
Taking back Washington's claim, China's president Shi Jinping would be very embarrassing for the public.
However, experts say that if Beijing can play cards correctly, the pressure of the US trade war between the two economies can reduce dependence and help China in the long run.
"Any quick political decision by Washington or Beijing can create a situation of economic decline in both countries that is far more dangerous than the idea of Washington Mahal," says Abigail Grace, a co-sponsor of the Center for New American Security, who is practicing with Asia.
Syria said 'prepared' to return to its refugees, Foreign Minister.
Syria said that the country was ready to return to the refugees, and they urged the war-torn country to be rebuilt for seven years.
While the United Nations is giving talks in general, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Moalem says the country is improving.
"Because of the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism today, the situation is stable and secure," he says.
The government has continued its recovery to bring normal conditions back to the areas destroyed by terrorists.
Because of terrorism and the economic situation of the country, living daily and taking care of the food is now acceptable to people who are forced to leave the country.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million have fled Syria since the beginning of the war in 2011.
6 million people left the country need human assistance.
Al-Moualem says the Syrian government welcomes all help to rebuild the country.
However, he also strongly states that no state aid will be accepted or that no aid will be taken from the country supporting the rebels.
The victorious Europe of Paris Rider Cup
Team Europe in France, outside Paris, has won the 2018 Rider Cup with a final score of 16.5-10.5 in Golf National.
The U.S. was defeated in six European soils, and after 1993 they won no more rider hats.
Team Europe, led by Danish Prime Minister Thomas Bianns, has reached 14.5 points and regains the headlines needed to defeat the US.
The American star Phil Michelson, who was unable to play well during most of the tournaments, died in the water at 3 p. 16th floor, and lost to Francesco Molinary.
The Italian golf mollinary, showing all rounds of brilliant performances in 1979, is one of the only 1 scored on 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Speth, the lowest-ranking player in the European team, passed to Thorbjørn Olsen in Denmark on 5 and 4.
The world's leading player, Dustin Johnson 2 and 1 lost to the English Yan Polter, who probably played his last rider hat.
The best-known winner in Europe is Sergio Garsia, Spain, with 25.5 points of career.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't do it right now.
It's been a very bad year.
Thanks to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy to get the hat back.
This is the success of the group, I'm glad I've been able to help," Garcia said in a European voice.
He gives responsibility to Ram his country, who lost US Legend Golfer Woods on Sundays Singles 2 and 1.
"I'm too proud to lose Tiger Woods, I've grown up to see him," 23-year-old John Am says.
Woods lost his four matches in France, and his record on the Rider's hat stood 13-21-3.
For the best players in the world, it's the Bemanan statistics, which only won 14 major prizes after Jack Niklaus.
High-quality Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnau have been on holiday all week.
U.S. Prime Minister Jim Furick said after his group's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of them, they've fought.
This morning, we put a little pressure on Europe.
We couldn't.
Congratulations, Thomas.
He's a good president.
All 12 players have played very well.
"Let's go back, I'll work with the U.S. P.G. and the Ride Cap Committee and move on.
I love these 12 people and I'm proud to be their leader.
You have to respect them.
We're not in the game."
Red Stream Update: The density of pines, manata, and sarasotata decreases
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission has seen a recent decline in the temperature of red currents in the area of the Tampa subspecies.
According to the F.D.C., the situation of the Pachier Blum in the region of Penels, Manata, Sarasota, Charlotte and the county of Colliar has been seen - which is a low-density area.
Blue from the Red Stream from North Pinelas to South Li County with a total of 130 miles.
Hilsboro County can be seen nearly 10 miles away, but it's less visible than last week.
