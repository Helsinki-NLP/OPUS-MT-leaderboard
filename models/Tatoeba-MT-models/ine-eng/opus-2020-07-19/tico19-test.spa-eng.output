How much more or less does he have these symptoms?
and the chest pain should always be treated in this way, especially at its age
and also fever
and must also control your cholesterol and blood pressure
And he's got fever now?
And do you feel this chest pain now?
and also has difficulty breathing
And can you tell me what other symptoms you have besides this one?
and how much has he had of fever
and I also have toss
and I have a little cold and cough.
And today I really have a pretty strong chest pain
and this is the time indicated for your allergy to pollen
and the chest pain appears
And I think I have some fever.
And I want to describe where the chest pain feels.
And they're having some fever, too.
and with its history of diabetes
And you know, I feel like my chest is shaking.
And, you know, people take me over all the time
and feel chest pain
and said it's a pressure on your chest.
someone in the family has a heart problem, heart disease, heart attack, high cholesterol, high blood pressure
is there any other symptoms or problem that you notice in addition to your muscle pain?
Are there other sick people like you with the same symptoms in your home?
Do you have any other symptoms?
Do you have any lack of air?
still feels pain in the chest
because this is the flu season
but, moreover, they should not ignore us for the chest pain of heart origin
But now a more important problem is this chest pain
But I have difficulty breathing
But I know a lot of people are putting me on top of it.
But we must always treat chest pain with the highest seriousness
But now you're breathing well, aren't you?
because of this chest pain I completely forgot
It feels like someone's tearing your chest.
still feels like a lack of air
Do they complain of being sick with similar symptoms?
Do you have any other chronic disease, such as high blood pressure or something like that?
Do you have any other disease, chronic medical problems, such as diabetes?
Do you have any lack of air besides chest pain?
Does he have high blood pressure?
Do you have any episodes of lack of air with that?
Do you know what symptoms she had?
See the picture?
Drinks very liquid today
however, I test for diabetes
however, you have quite the same symptoms as mine
How much does it have to do with fever?
How's your blood pressure?
if you still have high fever
if you have a fever of two or more degrees
if you think your symptoms or problems justify a better examination
He gave me the fever yesterday.
I also had a little fever
tube fever yesterday
I have an acute pain here in my chest
I also have some difficulty breathing
I'll send you an image.
Today I have some chest pain
Today I just have a little headache and some fever
in my opinion, it's a flu
in my opinion, it's a bit of a flu
Is it like someone very, very heavy sitting on their chest?
everything began with headache and fever more or less at the same time
I'm sick of the center of my chest
is a pressure like chest pain
It's in my chest.
is in the center of my chest
is in the center of the chest
I feel pain in my chest
I'm really worried about this chest pain.
I want you to tell me how you describe this chest pain
as high blood pressure or diabetes
as just in the center of the chest

Now, Mary, how many days ago you have the symptoms
now he says he's got chest pain
sometimes, I have a little chest pain
Well, there's some other symptom besides this, that's not just the pain
Or someone sitting on his chest?
basically the same, with fever and cough, headache and muscle pain
right in the center of the chest
show me in this image where you feel the pain
Since you have fever
So do you think some of these symptoms might be related to pregnancy?
So your children have some of the same symptoms?
Tell me about your chest pain
the fever is higher for the night

Cumulative incidence of coronary disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronary disease cases (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages according to the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly across all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparation for a wave of patients with COVID-19 who will require medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a conglomerate of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of China reported that the causing agent was a new coronavirus that is now known as coronavirus 2 from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronary disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild disease, i.e. an infection of the respiratory tract with or without pneumonia, and that most are recovered.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves towards a more serious disease that requires hospitalization, while 6% of the remaining cases develop a critical disease that requires intensive care.
Mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examine trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union or the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (RU) and compare them with those in the Province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the RU with that of Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and RU countries
After China, the COVID-19 continued to spread geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as pandemic.
In its edition of 5 March 2020 Eurosurveillance, Spiterie et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe in accordance with the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were registered in France on 24 January 2020, in persons who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been detected in the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (RU), according to which 39 768 cases and 1727 deaths had been recorded between 31 December 2019 and that date, of which 17 750 cases and 1441 deaths had occurred only in Italy.
Collection of the accumulated amount and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), reports of cases of COVID-19 reported in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to examine the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and RU and to compare them with those of Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative incidence of cases of COVID-19 in 14 days; thus, we took into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and RU, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the accumulated number of cases reported in each country as of 15 March 2020, at 8:00 a.m., compared with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA and RU countries
Trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and RU countries generally followed that of the Province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the EU as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase by about 21 February and then significantly increased by 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all the other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed upward trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 similar (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and RU countries, compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It points out that by 15 March at 8:00 a.m., other 15 EU/EEA countries and the RU had already recorded a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the RU.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is moving at a similar pace in all countries.
This is in spite of the different stages in which countries are located, variations in national public health responses, and possibly different definitions in countries and different protocols to select patients to be tested to confirm COVID-19, including delayed tests.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admittances of COVID-19 in a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6 % and 1 % of cases, respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be systematically collected to complement current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010–11 showed a significant variation in the availability of beds of intensive care and intermediate care in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds every 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive care and intermediate care per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
Model scenarios relating to the saturation of medical care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the RU of the prevalence of cases of hospitalization by COVID-19 associated with a risk of >90 % overcapacity of intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since, so far, cases have been conglomerated in certain regions of EU/EEA and RU countries, and hospitals and intensive care units normally provide a defined regional population, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the level of the Nomenclature of statistical territorial units 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly advancing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore be prepared for a sustained community transmission stage of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, as is happening in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the rapid risk assessment of the ECDC, it is essential to adopt a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change in a mitigation approach, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not allow the decision-makers to understand, accept and adapt their response in an agreed manner if it is not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures necessary to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief period of opportunity during which countries have the opportunity to deepen their control efforts to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, it is likely that the health systems of other EU/EEA countries will face a wave of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days and weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (SARS-COV-2), has so far caused the death of 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and other parts of the world, creating a catastrophe for humans.
Similarly to its homologous virus, the SARS-CoV, which caused the SARS in thousands of people in 2003, the SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from the bat and caused similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a severity and mortality lower than SARS, but it is much more transmissible and affects older people than young people and more men than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on emerging disease, the purpose of this article is to provide a timely and comprehensive analysis of the topic of research, which is being developed rapidly.
We will discuss the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions have not yet been answered, we hope that this analysis will help to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival of 25 January 2020 has become an unauditable and unbundling memory for all Chinese, who were urged to stay at home throughout the festival and for several weeks longer due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as Coronavirus (CoV) that caused a outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was called Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly throughout the country and to almost 50 countries more than the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with more than 40,000 patients with high data and more than 3000 patients missing.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number 1" and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) in less than two months, more than 200 scientific articles on COVID-19 have been published, including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of the virus isolated from multiple patients.
The aim of this analysis is to sum up progress in research on this new matter that is being developed rapidly.
When possible, we will try to compare the COVID-19 with the SARS and other diseases caused by a CoV, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, a outbreak in 2012).
We will also consider what is known so far about the prevention and forecasting of the disease, as well as some decisive questions that have not yet been answered.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered nonletal pathogens for humans, mainly causing about 15 % of common colds 4.
However, in this century, we have found ourselves two times with highly pathogenic coronary viruses in humans, i.e. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused a outbreak in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is the third by coronavirus of which it is recorded in the history of mankind.
As shown in Fig. 1,1, conglomerates of unknown origin pneumonia were first reported Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus was revealed.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was registered in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, the infection of medical care providers was reported, suggesting that transmission between humans was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was quarantined and all public transport was suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that only 21 patients with confirmed cases had direct contact with the Wuhan marine market that was considered the source site of the infection of an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the date of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and almost 50 more countries worldwide (fig. 2).
Since the situation is rapidly evolving, the final dimension and severity of the outbreak cannot yet be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly people from 30 to 65 years of age.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 and only 14 were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
The COVID-19 expanded into conglomerates mostly in Hubei and its surroundings.
On average, it would take 5 days (from 2 to 9) between the appearance and diagnosis of the COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95 % CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons increased exponentially before 23 January 2020, which coincides with the period of massive mobilization prior to the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44 % (95 % CI: 1.10-1.86 %), and the overall mortality rate of patients was 3.06 % (95 % CI: 2.02-4.59 %).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large and enveloped viruses containing a single-purpose chain RNA.
They can be divided into four genders, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alphacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus are those that infect humans.
The glucoprotein (S) of the wrapper is attached to its cell receptors, the convertible enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) and the dipeptidedase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and then the membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released to cytoplasm; after the replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, together with the glycoproteins of the envelope and proteins of the nucleocapides, forms vesiculars containing viriones, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-COV-2 was announced on 10 January 2020.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98% in 10 sequence samples taken from the original site of the outbreak: the Huaan Marine Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With an electronic transmission microscope, particles of the SARS-CoV-2 were found in ultradepleted sections of the human respiratory epithelial.
Human ACE2 was determined to be a recipient of SARS-COV-2, as well as SARS-COV.
However, the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 connects to human ACE2 weaker than that of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by the orf3b and a secret protein coded by the orf8.
The SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may have a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, the orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional reason.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the electronic cryomythrocopy structure of the full-length human ACE2 in resolution 2.9 Å, complex with the carrier amino acid B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a domer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could combine two S proteins, which provides evidence for the recognition and infection of the coronary virus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic Diana for the drug study in order to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and intermediate guest
It is known that SARS-COV and MERS-COV originated in mussels and were transmitted to humans by means of shells and camels, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was considered that the mustlegous is the native guest of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is identical in 96% to two coronaviruses similar to the SARS of mustlegs called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown what mid-guest helped the virus cross the barrier of species to infect humans, and the transmission route remains elucidated.
Ji, et al., proposed to snakes as carriers of the virus of musculoskeletal diseases to humans, which involved homologous recombination within the protein S.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolines (long-choic monkeys that are fed with hormones and are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine) are a possible intermediate guest of SARS-CoV-2 based on a genetic homology of 99% in a coronavirus discovered in pangolines and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference of 1 % spread over the whole of two genes remains a big difference; thus, final results are expected to give concrete evidence (fig. 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at less than 20 °C with a humidity of 40-50 %.
SARS-CoV-2 could have similar properties.
Sars-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and to heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at 75 %, a chlorine disinfectant, perchloric acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective in disabling the virus.
The entire human population generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new coronary virus.
No detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been announced so far.
Therefore, we can only use previous studies with other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, after the virus invades the guest, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, type Toll receptors (TLRs), type NOD receptors (NLRs) and type RIG-I receptors (RLRs).
Through various pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the ripening of dendritic cells and the synthesis of Type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophagic phagocysis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus escape from immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response is added to the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defence.
T CD4+ cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and T CD8+ cells directly kill the cells infected with the virus.
Co-operating T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defense cells.
However, coronaviruses can inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing the apoptosis of T cells.
Humor immunity, which includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, the isolated antibodies of a recovered patient neutralized the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exaggerated reaction of the immune system locally generates a large number of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, multi-organism failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by conglomerate occurrence, is more likely to affect adults with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised to be more likely to be infected than others.
The estimated average of the SARS-CoV-2 incubation period is from 1 to 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average and oscillated from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on the demographic of 8866 cases.
It is very important that the health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time according to the most accurate incubation period; this is how asymptomatic individuals will be expected to transmit the virus to others.
As usual, people exposed to the virus or infected normally should remain in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine extend to 24 days?
The fever is usually the main and initial symptom of the COVID-19, which can be accompanied by any other symptom or other symptoms such as dry cough, dysnea, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat pain, kidney pain, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dysnea or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In serious cases, patients evolved rapidly to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary anomalies in imaging studies, should be tested for an early diagnosis.
A demographic end-of-December 2019 study indicated that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dysnea and 3% for diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed respiratory assistance.
Similar hallucinations were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by the transmission of an asymptomatic person.
In a comparable way, a 2012 demographic study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dysnea (55%) as major symptoms.
However, 80% of them required respiratory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19 and in line with the highest lethality of COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, it was demonstrated that fever (99 %-100 %), dry cough (29 %-75 %), dysnea (40 %-42 %), diarrhoea (20 %-25 %) and throat pain (13 %-25 %) were the main symptoms and respiratory assistance was required in approximately 14 % to 20 % of patients.
By 14 February, the mortality rate of COVID-19 was 2% when the confirmed cases reached 66 576 worldwide.
Similarly, SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10 % in 8096 confirmed cases.
For the MEMS, according to a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37 % in 2494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, it was reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was high and rose to 6.47 with a confidence interval (IC) of 95 % from 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV only oscillated between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-COV-2 with MERS-COV and SARA-COV with symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The previous figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its lethality is less than that of the latter two.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-COV-2 epidemic than the MERS-COV and SARS-COV epidemic.
The occurrence in conglomerates usually occurs within the same family or from the same meeting or vehicle, as a cruise.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected persons or patients in the two weeks prior to appearance.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients with high blood pressure from the hospital can return to the virus, a warning signal that quarantine should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of white blood cells in peripheral blood (especially lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia was observed with a white blood cell count of <4×109/l, including a count of lymphocytes of <1×109/l, and high levels of aminotransferase aspartate in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
Hepatic and muscle enzymes and myoglobin levels were high in the blood of some patients, and reactive protein C and erythrocytic sedimentation were high in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of dimero-D, a product of fibrin degradation in the blood, was high, and lymphocyte count was gradually reduced.
Anomalies are detected in the chest X-rays of most patients with COVID-19, characterized by shadow or bilateral enamel-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients usually develop atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
When SDRA occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously affect gas exchange.
Dysfunction of Type I and Type II pneumonia decreases the surfactant level and increases surface tension, which reduces lung capacity to expand and increases the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Therefore, the worst found in chest X-rays are usually in parallel with the maximum severity of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the decomposition of the neutrophils, the formation of a hyaline membrane and the infiltration of lymphocytes into the interstitial, and multinucleated sinic cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, which coincides with the pathology of a viral infection and SDRA, and similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by a chain reaction of polymerase with reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations for diagnosis (which were no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China began to be used on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and imperative for an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for the use of the SHERLOCK technique based on CRISPR to detect SARS-COV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of the SARS-COV-2 RNA between 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per sample microlitre) using a graduated variety within a time that does not require complex instruments.
Fortunately, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience if it is found in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors may mostly provide support to patients with COVID-19, while testing with a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed before for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current or potential treatment with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Plasma of recovered patients has been proposed to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to see who develops first antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
The SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the beginning and is likely to also attack, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing the ACE2, such as the digestive system and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the greatest threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Consequently, respiratory assistance is critical to relieve symptoms and save lives, including general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat heart failure or potentially fatal respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of the functions of vital organs are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Cytokines is known to be the result of an exaggerated reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokines storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNg and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a huge number of free radicals that are the main cause of the SDRA and multi-organism failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokines storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal IL6 receptor antibody, have been used to treat the storm of cytokines.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokines storm are the modulation of the immune response directed by T cells; the blocking of IFN-g, IL-1 and TNF; the inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; a suppressor of the route 4 of cytokines signaling, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe pulmonary lesions in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the other hand, they may cause serious side effects, in particular osteonecrosis, which significantly affects the prognosis.
However, careful use of low to moderate corticosteroids has been recommended for a short period of time for patients with COVID-19 in a critical state.
At the date of this analysis, the efficacy of no antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, the efficacy of remedesivir, a nucleotide analogue, administered intravenously in a U.S. patient with COVID-19, has been demonstrated.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, the remedisive also demonstrated the potential to inhibit other viruses with single-chain RNA, such as Mers and SARS viruses.
On the basis of these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to carry out a couple of tests in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is great hope for the results.
In addition, baracitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, hepatic damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibody generation
The blood extraction of patients who recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people so that they do not contract the disease is not something new.
In fact, recovered patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies to the pathogen in the blood.
Antibodys are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by the B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other strange objects, and recognize certain molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
On this basis, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COPID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
His symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by a reduction in inflammation and viral load and a better saturation of oxygen in the blood.
However, it is necessary to verify and clarify this to propose the method for its large-scale use until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some adverse events associated with plasma should be considered in close consideration.
For example, antibodies may overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokines release syndrome, which may result in fatal toxicity.
Blood antibodies are usually low, and plasma demand is high to treat patients in critical condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies with sufficient speed to combat a global pandemic.
It is therefore more important and practical to isolate the B cells of the recovered patients and identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or seek effective antibodies against the essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
The MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend largely on a combination of several components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis of a disease according to the MCT theories.
Most of the effective components remain unknown or inaccurate, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, the MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, it was determined that Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The main recovery rates in treatment of patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces of China that used CST in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while the province of Hubei, which used CCT in only about 30% of their patients with COVID-19, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a rather approximate comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (MO) treatment only with combined treatment of MO and MCT.
They found that the time needed for the recovery of body temperature, the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone.
What is more surprising is the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the MCT is still waiting for more well-controlled tests on larger scale and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and to identify the effective components of MCT treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19 are generally very afraid of highly contagious and even fatal disease, and quarantine patients also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as the adverse effects of treatment, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, may cause more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early stage of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric morbidities, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychopathic excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal tendencies, were reported.
The tracking of contacts and compulsory quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people feel more nervous and guilty about the effects of contamination, quarantine and stigma on their relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be given to patients with COVID-19, suspects and persons in contact with them, as well as to the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary mental health equipment, clear communication with regular and precise updates on the outbreak of SARS-COV-2 and treatment plans and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of infected animal and human reserves to susceptible guests, and often complement antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein-based S vaccines to generate powerful and long-term neutralising antibodies or immunity that protects against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines with live virus attenuated in animal models for SARS have been evaluated.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these possible vaccines in older people and models of lethal stimulation and protection against infection by zoonotic virus should be determined before a clinical study is started.
This is probably because the SARS expired 17 years ago and no new cases have been registered since then.
On the other hand, cases and conglomerates of MES remain sporadically in the Middle East that spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MES using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmas, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-COV-2 for non-immune people is an urgent and decisive task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of the coronavirus.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has recently begun to manifest its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can be gradually recovered without sequelae.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a forecast model for the disease is essential for health agencies to be able to prioritise their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the predictive of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: age was the most important factor for the SARS forecast, which is also confirmed for the COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred mostly in people aged 30 to 65 years and 47.7% of these patients were over 50 years of age in a study of 8866 cases, as described above.
Patients who were more likely to require intensive care had underlying comorbidities and complications and were significantly greater than those who did not require them (means 66 to 51 years of age), suggesting that age is a predictive factor in the evolution of patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as described earlier.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care most likely suffer from acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-COV-2 can also bind to positive ACE2 colangiocytes, which may cause liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that the age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: Reactive protein C level (PCR) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a potential prognosis factor for the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
Furthermore, the correlation between the level of PCR and the severity and forecast of the COVID-19 has been proposed.
In addition, a high level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aminotransferase aspartate (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict patient development.
These enzymes are strongly expressed in several organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when the tissue is damaged.
Therefore, they are traditional markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: chest radiography and temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other symptoms for predicting clinical outcome and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: as previously described, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since the use of high doses of corticosteroids in patients with severe SARS was extended, many survivors developed avian osteonecrosis with permanent incapacity and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: as described earlier, during the outbreak of COVID-19, many patients suffered extraordinary stress, as they generally endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and attended the death of close relatives and other patients.
It is essential to provide long-term psychotherapy and support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to their normal life.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 seems to have epidemiological characteristics different from those of SARS.
In addition to being replicated in lower respiratory pathways, SARS-CoV-2 can be efficiently replicated in upper respiratory pathways and cause mild or no symptoms in the early phase of the infection, as happens with other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected in the early stage or incubation period may produce a large number of viruses during their daily activities, making it extremely difficult to control the epidemic.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were severely ill, while the transmission was mostly not in the early phase.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Major efforts are being made at this time in China, including the closure of Wuhan and the surrounding cities and the continued quarantine of almost the entire population with the hope of interrupting the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Although these measures are causing significant damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the acceleration of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the outbreak will be completed by March and the descent phase will last 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., felt that the COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than the SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-COV-2 was detected in both nasal and pharyngeal exudations in patients who had recovered and had left hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode similar to the influenza.
However, promising signs have been seen in China given the decrease in the number of new cases, indicating that the current strategies could be operating.
Originally, it was predicted that the Ebola would cause up to one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, by means of a quarantine and strict isolation, the disease has been controlled.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is weakened in terms of infectivity and eventually is spread out or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through the cough or the hurdles, and possibly also through direct contact with contaminated materials with the virus.
The virus was also detected in the faeces, which suggests a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41 per cent of cases may have been caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 medical care providers.
Caution should therefore be exercised in order to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and, even, transients in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense that could be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical masks and masks with N95 ( serial number 1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the fluid droplets of a potentially infected person from passing through the air or sticking to the surfaces, from where they could be transmitted to other persons.
However, only N95 masks (series number 1860) can protect against the inhalation of viruses as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of viruses can penetrate them completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both measure about 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks, medical care providers in direct contact with patients should use the N95 masks (series number 1860) and not the surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical care providers should use isolation stickers to further reduce contact with viruses.
The viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite having used a mask N95; the virus may have entered its body through its inflamed eyes.
Therefore, medical care providers should also use protective scars or transparent glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that the population wash hands with disinfectant soaps more closely than usual, try to stay at home in voluntary quarantine and limit contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet are considered to be an appropriate distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-COV-2 appeared as a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-COV, as reported January 7, 2020, should have caused high alerts in China for its experience with the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was only until 19 January 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Centre calmed the citizens by saying that the new virus had low contagion and limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that there would be no problems in preventing and containing the disease.
This message significantly released the public's alarm, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical time was taken to contain the disease on a minimum scale in Wuhan.
Chinese disease control agencies should learn from this tough lesson and make decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more careful in making public announcements, as each word matters to citizens and may change their attitude or decisions; (2) more sensitive and responsive to unusual clinical information, rather than waiting for the formal reports of doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a possible epidemic at its early stage, rather than trying to calm the public; and (4) more regular in the implementation of adapted and effective models to increase public awareness about epidemic diseases and to test and improve the response system of society periodically.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-COV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has been spread throughout China and about 50 more countries around the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-COV, and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has generated the reappearance sensation of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between the COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people than young people and more men than women, and gravity and mortality are also greater in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91 per cent versus 1.44 per cent).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus although they do not have symptoms, while patients with SARS generally do so when they are seriously ill, which creates a much greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widespread than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-COV-2 may negatively occur in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, healed patients can give positive results in the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Given the rapid progress made in the investigation of COVID-19, several important issues remain to be addressed, such as:
Where did the SARS-COV-2 come from?
Although 96% of genetic homologies were found between SARS-CoV-2 and two coronaviruses similar to SARS, it is still not possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from mice.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original guest, say, the musculoskeletals, to humans?
Not knowing the answers to number 1 and 2, it is not possible to effectively stop the transmission, and the blast can resuscitate at any time.
Although molecular modelling and biochemical testing have shown that SARS-CoV-2 joins the ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also join the cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically while transmitting between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, will it be extinguished like SARS or will it periodically resuscitate like flu?
Although it may take some time, it is essential to find answers to these and many others.
However, at all costs, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal life.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of the coronaviruses and its guests, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, two human coronaviruses were known to cause mild diseases, such as common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the coin by revealing how devastating and deadly can be an infection by human coronary viruses.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 put crownviruses in the centre of attention again and surprised us with a high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to your brother, SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonose and it would be useful for us to know the zoonotic origins of human coronavirus.
Most human coronaviruses have their origin in the musculoskeletal system, in which they are not pathogens.
It is also known to guests of the intermediate reserve of some human coronaviruses.
Identifying animal guests has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
In addition, investigating the interactions between coronavirus and animal guests could provide important information on the pathogen of coronavirus in humans.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the existing knowledge about the seven human coronaviruses, with emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as on their zoonotic origins and the transmission between species.
Significantly, we compare and contrast the different human coronaviruses from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current disease epidemic by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is being analyzed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful guest changes and the implications of the evolution of the virus in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronavirus belongs to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a group of positive single-catatenary DNA viruses.
These viruses, which host the largest genome, from 26 to 32 kilobases, among the RNA viruses, were called coronavirus because of their morphology, because of the form of crown that they have under an electronic microscope.
As for its structure, coronaviruses have un segmented genomes that share a similar organization.
About two thirds of the genome contains two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into replicable polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 nonstructural proteins called nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including sprig (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A series of specific protein accessories of each lineage are also encoded by different lines of coronavirus.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified in four genders (alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus), including the betacoronavirus genus containing most of the human coronaviruses and are subdivided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
The phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents are the source of genes of most alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus, while birds are the main reservoir of gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly crossed the barriers of species and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
So far, seven human coronaviruses are known.
Among them, HCV-229E and HCV-NL63 are alphacoronavirus.
The other five betacoronaviruses are HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV) and SARS-COV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as common cold or diarrhoea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and recently identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe respiratory tract infection in a relatively higher number of patients, with a higher probability of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretion of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, which cause limited symptoms.
In fact, until the outbreak of SARS, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronary virus infection is generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating in the current history and infected more than 8,000 people, with a gross fatality of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arab peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), later known as SARS-CoV-2, is the agent responsible for the ongoing epidemic of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which has been collected more than 3120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of 3 March 2020.
The alarm has been ringing and the world must prepare for the approaching SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven human coronaviruses have a zoonotic origin in mice, rats or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all human coronaviruses in mustilagos, in which viruses are well adapted and are not pathogens, but have great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Traceting the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses provides a framework for understanding natural history, impulse force and the inter-species obstacle factors.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reserve and intermediate animal and amplifier guests of SARS-CoV-2, which would have significant implications for the prevention of future spread.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the zoonotic origins, the transmission between species and the pathogen of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we highlight and analyze the common theme that the parent viruses of human coronaviruses are usually not pathogens in their natural reservoir guests, but that they become pathogens after transmission between species to a new host.
We also look at the trend in human coronavirus development, in which the increase in transmissibility often leads to a decrease in pathogenicity.
The evolution of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also analysed in this context.
The animal coronavirus has been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of HCV-229E was first isolated from the nasal secretion of patients who had contracted a common cold, different coronaviruses had been isolated in different infected animals, such as the poultice, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discoveries of human coronaviruses in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first HPV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory pathways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow in cellular lines WI-38 of the lung.
Patients infected with HCV-229E had symptoms of the common cold, such as headache, rash, general nausea and throat pain, with fever and cough in 10~20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCOV-OC43 was isolated from the cultivation of organ and the later serial passage into the brains of infants.
The clinical characteristics of HCV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A and rhinovirus viruses.
Both HCV-229E and HCV-OC43 are distributed around the world and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season, in Tempated climates.
Generally, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by a period of illness of about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients presented a serious infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "atypical nemony", caused the first pandemic caused by a well documented human coronavirus in the history of mankind, and the etiological agent is the SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus that was discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 reports of 774 deaths and spread by many countries and continents.
Apart from the superprogators, it was calculated that each case could occur approximately two secondary cases, with a period of 4-7 days incubation and the maximum viral load appears on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, general malaise and scallops, followed by dysnea, cough and difficulty breathing like late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, altered hepatic function and high level of quinase creatinine are common abnormal results in SARS laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and an increase in macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical respiratory assistance.
In addition to the lower respiratory pathways, several organs, including gastrointestinal tube, liver and kidney, may also be infected in these serious cases, usually accompanied by a storm of cytokines, which could be fatal, especially in immunodepressed patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open-air lung biopsy of a family of the initial patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to investigate human coronaviruses.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was determined that it was prevalent in small children, adults and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of cortex, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus of a nasal sample taken from an 8-month child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed by the world.
It has been estimated that HCV-NL63 causes approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its maximum incidence occurs at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
The HCV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crop.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchiolitis acquired in the community, it was reported that HCOV-HKU1 was associated with acute asthma exacerbations.
Like HCV-NL63, HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 was worldwide and caused mild respiratory diseases.
These four human coronaviruses acquired in the community have adapted well to humans and, in general, are less likely to move to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred due to unknown causes, such as in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe infection of lower respiratory pathways in China.
In general, when these human coronaviruses acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogens.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the cases confirmed in the laboratory are from the Middle East, cases have been recorded with occasional contact with close contacts in several European and Tunisia countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal impairment, which so far alone is given with MERS among the diseases caused by human coronavirus.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 confirmed cases were recorded in the laboratory, with a high fatality of 34.4 %, which makes the MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses for people known to know.
From mid to the end of December 2019, conglomerate patients with pneumonia were detected in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, which were retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of infection of the lower respiratory tract caused by SARS-COV-2 a public health emergency of international importance and also called the COVID-19 disease.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a gross fatality of 3,4 %.
Significantly, the lethality in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which is presented as fever, cough and dysnea.
Diarrhoea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can rapidly evolve to acute respiratory difficulties syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to a 82% high nucleotide sequence homology, they are classified in different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic, but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, which could contribute to their rapid spread worldwide.
When comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
First, the period of incubation and the duration of the human coronavirus disease course are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronary viruses.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 occurs between the SARS-CoV and the four human coronal viruses acquired in the community (i.e. HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection presents characteristics that are most frequently observed in human-acquired coronary infections in the community, including the presentation of non-specific or mild symptoms or, even, the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of serious cases of COVID-19 is also observed as a result of SARS-CoV infection, although the relationship is slightly smaller.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-COV-2 also shows interesting patterns of both human coronaviruses acquired in the community and SARS-COV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after human passage, as is the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with the other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in faecal samples.
If the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, it still needs to be diluted in future studies.
It is also of particular interest to find out if SARS-CoV-2 could show stationliness, as is the case with human coron virus acquired in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after human transition, will have an impact on the final release of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
The four human coronaviruses acquired in the community that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it could also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, they could both be survivors of ancient human coronavirus pandemics.
Human coronaviruses that cause serious diseases in humans and humans that developed serious diseases by human coronavirus have been eliminated.
In order for this to happen, human coronaviruses should be replicated in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counter to the host's restriction factors.
In this sense, while the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists more and more infected people, it will be more likely that it will fully adapt to humans.
If properly adapted, its transmission to humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other measures to control the infection.
For many years, the four coronaviruses acquired in the community have circulated in human populations and caused common colds in people with immunosupply.
These viruses don't need an animal reserve.
On the contrary, SARS-COV and highly pathogenic MERS-COV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between humans is unsustainable.
They need to stay and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the opportunity to spread to susceptible human objectives, possibly through one or more intermediate and amplifying guests.
The SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
It is highly transmissible as human coronaviruses acquired in the community, at least for the moment.
However, it is more pathogenic than human coronaviruses acquired in the community and less pathogenic than SARS-COV or MERS-COV.
It remains to be seen whether it will be fully adapted to humans and circulated among humans without a reserve or intermediate animal guest.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, we will need to examine the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and human coronavirus amplifiers.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host of a human coronavirus if it hosts a closely related ancestor that shares a high homology at the level of the sequence of nucleotides.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and is not pathogen in this guest.
Similarly, a reserve guest hosts a continuing and long-term human coronavirus.
In both cases, the guests are naturally infected and are the natural guests of the human coronavirus or its parental virus.
On the other hand, if the human coronavirus was introduced to the mid-guest just before or almost at the same time as its introduction to humans, it is not well adapted to the new guest and is usually pathogen.
The mid-guest can act as the zoonotic source of human infection and perform the amplifying guest function by allowing the virus to be transboundaryly replicated and then transmitted to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
A human coronavirus may cause an infection in the terminal host if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate guest.
On the contrary, human coronaviruses can also be adapted to the intermediate guest and, even, generate long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate guest becomes a natural reserve guest.
Epidemiological data retrospectively revealed that the initial case of SARS had had contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent studies on seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-COV compared to that of the general population.
Cives of masked palm trees (Paguma larvata) and a live animal market mapping dog were the first identified carriers of viruses similar to SARS-CoV that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more cases of SARS were recorded after killing all citizens of the markets.
However, it was reported that the shells of wild or farmed palm trees without exposure to live animal markets were mostly negative in SARS-CoV, suggesting that shells of the palm trees masked would only act as an amplifying intermediate guest, but not as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Significantly, since 80 % of the different animals on the Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility of several small mammals also acting as mid-term guests of SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All of them seem to be SARS-CoV terminal guests.
Subsequent searches of the natural animal guest of the SARS-CoV revealed a highly related coronavirus, called CoV HKU3 of the Rhinolophus mural plant related to the SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese mural murals.
These bats are positive in anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the gene sequence of SARSR-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other musculoskeletal coronaviruses share a 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have been the basis of the new concept that musculoskeletal diseases are home to emerging pathogens in humans.
Several coronaviruses similar to SARS (SL-CoV) have also been identified in mice, but none, except one called WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
The human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) convertor enzyme is known to be the recipient of SARS-CoV.
It was demonstrated that the WIV1 obtained from a fecal musculoskeletal sample uses the ACE2 of musculoskeletal, civet and human receptors to enter the cells.
Surprisingly, patients with convalescent SARS were able to neutralize WIV1.
Up to now, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in mucilelagos, which shares a 95 per cent sequence homology of nucleotides.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV and that mustlegs are not the guest of the SARS-CoV-reservatory.
According to the phylogenetic analysis, the MERS-CoV is classified in the same group as the CoV-HKU4 munitions and the CoV-HKU5 munitions.
The CoV-HKU4 musculoskeletal and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, the dipeptil peptidedase 4 (DPP4) for the virus entry.
The sequences of polymerase RNA dependent on MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to its betacoronavirus counterparts identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, you can't find a live MERS-CoV in wild murals.
The MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the CoV-HKU25 of musciélago, share a sequence homology of nucleotides of only 87 %.
Therefore, the Murciélago may not be the immediate reservation guest of the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that sero-positive serotypes in the neutralizing antibodies of the MERS-CoV have specifically, as have the camels from the Middle East in several African countries.
A MERS-CoV live identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal exodus of sromedaria, which supports even more than camels act as guests of a good reliable MERS-CoV reserve.
It should also be noted that mild symptoms were generally observed, but a massive spread of the virus on infected camels for research with MERS-CoV.
Notably, infected camels spread viruses not only by respiratory means, but also by fecal-oral means, which is also the main route of virus spread of musculoskeletal diseases.
However, there are still questions, as many confirmed cases of MES do not have a history of contact with camels before symptoms occur, which is reasonably attributed to the transmission between humans or unknown transmissions involving unknown animal species hosting MES-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a nucleotide homology of 96.2% with a coronavirus of mucilelagus, RatG13, isolated from the Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is too large to assign a parental relationship.
In other words, bats could not be the immediate reserves guests of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are found in the future coronaviruses of bats practically identical.
Presumably, mid-animal guests of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species sold and killed in the majority of the Huaan marine market, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a likely event of animal transmission to humans.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of small mammals, known as pangolines (Manis javanica), could also host ancestral betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genomes of this new pangoline coronavirus share a 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to the RATG13, with an identity of about 90 % at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
They are grouped into two viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with a 97.4% amino acid sequence identity.
In marked contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and the RATG13 are more diverse, despite a higher degree of sequence homology across the genome.
A previous study in patients with pangoline also reported the detection of viral contaminants in lung samples, which are also related to SARS-COV-2.
This study adopted different methods of assembly and manual healing to generate a partial genome sequence of about 86.3% of the full length viral genome.
We cannot dismiss the possibility that the pangoline is one of the intermediate animal guests of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence that supports a direct origin in the SARS-CoV-2 pangoline due to the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronaviruses of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is even less than that between SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronaviruses of pangoline related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolines and other mammals still needs to be established.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangoline, betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 share the highest complete gene sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the beta-coronavirus betaBDs of pangoline related SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is due to the converging evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counter-proposal supports a recombination between pangoline betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As a driving force in evolution, the recombination is extended between betacoronaviruses.
A conclusion has not yet been reached on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the zoonotic origin of HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 was also studied.
The phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCV-NL63 and HCV-229E could have been derived from musculoskeletal coronaviruses, while parental viruses of HCV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It was reported that a coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (coronavirus of the Apalaches Mountains) detected in a North American tricolor munitions had a close relationship with the HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, the HCV-229E was genetically related to another musculoskeletal coronavirus, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although it has also been suspected of camels as intermediate guests.
For more clarity, the knowledge available until the time of the animal origins of the known human coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of transmission events of human coronaviruses among species in history.
When the HCV-OC43 crossed between species to infect humans from livestock in 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic occurred.
The transmission backgrounds between HPV-229E species are not known with such precision.
There have been severe musculoskeletal alphacoronaviruses associated with HCV-229E.
Among them is an alpharonavirus of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of the virus from musculoskeletal to human directly.
First, unlike the alpacas, humans could have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have close contact with the alpacas.
Secondly, the alpha-coronaviruses of musculoskeletal related to HCV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in musculoskeletal diseases, while the alpha-coronaviruses of alpaca caused a respiratory outbreak in infected animals.
Finally, no alpha-coronavirus has been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpacas acquiring human-related HCV-229E-related alphacoronavirus cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogens in humans, such as anger virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It would therefore not be too surprising for the bats to transmit the HCV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while musculoskeletal alphacoronaviruses act as a genetic repository of the HCV-229E, alpacas and dreamers could act as intermediate guests that transmit viruses to humans, in particular in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-COV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission, from bats to rudeliers, and from rudeliers to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-COV in the morsilagos, is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by subsequent findings.
It is evident that musculoskeletal musculoskeletals contribute, with a prouscous accumulation of virus species, to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and the transmission between species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and the great ability to fly, are all favourable conditions that make mustlegs the ideal "virus propagator".
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been introduced into the drums for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, who have ceased to be an intermediate guest, to be a stable and natural reserve guest.
Mers-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident, and humans remain a terminal guest of the MERS-CoV, as transmission is unsustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolines, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, pangoline betacoronaviruses are highly pathogenic in the pangoline.
They may be a terminal guest of the betacoronavirus-related SARS-CoV-2, as are civets in the SARS-CoV case.
Several transmission possibilities between species of SARS-COV-2 animals to humans should be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First of all, bats could be the reserve guest of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with the bats, through the murder or coal mining.
Secondly, pangolines could be one of the intermediate amplifiers in which a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 had recently been introduced.
Human beings contract the virus through the slaughter and consumption of hunting meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
An antibody study is needed in domestic and wild animals.
Thirdly, as mentioned earlier, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolines.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Apart from the different types of animal guests, three main factors in viral terms also play an important role in facilitating coronavirus crossing the barriers of species.
First, its relatively high rate of mutation in the replication of the RNA.
Compared to other single-catenary RNA viruses, the estimated rate of mutation of the coronavirus could be considered "moderate" to "high", with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year, per site 2, according to the phase of adaptation of the coronavirus to new guests.
Coronaviruses have an exorribonuclease of reading testing, the elimination of which results in extremely high metabolism and attenuation or even inviability.
Curiously, it is known that the nucleotide analogue remedesivir removes coronavirus replication by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and DNA polymerase dependent on RNA.
Remedisive is one of the most promising anti-SARS-COV-2 agents that have been tested in clinical trials.
However, crownvirus mutation rates are close to a million times higher than those of their guests.
In addition, the rate of mutation is usually high when coronaviruses are not well adapted to the guest.
Compared with SARS-CoV, which has a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be lower, suggesting a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It is to be hoped that another guest has already been adapted to people.
In addition to SARS-COV-2, this also applies to MERS-COV, which is well adapted to the drummers.
In theory, genetic derivative is unlikely to cause vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 to lose their effectiveness quickly.
Second, the long-term DNA genome of the coronavirus exercises additional plasticity in changing the genome for mutations and recombination and thus increases the likelihood of co-evolution among species, which makes it possible for new coronavirus to occur when appropriate conditions are given.
This is supported by the unique open reading frameworks and the functions of the protein encoded towards the 3' direction of the genome.
Thirdly, coronaviruses change randomly and frequently from templates during the replication of the RNA through a unique "copy-choice" mechanism.
In a guest acting as a mixture vehicle, the chain change occurs frequently during the transcription of the coronavirus RNA.
Full-length and subgenomial RNAs highly homologous could be recombined to generate new coronary viruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in the HCOV-HKU1 and the HCOV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses, such as the SL-CoV mustilage and the CoV-HKU9 mustilage.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor that affects the transmission between species.
Currently, the recombination of SARS-COV is taken as a typical example, which also showed positive selection in inter-species transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between isolated strains of SARS-CoV of humans and civilians, it is believed that SARS-CoV is experiencing rapid adaptation in different guests, in particular with mutations in the S protein RBD.
In general, the S protein RBD of a coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor and is strongly selected by the guest antibodies response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is found in amino acids 318 to 510 in the S1 fragment, which connects to the human ACE2 and its receptors for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV RBD is capable of recognising the ACE2 receptors of several animals, including musculoskeletal, civet, mouse and dog mapping, which allows transmission between virus species.
In fact, it was observed that only 6 amino acid residues were different from those isolated strains of human virus and civets in the RBD and 4 of them are found in connection with the receptor for interaction with the ACE receptor2.
The SARS-CoV of civets has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the affinity of the interaction of the spice protein with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two substitutes of amino acids could be essential for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30 % difference between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV in the S1 protein unit of S implies that the affinity of protein S with human ACE2 could have changed.
In fact, a study of electronic cryomythrocopy indicates the affinity 10 to 20 times greater than that of the human ACE2 and the S-protein of SARS-CoV.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other receiver might be necessary for the transmission of SARS-COV-2.
Surprisingly, HCV-NL63 also joins the ACE2, but with a different part of the S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N in HCV-229E and silic acid 9-O-acetylated in HCV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans, after transmission between species from their animal guests.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of transmission between human coronavirus species is also determined by other dependency and guest restriction factors.
The diversity of these host proteins between humans and natural reserve guests of human coronaviruses, such as mustilators, dreamers and rodents, could constitute a barrier to the transmission of species.
Human coronaviruses should absorb the guest dependency factors and subvert the guest restriction factors in order for the inter-species transmission to be successful.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
An objective genomic investigation of the patient's dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 could be used using advanced CRISPR technology.
The appearance of new human coronaviruses: we leave from zero
The diversity of musculoskeletal coronaviruses provides numerous opportunities for the emergence of new human coronaviruses.
In this sense, the musculoskeletal coronavirus acts as the genetic accumulation of human coronavirus.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also stimulate the development of human coronaviruses and constitute two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-encoding genes has the potential to dramatically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV adhesional proteins, ORF8 has been considered to be important in human adaptation, as virus of musculoskeletal viruses related to SARS-CoV were isolated, but it was determined that different ORF8 proteins were encoded.
An elimination of 29 SARS-CoV nucleotides was found in strains isolated from the onset of the human epidemic.
This elimination divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the exchange of guests.
In addition, SARS-CoV has possible recombination backgrounds with alpha and gammacoronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in the NRA-dependent polymerase RNA.
Recombination locations were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
In the same way, it has been shown that the Epidemic MERS-CoV suffered recombination events between different lines, which occurred in drums in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-COV and MERS-COV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, in which human coronaviruses are recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, which most likely results in the release of viruses from the selection pressures exercised, for example by the host's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full length ORF4 in the HCV-229E prototype strain due to the elimination of two nucleotides.
Although an ORF4 intact in mice and camels related to HCV-229E was observed, the alpha-coronavirus of alpacas presents an insertion of a single nucleotide, resulting in a change of framework.
Finally, although not least important, the evolution of the new human coronaviruses is also driven by the pressure of selection in its reservoir guests.
No symptoms were detected or only mild symptoms were detected when musculoskeletal infections were detected with coronavirus, indicating mutual adaptation between coronavirus and musculoskeletal infections.
It seems that the mustlegs are well adapted to the anatomical and physiological coronaviruses.
For example, defects in activation of proinflammatory response in musculoskeletal disorders effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronary viruses.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in musculoskeletal cells is eliminated due to the positive regulation of the inhibitory receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of Class I molecules of the higher histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity of musculoskeletal musculoskeletal activity could suppress the replication of the coronavirus and affect the reading test of exorribonuclease, which results in selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the guest adaptation.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogens or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir guests, such as mice and camels.
They are vigorously replicated without causing a strong immune response from the guest.
In this, the secret is why there are asymptomatic carriers and what causes serious cases of human infection.
Serious symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and to the storm of cytokines, in which while the stronger the immune response is, the more severe the pulmonary damage.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been dissociated from the coronavirus replication.
The same strategy for delinking the immune response could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is particularly strong in musculoskeletal disorders.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferons at least in the early stages of human SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 in musculoskeletal inflammation is defective.
According to this reasoning, the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasoma with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-COV-2 follows the general line leading to the appearance of SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Although a 95 % nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been found, a 96 % nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2 has also been shown to be a coronavirus with a 96 % nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been determined that civets and other animals in the markets are the same virus to SARS-CoV, immediate intermediate guests of SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Betacoronaviruses of pangolines have been found to be significantly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolines could act as one of the intermediate guests or that pangoline betacoronaviruses could bring gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is done by man, whether deliberately or by accident.
Coronaviruses have recovered the protagonist due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronavirus in mice and other animals has deeply changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reserves of human coronavirus in human transmission.
This evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in the mustlegs and are transmitted to humans through mid-guests.
Since SARS-COV infection originates in contact with people and civilians in the markets, close the wet markets and kill the civilians in them could have been effective in curbing the SARS epidemic.
Following this same reasoning, pangoline should be withdrawn from the wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several lines of betacoronavirus of pangoline closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, if and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolines and other mammals, it remains to be resolved in future investigations.
On the other hand, the MERS-COV has existed in the drummers for a long time.
These camels are an important transport tool, as well as a main source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed by the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in China with the markets of wild animals to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, an integrated approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other measures to control the infection.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could appear that cause outbreaks.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses are circulating in wild state.
In particular, musculoskeletal coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are very different.
There are great possibilities for these zoonotic coronaviruses to evolve and be recombined, resulting in the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible or more lethal in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Based on the bad experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparation and response plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until the opportunity to spread is presented.
Although bats have many features that promote the spread of viruses, human contact opportunities with bats and other wild species can be minimized if they educate the population to get away from them.
The continued monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and its natural guests, which will be useful to prevent the transmission of animals to humans and future outbreaks.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep humans away from the ecological niches of the natural reserves of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces are still missing in the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if the bats transmit an ancestral virus from SARS-CoV-2 to the pangolines, it will be interesting to analyze the circumstances under which bats and pangoline could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats have a more direct role in human transmission, it must be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate guest, it must be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including humans, bats and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, could be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it's a bat, a pangoline or another mammal, it's expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical are identified in their natural guests in the future.
Continued research in this area will facilitate the development of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases"
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of the infection by the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this directive included our experience and is a good reference to combating this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our consciousness and our knowledge gradually increase on the basis of the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our guidelines and provide the most recent diagnostic criteria for "suspected case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused a outbreak, which is now officially known as coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) and the virus was named coronavirus 2 from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guidance that was published online in Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
You've been paying a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our consciousness and our knowledge gradually increase on the basis of the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the Guidelines for Diagnostic and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020 have published a total of seven editions and some contexts have changed considerably.
Now, our director received a comment from Zhou et al., presented a proposal for a simple classification based on his clinical experience.
His work added new evidence for our leadership and is also a valuable reference for this pandemic worldwide.
We support his important work and express our appreciation.
However, its work also needs updating according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnostic and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version of the trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), in order to confirm a suspicious case, it is necessary to combine any point of the characteristics of epidemiological background with two points of clinical manifestations to perform a thorough analysis, or three points of clinical manifestations should be performed if there are no clear epidemiological backgrounds:
Epidemiological backgrounds: (1) travel history or residence in Wuhan city and the surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) previous contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nuclear acid test); (3) previous contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan and the surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) previous contact with confirmed groups (≥ 2 cases of fever or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small areas such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) characteristics in COVID-19 infection images; (3) total white blood cell count showing normal, decreased or decreased lymphocyte count in the early stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with any characteristic of pathic or serological tests as follows: (1) test of a real-time polymerase chain reaction positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the complete viral genome showing high homogeneity to the recognized new coronavirus; (3) positive result for the specific IgM antibody and specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or a change of the specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 negative to positive, or an increase of the title ≥4 times more in the recovery phase than in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time polymerase chain reaction test to detect nucleic acid in blood samples or respiratory pathways was added to the second editions (18 January 2020) and the third edition (22 January 2020).
The detection of pathogens of blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then serological tests were added to the seventh edition.
{NS}
In addition, there is increasingly evidence that reminds us that we should be cautious with atypical asymptomatic and symptomatic patients.
Therefore, the Zhou et al flow chart should be updated, as they classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The rating system should also be verified in other clinical studies and practices.
To conclude, we hope for more direct evidence and ask readers to send us their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspected case" and "confirmed case", we recommend seeking and complying with the newest guidelines of their countries of origin.
Our team will also update our guidelines in a timely way to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the largest number in one day
Bangladesh confirmed yesterday five new deaths due to COVID-19 in one day.
It's the greatest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
Until yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IDCR) reported that the number of infected cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases remaining in their homes.
A total of 17 deaths have been reported.
At an online briefing, the director of the IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were more than 60 years old, two between 51 and 60 years old and one between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said two of the victims were Daca.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 pandemic.
An official of the hospital told Anadolu Agency, a local news media, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anticorruption Commission, who were attending the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video ad, the Minister of Transport by Road and Bridges of Bangladesh, Obidul Quader, said public transport would be suspended for more time than originally planned until next Saturday.
This suspension of public transport had initially begun on 26 March and was expected to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential products, such as medical supplies, fuel and food, is still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on 8 March, two men who returned from Italy and also women from one of them.
As of March 19, these three had already recovered.
More than a million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infections exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronary virus.
The shot took place the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronary virus infections and Zambia had its first death related to the coronary virus.
North Korea stated on Thursday that it was one of the few countries without coronary infections.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours prior to 10:00 a.m., European Central Time (UTC-0800), of 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 coronavirus cases were reported, linked to at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News reported, quoting data from Johns Hopkins University, that Wednesday there were more than 1,000 deaths in the United States caused by coronary virus infections.
Countries around the world have announced more stringent measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the Moscow mayor, extended the city's closure until 1 May.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to receive their salaries without going to work until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency for 15 days; the vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one against.
Saudi Arabia extended the touch of fall in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina throughout the day; previously, the touch of fall was only maintained between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.
Thailand planned to implement a drop point between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended its order to stay home until 1 May.
Supermarkets in Australia lower the limits of hygiene paper by transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australia's Woolworths and Cole's supermarket chains lowered their hygiene paper purchase limits to two and a transaction package in all of the country's supermarkets, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the limit of a package.
These limitations were published as messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the chains.
It was reported that consumers were being overwhelmed by fear of COVID-19 if people had to self-inflicted themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited purchases of toilet paper to deliver home to a package on request.
These changes were introduced after the previous restriction of four packages by transaction applied by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in his press release on 8 March, reported that, with the application of the restriction of four packages, "many supermarkets are still exhausting the product within an hour of delivery", and said that the demand "had no precedents", while ALDI, in a Facebook publication on Tuesday, said it was "unexpected".
Sales went up with a "strong increase" last week, according to a Woolworths vote.
The Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
To alleviate the scarcity even more, Coles requested larger packages to the suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI made stocks available for a special offer of the medium planned with anticipation.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that minorities are trying to increase stocks, but local town restrictions on truck delivery schedules make it difficult.
It provides for an increase in production costs, as the suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of stocks, some supermarkets cannot make the special offer of Wednesday.
In a report at News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retailer sales expert at the University of Technology in Queensland, said that supermarkets provide stocks every night.
He stressed that the hygienic role is a voluminous article, which causes a low number of stocks in numbers, and, when it is exhausted, leaves a wide void in the barns, which intensifies the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea of [that] if there was an abundant amount of article in the stalls, if products such as toilet and disinfectant rolls could [purchase] and there were large amounts, the panic would probably be minimized, said Russell Zimmerman for ABC News.
The recycled health paper manufacturer Who Gives to Crap said on Wednesday that the stocks were exhausted.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures the Kleinex hygiene paper, and Solaris Paper, who manufactures Sorbent, pointed out that they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to maintain supply, according to the report at News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property vendors offered free hygienic role to the first bidder in the auctions in Melbourne, when less auctions were made because buyers had free time the long weekend of the Workers' Day.
The issue of Thursday's NT News, a daily published in Darwin, included a box of eight pages designed to cut and use as a toilet paper.
The supermarkets in principle showed reactions to restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia dated 3 March, in which they said they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have a lot of demand, including masks, disinfectant, dry products, liquid soap and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon it was observed that the UK online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of the toilet paper Andres to two 12-roll packages.
The World Health Organization declares the pandemic of COVID-19
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared pandemic the outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-COV-2.
Although the word "pandemia" refers only to the extent of the spread of a disease, not to how dangerous the specific cases are, WHO stressed the need to encourage Governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their inhabitants in the response, Theodores Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of WHO said.
We are very concerned, both at the alarming levels of spread and gravity, and at the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States, the pandemic “has no precedents”.
In statements published by CNN in February, he said, "In addition to the influence, no other respiratory virus has been traced from the occurrence to the continued worldwide spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, and said, "We've never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus before."
"And we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time," he added.
The new pandemic condition arises after WHO's decision in January to declare outbreak a public health emergency of international importance.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the outbreak, "in conclusion, it's going to get worse."
Until Thursday, Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, and more than 4600 deaths.
Coronavirus pandemic 2019–20 is an ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Coronavirus 2 from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, an international public health emergency was declared on 30 January 2020 and was recognised as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, and about 97 000 deaths were reported as a result.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The case fatality rate was estimated to be 4 per cent in China, while worldwide it ranges from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and lack of air.
Complications may include acute respiratory difficulties pneumonia and syndrome.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth with the cough, keeping away from other people and controlling and self-adhesive people who suspect that they are infected.
The authorities around the world responded through the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantines, drop-offs, hazard controls at the workplace and closures of installations.
The pandemic caused a serious global socio-economic change, the postergization or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and the widespread lack of supplies exacerbated by panic-driven purchases.
Schools and universities closed at national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's student population.
Wrong information on the virus was disseminated over the Internet, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and South-East Asian descent and appearance, and other areas with significant virus cases.
Due to the reduction of travel and the closures of the heavy industry, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities in Wuhan, China, (the capital of Hubei Province) informed a group of cases of unknown cause pneumonia, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
The cases, in most cases, were related to the majority of the Huaan marine market, so it was thought that the virus had a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to the coronaviruses of musculoskeletals, the coronaviruses of pangolines and SARS-CoV. Later, it was discovered that the first person who was suspected of developing symptoms was ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no visible connections to the last group of the wet market.
Of the first group of cases reported in December 2019, two thirds were identified as having a link to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post suggested that a 55-year-old person in Hubei Province could have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases, according to reports, they dropped in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new cases within China.
There may be a considerable number of unreported cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported in young people, and those 19 years of age and under represented 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide. Patrick Vallanance, the United Kingdom’s main scientific adviser, believed that 60% of the British population would have to be infected before effective collective immunity could be achieved.
Cases relate to the number of persons who were subjected to COVID-19 tests and who obtained a positive result confirmed in accordance with official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had conducted evidence in more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries had official policies to avoid evidence in people who had only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, in China, until 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection of 79% of the reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States determined that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are recovered.
For those who do not, the time spent on the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, being the most frequent 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, on 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths corresponded to persons over 60 years of age and 75 per cent had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official records of deaths by the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to deceased persons who gave positive evidence of COVID, according to official protocols.
The number of real deaths due to COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who died without the test, for example, in their homes, in old homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy revealed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official record of deaths by COVID in a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) voice admitted "We know [the number of deaths reported] is a underestimation", a statement corroborated by U.S. sub-content anecdotic reports. This underestimation is common in pandemics, as in the 2009 swine flu pandemic H1N1. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside continental China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
As of 28 February, more than a dozen deaths were recorded outside continental China in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, in all continents except Antarctica, and a number of indicators are generally used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time spent from the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The proportion of deaths over cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the global proportion of deaths in cases is 6.0 % (97 039/11 617 204) as at 10 April 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, estimates of the proportion of deaths in cases decreased from 17.3% (in those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other indicators include the fatality rate per case, reflecting the percentage of diagnosed people who have died from a disease, and the fatality rate per infection, reflecting the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who have died from a disease.
These statistics do not have a specific time limit and consider a specific population from infection to the resolution of the case.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of Oxford University estimates that the fatality rate for pandemic infections as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first random tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analysed the impact of the tests on the estimates of the fatality rate per case.
WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the blast are uncertain and may vary according to location.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania said, "Infectious outbreaks, if not controlled, generally stabilize and then begin to decrease when the disease remains unavailable.
But at this point, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable predictions when that will happen."
The main medical advisor to the Government of China, Zhong Nanshan, argued that it could "end in June" if all countries could be mobilized to follow the WHO recommendation on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that the SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, possibly for one or two years".
According to the study of the Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (possible for 18 months or more).
William Schaffner of the University of Vanderbilt said, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus, since it is transmitted so easily, disappears completely" and "it could become a seasonal disease that reappears every year".
The virulence of reappearance would depend on the collective immunity and magnitude of the mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Uncommon symptoms include fatigue, exposure to respiratory tract (flema), loss of appetite, lack of air, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, headache, vomiting, haemoptysis, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO says that about one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pressure or persistent pain in the chest, sudden confusion, difficulty in waking up and blue in the face or lips; prior to the manifestation of these symptoms, immediate medical attention is recommended. The biggest advance of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, not presenting clinical symptoms, although the results of the test confirm the infection, therefore the researchers advised to monitor and carefully examine those who have close contact with infected people confirmed in order to discard the infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic individuals range from a little to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) covers one to 14 days; most often it is 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30% and then decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the disease is spread are still being determined.
It is believed that the disease is spread mainly during close contact and through small drops that occur in the cough, cough or talk; close contact is considered a distance of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
According to the studies, without the mouth covered, the droplets can be moved from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated when speaking. Respiratory drops can also be produced during exhalation, even when speaking, although the virus is generally not transmitted by air.
The drops can enter the mouth or nose of people who are close to them or possibly inhale into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as the intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (RCP), can cause aerosolization of respiratory secretions and therefore air propagation.
It can also be spread when you touch a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then you touch the eyes, nose or mouth.
While there is concern that it can be transmitted through the actions, this risk is believed to be low.
The Government of China denied the possibility of oral fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although the spread may be possible before symptoms and at more advanced stages of the disease are revealed.
People received positive results in the disease tests up to three days before the onset of symptoms, indicating that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
There are only some reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but some countries have identified an asymptomatic transmission during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argues that, although it is not completely clear the ease with which the disease is spread, usually one person is infected with two or three others. The virus survives from hours to days on the surface.
In particular, it was determined that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, one day in cardboard and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varied according to humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in tests of COVID-19 performed on pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other areas that could have affected infected persons.
Coronavirus 2 from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which isolated for the first time three people with pneumonia associated with the acute respiratory disease group in Wuhan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the related coronal viruses in nature. Outside of the human body, the virus dies when contacting jabon, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It's believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically grouped with the genus betacoronavirus, its subgener sarbecovirus (line B) together with two strains derived from the musculoskeletal system.
At the full genome level, 96 % is identical to other musculoskeletal coronavirus samples (BatCov RatG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in amino acids in some parts of the genome sequences between the pangoline viruses and those of human beings.
To date, the comparison of the complete genome has indicated that the pangoline coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 share by a maximum of 92 % of the genetic material, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that the pangoline is the intermediate guest.
The virus infection can be temporarily diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although ultimately it is confirmed through the polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or through computerized tomography images.
According to a Wuhan study comparing polymerase chain reaction to computerized tomography, computerized tomography is much more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the features in images match the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "do not use computerized tomography as a method of detection or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO has published several DNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses the polymerase chain reaction with inverse real-time transcriptase (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed in blood or respiratory samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours or days.
This test is usually carried out with a nasopharyngeal hisopia, although it can also be used a hisopia for the throat. Some laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these proved to be accurate enough to approve its generalised use.
In the US, a serological test developed by Celex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The characteristic features in the images of computerized radiographics and tomography (TC) of symptomatic individuals include asymmetric peripheral glass opacity and absence of pleural discharges.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an international database of results obtained in confirmed case images.
Due to the overdose with other infections such as adenovirus, the diagnosis of images without confirmation through a polymerase chain reaction has a limited specificity in the identification of the COVID-19.
A comprehensive study conducted in China compared the results of thoracic computerized tomography with those of polymerase chain reaction and demonstrated that, although the diagnosis of images is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a detection tool in the areas affected by the epidemic.
Convolutional neuronal networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect the characteristics of the virus in images, both with radiographics and with computerized tomography.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include keeping a good general personal hygiene, wash your hands, avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with your hands without washing them before, and sneezing or coughing on a disposable panel and throwing the panel directly into a waste container.
It is recommended that those who may already be infected use a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures are also recommended to prevent transmission; many Governments have restricted or disincentived all non-essential journeys from and to the countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community proliferation in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community do not know where or how they were infected. It is recommended that medical care providers who are dealing with someone who may be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions and use eye protection. Trace of contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the origin of an infection and to prevent a higher transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by Governments for this purpose has generated concerns about privacy, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement demanding limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications for voluntary use have been implemented or proposed, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on solutions that respect privacy, such as using Bluetooth to register a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
The users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who gave positive evidence of COVID-19. They are circulating wrong ideas about how to prevent infection; for example, nasal washing and mouthwashing stores are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDCs recommend that people wash their hands frequently with water and soap for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bath or when they have their hands clearly dirty; before eating and after sounding the nose, cough or cough.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus dies when contacting jabon, which disintegrates its protective bubble.
CDCs also recommended the use of an alcohol-based disinfectant with at least 60 % of alcohol in volume when water and soap are not available.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with their hands without washing them before.
The surfaces may be decontaminated with several solutions (within a minute after exposure to the disinfectant in a stainless steel surface), including ethanol at 62–71 %, isopropanol at 50–100 %, sodium hypochlorite at 0,1 %, hydrogen peroxide at 0,5 % and iodine povidone at 0,2–7.5 %.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDCs recommend that, if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an installation, such as an office or shop, disinfect all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and automatic cassettes used by sick people.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with flexed tail or with a disposable towel or towel, and that they immediately discard the towel.
It is recommended that those who may be infected use surgical masks, as the use of a mask may limit the volume and distance of breathing drops that spread when speaking, stuttering and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Using a mask may reduce the tendency [of] people to touch their face, which is an important source of infection without adequate hygiene." The use of masks in people who care for someone who might have a disease has also been recommended.
WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, for example, those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that using masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Several countries have begun to promote the use of masks by the public.
In the U.S., CDCs recommend using non-medical masks made of canvas. China specifically recommended the use of medical masks that can be discarded by healthy members of the public, especially when they are in close contact with others (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends using a surgical mask to take public transport or to be in competing places.
Sanitary officials in Thailand recommend that people make canvas masks in their homes and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned public spaces without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all people to use a mask while in public spaces to protect and protect others.
The Austrian Government demanded the use of masks by all persons entering a supermarket.
Israel asked all residents to use masks in public.
Taiwan, which has made 10 million masks a day since mid-March, required the use of masks by passengers on buses and buses.
Panama imposed the compulsory use of masks to go out into the open, while it also recommends the manufacture of masks made at home to those who cannot buy them.
Mascarillas have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) includes measures to control the infection designed to prevent the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and closing schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centers.
People can implement social distance methods by staying in their homes, limiting travel, avoiding competing areas, using forms of health that do not include contact and physically distance themselves from other people.
Many Governments now require or recommend social distance in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of the meetings recommended by government agencies and health organizations in the United States was rapidly reduced by 250 (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in one region) to 50 persons, and subsequently to 10 persons.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and compromised immune systems have a higher risk of suffering serious diseases and complications, and the CDC recommends that they stay in their homes as long as possible in areas of the community affected by the outbreak. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began replacing the term "social distance" with "physical distance", to clarify that the goal is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, whether virtual or distance.
The use of the term "social distance" has had an impact on the assumption that people should adopt a complete social isolation rather than encouraging them to keep in touch with others through alternative means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health to be used during the pandemic.
They include recommendations that you only have sexual relations with a person with whom you live, that you do not have the virus or the symptoms of the virus.
Self-adhesion was recommended in the home of those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have published detailed instructions on appropriate self-responsibility; many Governments have demanded or recommended the self-sufficiency of entire populations in affected areas.
The strictest self-care instructions were issued to those belonging to high-risk groups.
Persons who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with a generalized transmission are recommended to make self-quantity for 14 days since the last possible exposure.
The strategies to control a outbreak are containment or suppression and mitigation.
Containment takes place in the first stages of the outbreak and aims to identify and isolate infected persons, as well as introducing other measures to control infection and vaccines to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts are shifted to the mitigation phase: measures are being taken to halt the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
The suppression requires more measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of reproduction to less than 1. Part of controlling the outbreak of an infectious disease involves trying to reduce the epidemic peak, which is known as aggravating the curve of the epidemic.
This reduces the risk of collapse of health services and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, use of masks and self-quate; community measures aimed at physical distance, such as closure of schools and cancellation of mass competition events; community commitment to foster acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental and surface cleaning measures. In China, more drastic measures were taken to contain the outbreak once its severity was evident, for example, the implementation of quarantines in entire cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented mass detection and localized quarantine assessments, and issued alerts on the movements of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial support to those infected who decided to make quarantine and imposed large fines on those who did not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and penalized the accumulation of medical supplies. Simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigation (which decreases the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppression (which reverses the growth of the pandemic) are major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies could reduce the maximum demand for medical care in two thirds and death to half, but still generate hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
The suppression may be preferred, but it must be maintained throughout the entire time that the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if that happens first), because, on the contrary, transmission reacts rapidly when measures are flexible.
Long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic entails social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral medicines approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing medicines.
Taking medicines free of charge for the cold, drink liquids and rest can help relieve symptoms.
According to severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory assistance may be needed.
The use of steroids may worsen the results.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also indicated that some "home and traditional drugs" can alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO describes increased capacity and adaptation of medical care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a fundamental measure of response to outbreaks.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have formulated guidelines for primary medical care hospitals and services for resource redeployment at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 tests, cancel optimizing procedures when possible, separating and isolate patients from positive COVID-19 and increasing intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the number of breathing agents and beds available.
There are several theories about where the first case could have originated (the so-called zero patient).
The first case known as the new coronavirus can be raised on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over a month, the number of cases of coronary viruses in Hubei increased gradually.
These were mainly linked to the majorist marine market in Huaan, which also sold live animals, and a theory is that the virus comes from one of these animals; or, in other words, that has a zoonotic origin. On 26 December, a series of cases of unknown cause pneumonia was observed from those in charge of Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei's Provincial Hospital, who reported to the DRC of Jianghan Wuhan on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan's Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "coronavirus similar to SARS".
The police warned eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, to spread false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was arrested by his superiors for giving the alarm.
Subsequently, on 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note and informed the WHO.
At the beginning of January, sufficient cases of unknown cause pneumonia had been reported to health authorities in Wuhan to initiate an investigation. During the first stages of the outbreak, the number of cases was doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, contributing to the migration for the New Chinese Year and the fact that Wuhan is a transport centre and an important railway crossing.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two persons in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Further official data show that, as of 20 January 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms. As of 26 March, the United States has exceeded China and Italy with the largest number of cases confirmed in the world. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97 000 people have died and more than 364,000 have been recovered.
Some 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National reactions have included detention measures, such as quarantines (known as domestic detention orders, local refugee orders or confiscation) and drop-offs. As of 2 April, approximately 300 million people, or approximately 90 per cent of the population, have completed some form of restraint in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined to the Philippines, about 59 million are confined to South Africa and 13 billion are confined to India.
As of 26 March, 17 billion people around the world had achieved some kind of restraint, which increased to 26 billion people two days later, around the third part of the world population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case occurred on 17 November.
On 26 December, Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of cases of unknown cause pneumonia, and his hospital informed Juanghan's CDC on 27 December.
The first genetic evidence of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
On 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note.
WHO was informed the same day.
While these notifications were being made, the police warned doctors in Wuhan 'to spread rumors' about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially stated that there was no "clear evidence" of transmission between humans.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a dramatic campaign, later described by the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "popular war", to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the greatest quarantine in the history of humanity", a health cord was announced on January 23 that prohibited travel within and outside Wuhan, this extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, and affected about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles in the city was prohibited.
The New Year's celebrations (January 25th) were canceled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Later, another hospital, Leishenshan Hospital, was built to receive more patients.
In addition to the new hospitals built, China also converted 14 other facilities to Wuhan, such as convention and stadium centres, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government implemented more measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, which included the issuance of health statements for travellers and the extension of the spring holiday.
Universities and schools were also closed throughout the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions implemented a number of measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Remote work measures were established in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions were implemented inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was changed and museums were temporarily closed throughout China.
The control of the public movement was implemented in several cities, and it has been estimated that some 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some kind of restrictions on outdoor emissions. Following the beginning of the global outbreak phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "importation" of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travellers entering the city. On 23 March, in mainland China only one case had been transmitted at the national level during the previous five days, on this occasion, through a traveler who returned from Istanbul to Canton.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of cases transmitted at the national level was basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were flexible in Hubei, as well as Wuhan, two months after the restriction was imposed. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that the entry of visa holders or residence permit would be suspended from 28 March, with no specific details as to when this policy will end.
Those who wish to enter China should request visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Government of China encouraged companies and factories to reopen on 30 March and provided economic incentives packages for firms. The State Council declared a day of mourning to begin with a three-minute national silence from 4 April to 10 a.m., meeting with the Qingming Festival, although the Central Government asked families to submit their respects online to meet the physical distance in order to avoid the violation of the COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 was spread from China to South Korea.
On 20 February, the country's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, mainly attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
It is suspected that Shincheonji's devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, of the 9336 church followers, 1261 or about 13% reported symptoms. On February 23, 2020, South Korea declared the highest alert level.
More than 2,000 confirmed cases in Korea were reported on 28 February, which increased to 3150 on 29 February.
All the military bases in South Korea remained in quarantine after the evidence confirmed that three soldiers gave positive for the virus.
The airline schedules were also affected, and therefore changed. South Korea presented what was considered the world's largest and best organized programme to test the detection of the virus in the population and isolate infected people, as well as identify and quarantine those who were in contact with them.
The detection methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by newly arrived persons from other countries through mobile application, drive-thru centres to perform virus detection tests with results available the next day and increasing diagnostic capacity to be able to test up to 20,000 people every day.
South Korea's programme is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not adopting the quarantine in entire cities. South Korea's society was initially polarized in relation to the response of President Moon Jae-in to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed requests to demand the resignation of Moon, which they considered to be a poor management by the Government, or rather, to commend their response.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had total cases on a lower day in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that, from 1 April, all newly arrived persons from outside should remain in quarantine for two weeks.
According to media reports, on 1 April, South Korea received requests for assistance for virus testing in 121 different countries.
On 19 February, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that same day.
Early measures announced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events and Friday's prayers, and the closing of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran destined five billion rivers to fight the virus.
On 26 February 2020, President Hassan Rouhani said there was no plan to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, and that it would only be quarantined for people.
In March plans were announced to limit travel between cities, although heavy traffic between cities as a result of the New Persian Nowruz year continued.
The Chii temples in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. During February, Iran became a centre for the spread of the virus after China.
By means of the allegations of a coverage of the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries had traced their cases to Iran by 28 February, indicating that the magnitude of the outbreak could be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian Government for that date.
The Iranian Parliament closed, and on 3 March 23 of its 290 members reported positive results in the virus test.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged the Iranian penitentiary authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained by peaceful dissidents, as well as temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
It indicated that there is a greater risk of virus spread in closed institutions, such as detention centres, which also lack adequate medical attention.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths on the same day, the largest recorded number in the country since the outbreak.
As of 17 March, at least 12 exhibitors or politicians in Iranian exercise had died of the disease.
As of March 23, Iran experienced 50 new cases per hour and a new death every ten minutes due to coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, there may be five times as many cases as reported in Iran.
It is also suggested that US sanctions on Iran could be affecting the country's financial capacity to respond to viral outbreaks.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the relief of economic sanctions for the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, the spread of the outbreak to Italy was confirmed, when two Chinese tourists gave positive results in the tests of SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to increase rapidly, leading the Italian Government to suspend all flights from and to China and declare the state of emergency.
Subsequently, a group of non-related COVID-19 cases was detected, which began with 16 cases confirmed in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree to contain the outbreak, including quarantine to more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in the north of Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "You will not be allowed to enter or leave the areas affected by the outbreak.
The suspension of work activities and sporting events in these areas has already been ordered." On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the complete closure of schools and universities throughout the country while Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sports events, including the series A football matches, were to be held at closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sports events were suspended completely for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the interruption of virtually all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Respiration and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations of medical ethics on the selection protocols that could be used.
On March 19, Italy exceeded China as the country with the largest number of deaths related to coronary viruses in the world after reporting 3405 deaths by the pandemic.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoverys in Italy, most of which occurred in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy with a large elderly population and the inability to test all people with the virus to date could contribute to the high rate of fatality.
The United Kingdom's response to the first virus emerged as one of the most vulnerable countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government did not impose any kind of social or massive distance measures on its citizens.
As a result, the Government received criticism of the apparent lack of speed and intensity in its response to the public's concerns. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement in which he disincentived social contact and all non-essential travels, and suggested that people work from their homes when possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the Government announced the closure of all leisure facilities, such as bars and gymnasiums, and promised to pay up to 80 per cent of workers' wages up to a limit of GBP 2500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more stringent social distance measures, which prohibited meetings of more than two persons and restricted travel and activities to those considered strictly necessary.
Unlike previous measures, the police could require compliance with these restrictions by imposing fines and dispersal of meetings.
Most companies were ordered to close, with the exception of those considered "essentials", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, railways, gas stations and workshops.

On 28 January 2020, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the main public health institute of the U.S. Government, announced that they had developed their own testing kit.
Despite doing so, the United States had a slow beginning in the realization of the evidence, which concealed the true magnitude of the outbreak at that time.
Evidence was challenged by the defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, the lack of approval by the federal government of non-governmental test kits (academies, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and the restrictive criteria for people to qualify for a test until the beginning of March (then a medical order was required).

The general approval of Trump's crisis management has been polarized between the party lines.
Some US officials and commentators criticised the dependence of the US on the import of critical materials, including special medical supplies, from China.
An analysis of travel patterns was used to identify and predict the spread patterns and was published in The Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.

On 2 April, the World Bank initiated emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to control and control the epidemic.
WHO noted the difference between the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak, when Chinese authorities were accused of preventing prevention and detention efforts, and the current crisis, in which the Central Government "has provided periodic updates to avoid panic in front of New Year's holidays".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement a ban on transport in Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea pointed out that, although "it was definitely not a recommendation made by WHO", it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it was concentrated" and said that "there was no precedent in public health history". On 30 January, after confirming the transmission of human beings outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared outbreaks an emergency of public health of international importance (ESPII), the sixth SPII since the first call for action during the Porcine influenza pandemic in 2009.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said the SPII was "due to the risk of global proliferation, especially to low- and medium-income countries without solid health systems".
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that unduly interfere with international trade and travel" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade or movement".
On 5 February, WHO appealed to the world community for a contribution of $675 million to fund strategic preparation in low-income countries, and called for the urgent support of those countries "that do not have systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, if any."
He also made statements in which he stated that "we are only as strong as our weaker slave" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more in the future". On 11 February, WHO announced at a press conference that COVID-19 was the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros said that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, had agreed to provide the “power of the entire United Nations system in response”.
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team was activated, which allowed coordination of the response of all the United Nations, which, according to WHO, will allow them to “focus on the health response while other agencies can bring their expertise to address the social, economic and wider development implications of the outbreak”.
On 14 February, a joint mission team led by WHO with China to provide international and WHO field experts in China to assist in national management and to evaluate "the severity and transmissibility of the disease" through the organization of workshops and meetings with major institutions at the national level and to carry out visits to the site to assess the "impact of provincial and county response activities, including urban and rural environments". On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world must do more to prepare for a possible pandemic of coronavirus", and noted that, although it was still very ready to call it pandemic, countries should still be "at a preparatory stage".
In response to a emerging outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team to assess the situation there. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global threat assessment of coronavirus would rise from "high" to "high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO's Health Emergency Program, warned in a statement that "This is a verification of reality for all governments on the planet: wake up.
This virus can be on the way and we must be prepared," insisting that appropriate response measures could help the world avoid "the worst."
Ryan also said that the current data did not ensure that public health officials declared a global pandemic, and noted that this statement would mean that "we are basically accepting that all human beings on the planet will be exposed to that virus".
On March 11, WHO declared pandemic the outbreak of coronary viruses.
The Director-General said that WHO was "very concerned, both at the alarming levels of spread and gravity, as well as at the alarming levels of inaction". WHO has received important criticisms as to why an inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late statement of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The negative response included a request for the resignation of WHO Director General, Tedros Adhanom, signed by 733,000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of all persons during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts indicated that everyone had the right to save lives and that the Government had this responsibility.
The group stressed that the lack of medical resources or insurance should never be used as justification for discrimination against a specific group.
Experts noted that all persons have the right to health, including persons with disabilities, those belonging to minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, those living in extreme poverty, persons detained, refugees and other unspecified groups that need government support.
International government organizations are addressing the social and economic impacts of the crisis by COVID-19.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on political responses in countries around the world, in addition to views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to addressing the effects of bordering and travel restrictions, the digital centre includes a country-wide policy tracker, and aims to help countries learn from one another and to facilitate a global coordinated response to the challenges of the crown virus.
The Government of China has been criticized by the United States, the Minister of the Office of the United Kingdom Office, Michael Gove, and the son of the President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for his management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several Chinese Communist Party (PCC) provincial administrators were dismissed because of their management of quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of discontent with the response of the political system to outbreaks in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this measure was taken to protect the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, from the public wrath for the outbreak of coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Zhao Lijian, rejected a prior recognition of the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 in the U.S. or Italy.
The U.S. Donald Trump administration has referred to coronavirus as "Chinese virus" or " Wuhan virus," and said that "China censorship has overfeeded a virus that has now become a global pandemic", which in turn was pointed out by some critics as racism and "distraction" of the failure of its administration to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast received a telegram from the U.S. Government describing a communication strategy with apparent origin in the National Security Council, and quoted the strategy as "Everything about China".
We have been told that we are trying to transmit this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television shows. "Communication media such as Politicians, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to send assistance to countries affected by the virus are part of a global campaign to gain global influence.
The European Union's foreign policy representative, Josep Borrell, warned that "there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and generosity policy".
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also requested the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while reportedly sent assistance to these two last countries.
On 3 April, United States sanctions blocked Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba.
The US authorities were also accused of diverting aid from other countries to their own country.
And disputes have been reported concerning masks between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of air carriers destined for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian Government criticised the lack of solidarity between the European Union and Italy, affected by the coronary virus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the European Union, said that "Only China replied bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80% of Russia's aid was "useless or of little use for Italy".
The source accused Russia of committing an offensive of "geopolitical and diplomatic seduction".
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Luigi Di Mayo, rejected the newspaper reports and expressed their appreciation.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that "by offering help to U.S. colleagues, [Putin] assumes that, when U.S. manufacturers of materials and medical equipment cover impulses, they can also correspond if necessary".
The planned military exercise of NATO "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, NATO's largest war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be carried out on a reduced scale.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticised the 2020 defence exercise: "In the current public health crisis, it endangers lives not only of the United States troops and the various European countries involved, but also those of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian Government was greatly affected by the virus, with about two dozen members of the infected Parliament, as well as 15 other current and previous political figures.
On 14 March 2020, the President of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help, and said that his country is having difficulty fighting the outbreak due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of United States sanctions against Iran. The outbreak prompted the demand that the United States adopt common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal medical care, universal child care, paid family license and higher levels of public health funds.
Political analysts predicted that it could negatively affect Donald Trump's re-election possibilities in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambigu and passive quarantine efforts", after Japan announced that any person from South Korea will remain in quarantine for two weeks on sites designated by the Government.
South Korea's society was initially polarized with regard to Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed requests to demand the resignation of Moon, which they considered to be a mismanage of the government, or, rather, to commend its response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that they could allow Governments to strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, his Parliament voted to allow the Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend Parliament and the elections and punish those who are considered to have disseminated false information about the virus and the management of the crisis by the Government.
Coronavirus outbreak caused several cases of shortage of supplies, as a result of the increased use at the global level of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases and disruptions of logistics and factory operations.
The Food and Drug Administration of the United States has issued warnings about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to the greater demand of consumers and the interruption of suppliers.
Several localities also witnessed panic-driven purchases that left empty tanks of essential products such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, resulting in a shortage of supplies.
The technology sector, in particular, has been warning about delays in sending electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protection equipment increased 100 times.
This demand resulted in an increase in prices of up to 20 times the normal price and also resulted in delays of four to six months in the supply of medical supplies.
It also caused a shortage of personal protection equipment worldwide, and WHO warned that this would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a shortage of formula for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in the north of Italy and Wuhan region, and the subsequent demand for food, none of these areas were affected by acute food shortages.
China and Italy's measures against the accumulation and illicit trade of essential products have been successful, and they have avoided an acute lack of food anticipated in Europe and North America.
The north of Italy, with its important agricultural production, has not had a significant reduction, but prices could increase, according to representatives of the sector.
Food stations were only temporarily empty, even in Wuhan city, while Chinese government officials released the pig meat reserves to ensure sufficient food for the population.
In Italy there are similar laws that require food producers to keep reservations for these emergencies.
The damage to the world economy was felt in China: according to a periodic report of 16 March, China's economy was greatly affected in the first two months of 2020 because of the Government's measures to stop the spread of the virus, and minority sales fell by 20.5%.
Since continental China is an important economic and manufacturing centre, the viral outbreak has been considered a significant threat of destabilization for the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of the potential consequences emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic consequences of the global growth epidemic could surpass those of the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate of an expert at the University of Washington in San Luis indicated an impact of over $3 billion in the world supply chains that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reported to have been "revolving" after a strong drop in oil prices due to China's lowest demand.
On 24 February, world value markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On 27 February, due to the growing concerns about the outbreak of coronavirus, several US stockpiles, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average published their most pronounced drop since 2008, the Dow dropped 1191 points, the largest drop in one day from the 2007–08 financial crisis.
The three indices ended the week with a decrease of more than 10 %.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative perspective.
The actions fell again on the basis of the fears of the coronavirus, the biggest fall occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that there is likely to be an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of the central states and banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the financial collapse in 2008.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public places including travel attractions and the recommendation of Governments not to travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled flights due to the lowest demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while British regional Flybe crashed.
The impact on the cruise industry reached a level never seen before.
Several railway stations and terminals of transshippers have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, an important season of travel related to New Year's Chinese holidays.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year's festivals, while private companies also independently closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events and tourist attractions of the New Year Moon have been closed to avoid massive concentrations, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and traditional temple holidays.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year's holiday until 10 February, and ordered most of the jobs not to be reopened until that date.
These regions represent 80% of GDP and 90% of the country's exports.
Hong Kong raised its level of response to the highest infectious disease and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled its New Year's celebrations. The minority sector was affected at the global level, with reductions in time-consuming or time-consuming schedules.
Visits to minorities in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Minorists from North America and the Middle East experienced a drop of 50 to 60 per cent.
This also resulted in a decrease of 33% to 43% in pedestrian traffic to malls in March compared to February.
Operators of malls around the world imposed additional measures, such as greater hygiene, the installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of buyers and the cancellation of events. According to an estimate of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in an extreme poverty situation in Latin America than they had remained in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the highest point of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's nearly 300 million migrant rural workers were displaced in their homes in inner or captive provinces in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and asked for government help.
Coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate can reach 32%, according to estimates from the Bank of the Federal Reserve of San Luis. In India, the restriction has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who receive daily wages) unemployed. According to the Angus Reid Institute survey, 44% of Canadian households experienced some kind of unemployment. About 900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since the restriction began in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit plan. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have implemented short-term work schemes supported by the Government, known as Kurzwork, for their workers.
The German short-term compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Britain.
The artistic and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, which affected the operations of organizations and people, both employed and independent, worldwide.
Culture and arts organizations tried to carry out their mission (often funded with public funds) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, maintain the safety of their employees and the public and support artists whenever possible.
By March 2020, all over the world and in different degrees, museums, libraries, venues and other cultural institutions had been permanently closed, and their exhibitions, events and shows were cancelled or postponed.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent consequence that increases an accelerated rate of disease is the cancellation of religious services. Important sporting events and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered interruptions. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the celebrations of the Holy Week in Rome, which take place during the last week of the Christian penitentiary season of the Quaresma.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay in their homes instead of participating in the church on Sundays; some churches offered religious services through radio, live Internet or television, while others offer space to pray from the car.
After the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome’s decision to close its churches and chapels and with St. Peter’s Square empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious organizations also canceled their services and limited public concentration in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and guardwaras.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday's funerals in the areas affected by the outbreak and then the sanctuary was closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and their residents to the sacred places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant change in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most of the major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA Championships League 2019–20, the First League 2019–20, the UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019–20 NBA season and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The outbreak interrupted the plans of the 2020 Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event "will be reprogrammed for a later date by 2020 but not after the summer of 2021". Casinos and other playgrounds around the world closed and online poker tournaments were postponed or cancelled.
This caused many gamblers to use the Internet, many online betting sites reported significant increases in their new enrolment rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, several music groups suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many large theaters, like those in Broadway, also suspended all the shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing their work through the Internet as an alternative to the traditional live show, such as live concert broadcasts or the creation of "festivals" on the Internet for artists to interpret, distribute or publish their work.
On-line, numerous Internet memes have been disseminated on the coronavirus, as many resort to humor and distraction in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudices, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and to people in Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
There have been incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia and the Pacific region.
February reports (when most of the cases were still limited to China) have documented racist feelings in several groups around the world expressing that the Chinese deserved the virus or that they were receiving what they considered a fair reprisal.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-circumvention feelings.
Many Wuhan and Hubei residents have reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
The Chinese and those in the areas affected by the virus have received support, both on the Internet and outside of the virus.
Following the advance of the outbreak to new countries where the situation is critical, the people of Italy, the first country in Europe that experienced a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subject to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed requests for the prohibition of Chinese entry into their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was a trend on Twitter.
The Chinese, in addition to other Asian people in the United Kingdom and in the United States, have reported higher levels of racist insults, as well as aggression.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, was criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term that many critics considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Demonstrators in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuations from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students from northeastern India, who share a border with China, and who study in the main Indian cities, suffered harassment in relation to the outbreak of coronary viruses.
The president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata party in West Bengala, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that is why God came from them".
China's consulate in Calcutta then condemned the comments and said they were "erronous". In China, xenophobia and racism increased to non-Chinese residents as a result of the pandemic, and it was described to foreigners as "foreign trash" and intended for "desire".
Many periodicals with pay walls have removed them for parts or the whole of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific editors published scientific articles related to the broth available with open access.
Some scientists have opted to share their results quickly on preprint servers like bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of virus in the samples is confirmed through the polymerase chain reaction test with reverse transcriptase, which detects coronavirus DNA.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had too mild symptoms as to inform them or who were asymptomatic.
Based on the results of this test, a precise mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited evidence, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population until March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were major variations in the number of tests carried out in different countries.
It is also likely that this variability is significantly affecting the fatality rates for reported cases, which are probably very overestimated in some countries.
Through the polymerase chain reaction with inverse real-time transcriptase (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed in respiratory samples obtained through several methods, including nasopharyngeal hyosopharyngeal or spout samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The response test in the polymerase chain with reverse transcriptase performed with pharyngeal hisopates is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In people infected with the test in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the respiratory tract through suction catheter, or the material that is expelled to the cough may be used.
One of the first polymerase chain reaction tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the polymerase chain reaction with inverse real-time transcriptase (rRT-PCR), and constituted the basis of the 250 000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom also developed a test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korea company Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the response chain of the clinical grade polymerase (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
Search for the "E" gene shared by all betacoronavirus and the specific RdRp gene of SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain the approval of emergency use of the Chinese National Medical Products Administration of a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on polymerase chain reaction. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are distributing their polymerase chain reaction diagnosis panel with inverse real-time transcriptase for the new coron virus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to the public health laboratories via the International Reagent Resource.
One of three genetic tests in previous versions of the test kits generated inconclusive results due to defective reagents, and a strain in the conduct of tests in the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, fewer than 100 samples were processed per day throughout February 2020.
The reliability of the two-component tests was not determined until 28 February 2020, and only since that time allowed state and local laboratories to start carrying out the tests.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency authorisation. US commercial laboratories began to test in early March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability at the national level of COVID-19 tests based on the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
Similarly, on 9 March 2020, Quest Diagnostics provided evidence for COVID-19 at the national level.
No limits were announced in the quantity; the collection of specimens and processing should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDCs.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Centre for the Research of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Medical Care Surveillance Service. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect the infection by COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the approval of the FDA for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours in large volumes, allowing a machine to perform approximately 4128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency authorisation for Abbott Laboratories for a test in Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorisations for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid received the same authorisation for emergency use of the FDA for a test that takes approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test using the isothermal amplifying technology of nucleic acids instead of the polymerase chain reaction.
As this does not require a series of temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott plans to increase production to carry out 50,000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a test is being developed using a monoclonal antibody that is specifically bound to the protein of the nucleocapside (protein N) of the new coronavirus, with the hope that it can provide results within a period of 15 to 20 minutes as well as a rapid test for influenza.
In March 2020, the revision of the publications concluded that "Torax radiographs have little diagnostic value in the first stages, while the results of the TC [computerized Tomography] can be obtained even before symptoms occur".
Typical features in the TC include bilateral multilobe-glass opaques with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain, empedral pattern and consolidation develops.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan, at the origin of the current pandemic, where the polymerase chain reaction was compared to the computerized tomography, the computerized tomography is much more sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the features in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "do not use computerized tomography as a method of detection or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19". Since March 2020, CDCs recommend the reaction in the polymerase chain as an initial examination.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people about 7 days after symptoms occur, to determine the immunity and monitoring of the population. Analysis can be performed in central laboratories or by testing at the point of attention.
Automated high-performance systems in many clinical laboratories can perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For central laboratory analysis, a single specimen of peripheral blood is generally used, although serious specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For tests at the point of attention, a single specimen of blood is usually obtained by a puncture in the skin.
Unlike the polymerase chain reaction methods, there is no need for an extraction step before analysis. On 26 March 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that provided notification to the agency as appropriate and therefore can now distribute their antibody tests.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received Europe's approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The ability to perform tests is several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than conventional viral DNA polymerase chain reaction test.
Antibodys can generally be detected 14 days after the beginning of the infection. At the beginning of April, the United Kingdom discovered that none of the antibody test kits it bought were good enough to use them.
Hong Kong has created a program in which suspicious patients can stay in their homes, "the emergency department gives the patient a sample tube", the patient spits on the tube, sends it and gets a result at a short time. The British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyze suspected cases in their homes, thus eliminating the risk that the patient will infect others if they go to the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if one is used. In the tests at drive-through centres for suspected cases, a health professional takes samples with appropriate precautions.
The drive-through centres have helped South Korea to make some of the fastest and most extensive tests in any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Health Insurance Medical said on 2 March that it had a capacity for approximately 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient environment and that 10 700 people had been tested last week.
Health insurance assumes the costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a general capacity to make 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, evidence was offered through the drive-through system in several large cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that at the week of 12/2020, at least 483 295 samples had been analysed, up to and including the week of 12/2020, and 33 491 samples (6.9%) produced positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Institute of Technology and the Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method to analyze samples of 64 patients simultaneously, which consists of grouping samples and only doing more analysis if the combined sample is positive. On 5 February 2020, in Wuhan, the BGI opened an improvised emergency detection laboratory of 2000 square meters called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: ↔, or "Fire Eye"), which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
With the construction, which was supervised by the founder of the BGI, Wang Jian, and which took 5 days, the model showed that the cases in Hubei had been 47 per cent higher and that the corresponding cost of dealing with the quarantine had been doubled without this capacity for testing.
After Wuhan's laboratory, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjín, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
As of 4 March 2020, total daily production was 50 000 tests per day. Multiple open source designs provided by origami analysis were implemented to evaluate up to 1122 samples of patients for COVID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need to use liquid manipulation robots.
In March, the shortage and insufficient amounts of reactors affected massive testing in the European Union and the US.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that involved heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release DNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that United Arab Emirates was now making more proof of the detection of coronary viruses per person in their population than any other country, and was directed to increase the level of testing to cover the majority of the population.
This was achieved through the combination of drive-through capacity and the purchase of a mass production laboratory at the level of the population of Group 42 and BGI (based on their emergency detection laboratories "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory has the ability to perform tens of thousands of polymerase chain reaction tests with inverse transcriptase per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude that works outside China.
Various evidence formulas were developed that address different parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for producing kits that it sent to low-income countries that did not have the resources to develop its own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States was not available until 28 January, which delayed the evidence available in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of the test kits at the start of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia could not provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations of health experts on the tests.
On the contrary, experts say that the high availability of South Korea tests has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The Government of South Korea has achieved its capacity to carry out tests, especially in private-sector laboratories, over several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization requested an increase in testing programmes as the best way to reduce the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for evidence due to the widespread spread of the virus caused hundreds of thousands of testing delays in private laboratories in the United States, and supplies of hisopate and chemical reagents were exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDCs had "failures"; the Government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that had prevented the realization of private testing. Spain bought test kits to the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but obtained inaccurate results.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be due to incorrect collection of samples or incorrect use of kits.
The Ministry of Spain said it would remove the wrong results kits and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic gave China incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million kits to China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they were thrown to the Danube. Ateş Kara, of the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that the test kits Turkey bought to China had a "high error rate" and did not "use them". The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test kits to China, but in early April 2020 announced that they did not serve.
The performance of the tests, supplemented by the quarantine of those who obtained positive results and the identification of the people with whom they had been contacted who had given positive results in SARS-CoV-2, resulted in satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vó, the place where the first death occurred by COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two rounds of trials throughout the population of about 3400 inhabitants, with about ten days of difference.
About half of the people who achieved positive results had no symptoms, and all detected cases were quarantined.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this completely eliminated the new infections.
With intensive tracking of contacts, restrictions on travel from outside, testing and quarantine, the Pandemy for Coronavirus 2020 in Singapore has progressed much slower than in other developed countries, but they have not applied extreme restrictions, such as forced closure of restaurants and minority establishments.
Many events were canceled, and on March 28, Singapore began recommending residents who are staying in their homes, but the schools reopened in time after the holiday of March 23.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with intensive contact tracking, restrictions on travel abroad, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent restrictions, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have carried out more tests, in relation to the number of deaths, have much lower fatality rates, probably because these countries have more capacity to detect people who have only mild symptoms or who do not have symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to perform tests and that have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to any of the 16 WHO reference laboratories to perform confirmatory tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 are in North America and 1 are in Australia.
In the following table, the "Positive as % of evidence" column is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that only carries out tests on people entering hospitals will have a higher positive number as a percentage of evidence that a country that carries out tests on all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, is the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the action of washing hands in order to eliminate dirt, fat, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
The washing of hands with soap constantly in certain "critical mothers" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through faecal-oral.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or common cold, for example, if their hands are not washed before touching the eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five critical moments during the day in which it is important to wash hands with soap include: before and after the defect, after cleaning a child's neck or changing clothes, before feeding a child, before and before and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
If there is no water or soap, hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after preparing the meals.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing clothes or cleaning up a kid who used the bathroom.
After sounding the nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, food for animals or animal waste.
Hand medical hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before taking medicines or medical care may prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to eliminate the pathogens (bacterials, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause a disease) from the hands and the chemical substances that may cause damage or diseases.
This is particularly important for people who manipulate food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many benefits for health, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronary virus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the rate of child mortality in births at home.
A study conducted in 2013 showed that improvements in hand-washing practices can generate small improvements in the growth rate of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple changes in behaviour, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action may reduce the mortality rate by almost 50% for these diseases.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhoea episodes in a third part approximately, and this is similar to providing drinking water in low-income areas.
48% of the decreases in diarrhoea episodes can be related to the washing of hands with soap. The washing of hands with soap is the most effective and economical way to prevent acute diarrhea and respiratory infections, such as automatic behaviour adopted in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, an important acute respiratory disease, is the main cause of mortality in children under five years of age, and lives of an estimated 1.8 million children per year are collected.
Diarrhoea and joint pneumonia represent almost 3.5 million infant deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, converting hands to soap before eating and after using the bath in an untreated habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, which would reduce death by nearly half by diarrhoea and one quarter by acute respiratory infections.
In general, hand washing is integrated with other interventions in the field of hygiene as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Hand washing also protects against impetism, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that your frequent realization may cause skin damage due to skin resuscitation.
According to a Danish study conducted in 2012, excessive hands wash can cause skin infection causing pizza and causes skin to become known as an eczema of the hands or dermatitis of the hands, which is especially common in health workers.
Washing hands too often is also considered one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
There are five critical moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the oral-fealing transmission of the diseases: after using the bath (orion, defecating), after cleaning a child's neck (to change clothes), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
Other occasions in which a right hand washing technique is to be used to prevent the transmission of diseases include before and after treatment of a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or sounding the nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching trash.
In many countries, there is a low rate of hands washing with soap.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 concluded that, on average, 38.7% of families were using soap-hand washing. A 2014 study indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate with 97%; the United States was close to half with 77%; and China had the lowest rate with 23%. Currently, there are several methodologies for changing behaviour to increase the habit of washing hands with soap at critical times. Children's group washing at school at certain times of the day is an option in developing countries to incorporate hand washing in the behavior of children.
The "Essential Health Care Programme" implemented by the Department of Education of the Philippines is an example of action to promote children's health and education.
Disappear twice a year, as well as washing hands with soap every day, brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, are the basis of this national programme.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The elimination of the microorganisms in the skin improves by adding soap or detergents to the water.
The main action of soap and detergents is to reduce the barriers to solution and increase solubility.
The water alone is ineffective to clean the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, are not easily dissolved in the water.
However, a reasonable flow of water facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria acquired in previous uses.
Some studies that analyzed the transfer of contaminated solid soap have concluded that the transfer is unlikely, since the bacteria are infested with foam.
Even so, the CDCs say "it is preferable to use the liquid soap with controls for exemption that do not involve the use of hands."
Antibacterial soaps have been strongly promoted to a conscious public of health.
There is currently no evidence that the use of recommended disinfectants or antiseptics preserves organisms resistant to antibiotics by nature.
However, antibacterial jabons contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosane, which has an extensive list of strains of resistant organisms.
In this way, even if the antibacterial jabons do not preserve the strains resistant to antibiotics, they may not be as effective as they are promoted.
In addition to the surfactant agent that protects the skin, sophisticated formulae may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity and more conditioners for the skin (aloe vera, vitamins, mentol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon Public Health School indicated that common soaps are as effective as the antibacterial soaps for the consumer containing triclosane to prevent diseases and eliminate hand bacteria.
The pleasant hot water to wash your hands is not enough to remove bacteria.
The bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, the tibia jabonous water is more effective than the cold jabonous water to eliminate natural oils that retain land and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using tibia water has no effect on reducing the microbial load in the hands.
A hand disinfectant or hand antiseptic is a waterless agent for hand hygiene.
At the end of 1990 and in the first part of the 21st century, the waterless and alcohol-free hand hygiene agents (also known as a hand-based alcohol-based solution, an antiseptic hand-to-hand solution or hand-to-hand disinfectants) began to acquire popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the effect of alcohol recovery.
Adding dilute hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing between 60 % and 95 % alcohol eliminate germs effectively.
Alcohol-based rotary disinfectants eliminate bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (SARM and ELV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, VSR, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based rotary disinfectants containing 70 % of alcohol eliminate 99.97 % (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99 % to 99.999 % (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand disinfectants are practically ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Enough solution should be used for antiseptic hands or alcohol-based to rot, such as to moisten or cover completely both hands.
The palm and back of both hands, between the fingers and the ends of all fingers, are flogged for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is followed.
The fingers should also be washed well, rubbed in both palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend hand washing before hand disinfectants to rub, especially when hands are clearly dirty.
The increased use of these agents is based on their ease of use and on the rapid elimination activity of micro-organisms; however, they should not be used as replacement of the appropriate washing of hands unless there is water or soap available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based hand disinfectants can dry the skin, unless emulsifiers or moisturizers are added for the skin to the formula.
The effect of alcohol drying can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based decontaminations containing emulsifiers caused a significantly lower irritation and dryness of the skin than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic dermatitis by contact, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or the additives present in alcohol-based solutions to rot are very rare.
The lowest tendency to cause contact irritation dermatitis was attractive compared to hand washing with water and soap.
Despite its effectiveness, waterless agents do not remove the organic matter from their hands, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as water and soap to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain in the hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand disinfectants depends largely on the ingredients and the formula, in addition historically, has been much lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based solutions to rot.
More recently, the formulas that use benzalconium chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and use ash or land instead.
Censorship or land may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if land or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms, this may increase the spread of diseases rather than decrease them.
Like soap, ashes are also a disinfectant agent, as in contact with water form an alkaline solution.
WHO recommended using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when no soap is available.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent the transmission of diseases includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended because containers with stuck water may be contaminated, while the water temperature appears to make no difference.
Swallow your hands to form foam with a generous amount of soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
The soap removes germs from the skin, and studies indicate that people usually wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Pull back for at least 20 seconds.
Restoration creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and restricts more germs during longer periods.
Drain well with running water.
Squeeze in a container can contaminate your hands again.
Dry with a clean towel or let the air dry.
Wet and wet hands become more easily contaminated. The parts that are most often forgotten are the thumb, the doll, the areas between the fingers and under the nails
The artificial nails and the enamelled nails can accommodate microorganisms.
Humidant lotion is often recommended to prevent hands from being dried; dry skin can cause skin damage that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
Several economic options can be used to facilitate hand washing when there is no running water or soap, for example, watering from a well or a well with suitable holes or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations where there is a limited supply of water (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "house scratches" and other economic options.
A home grip is a simple technology that consists of using a suspended jar of a soda and a stick with the foot to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a bar soap.
The effective drying of hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective drying form in public bathrooms.
More and more research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper shoe industry association, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and more modern hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the hot air dryer, it was detected that the total amount of bacteria increased, on average, 194 % in fingertips and 254 % in palms.
Drying with the air churn dryer resulted in an average increase in the total amount of bacteria of 42 % in fingers and 15 % in palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total amount of bacteria on average decreased by 76% in fingernails and 77% in palms. Scientists also carried out tests to determine whether there was a cross-contamination potential for other users of the bathroom and the bathroom as a result of each type of drying method.
The air churning dryer, which blows air from unit to unit at speeds, as stated, of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to blow the micro-organisms of the hands and unit and, potentially, to contaminate other users of the bathroom and the bathroom at a distance of up to 2 metres.
The use of a hot air-hand dryer spread the micro-organisms to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produd und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes were observed in the bacterial count after drying hands:
There are many manufacturers of different hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to the drying with paper towels.
Washing hands with hand disinfectant towels is an alternative during travel, when there is no water or soap.
The alcohol-based hand disinfectant shall contain at least 60 % of alcohol.
The washing of the hands of doctors became mandatory long after Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) for disease prevention in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide comments to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
A study verified a decrease in the rate of infection with its use.
The washing of the hands of the doctors is done for at least 15 seconds, with plenty of water and soap or gel to form foam and restrict all parts of the hands.
Hands should be restricted together by intertwining their fingers.
If there are residue under the nails, a breast cap can be used to remove them.
Since germs can stay in the water in their hands, it is important to swallow them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from getting contaminated again by those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the medical care environment is to eliminate and avoid transmission of pathogenic microorganisms ("germen").
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the lack of hand washing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, where many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmit microorganisms.
A study showed that the correct washing of hands and other simple procedures could reduce the rate of blood flow infections related to catheter by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a paper showing hand washing and standard hand milling in the medical care sectors.
The preliminary version of the guide for the hygiene of the organization can also be found on its website so that the public can comment.
Whitby and others carried out a relevant review.
Commercial devices may measure and verify the hygiene of their hands if the demonstration of compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
before aseptic work and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (medicineal jabons or antibacterials) gives you the possibility of eliminating the hand washing agent.
This elimination may be necessary before surgery or in environments in which antibiotics-resistant organisms are very common. To wash hands before surgery, it is necessary to have a grip that can be opened and closed without touching hands, a little chlorhexidine or iodine for washing, sterilised towels to dry hands after washing, a sterilized brush to shave and another sterilized instrument to clean under the nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires the washing of hands and forearms up to the tail, in general, for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When ingested, the water of the forearms should be prevented from returning to the hands.
After washing, the hands dry with a sterilized cloth and a surgical bat is placed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after taking care of sick people.
In order to control the infections caused by staphylocococcal in hospitals, it has been demonstrated that the highest benefit of hand cleaning is in the first 20 % of the wash and that very little additional benefit is obtained when the frequency of hand hygiene increases by more than 35 %.
The common soap wash produces more than triple incidence of bacterial infections transmitted to food compared to the antibacterial soap wash. When comparing hand wash with an alcohol-based solution with hand wash with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds each, it was observed that the booze with alcohol reduced the contamination of bacteria by 26 % more than the antibacterial soap.
However, water and soap are more effective to reduce the influenza virus A H1N1 and Clostridium thickets difficult to deal with than alcohol-based hand disinfectants. Interventions to improve the hygiene of hands in health care centres may include training staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of hand disinfectant based on alcohol and written and oral reminders to staff.
It is necessary to investigate more about which of these interventions are the most effective in the different health care environments.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an economic and fundamental tool to achieve good health and even good food.
However, the lack of reliable supply of water, soap or facilities to wash hands in homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal conduct of hand washing.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, there are very few grips to wash hands close to public or private portraits, although there are economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can also be the result of rooted habits rather than of lack of soap or water.
The promotion of hand washing with soap can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and bring about a change of behaviour in the long-term population.
In order for this to work effectively, it is necessary to follow up and evaluate.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, it was observed that community approaches are effective to increase hand washing in PRBMs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of promoting hand washing in schools is UNICEF's three-star approach, which encourages schools to take simple and economic measures to ensure that students wash hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When minimum standards are reached, schools can eventually pass one to three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the hand-washing campaigns that are being carried out to reduce diseases and child mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness campaign that seeks to achieve a change in behavior. As a result of the pandemic of coronavirus 2019-2020, UNICEF has stimulated the creation of an emoji for handwashing.
Few studies have considered the overall profitability of hand washing in developing countries in relation to avoided AVADs.
However, an analysis indicates that promoting soap wash is significantly more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of washing hands for human health, especially for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who have just given birth or soldiers to hospitals, was first recognized by two pioneers in the middle of the 20th century: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English, the "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant smells called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food-borne diseases and health-related infections led the United States Disease Control and Prevention Centres to promote hand hygiene more actively as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 made many countries more aware of the importance of washing their hands with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters were hung with "correct hand washing techniques" along with the bathrooms of public bathrooms and the bathrooms of office buildings and airports.
The phrase "wash your hands" is a statement that you do not want to take care of something or share the complicity of something.
It has its origin in the Bible passage of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands before the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a much wider phrase of use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, which represented her conscience of guilt over the crimes she had committed and had led her husband to commit.
It has also been proven that after remembering or reflecting on non-ethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value the elements more for hand washing.
Moreover, those people who have allowed their hands to be washed after such reflection have less chance of getting involved in other compensatory "cleaning" actions, as a volunteer.
Religions recommend the washing of hands for hygienic and symbolic purposes. The washing of hands symbolically, with water, but without soap, is part of the washing of ritual hands in many religions, such as Bahaism, Hinduism, Tablet and Netilate yadayim in Judaism, the washing of Christianity and the wudu in Islam. Religions also recommend the washing of hygienic hands, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam force hands to be washed after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam force hands to be washed before and after each meal.
Risk controls at the workplace before the COVID-19
Risk controls at the workplace with COVID-19 refer to the application of hygiene and occupational safety methodologies in risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate risk controls at the workplace depend on the workplace and the job and are based on a risk assessment of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of workers who may be willing to contract COVID-19.
According to the United States Security and Occupational Health Administration (OSHA), work at a lower risk of exposure has a minimum working contact with the public and workmates, for which measures to prevent basic infections, including hand washing, the recommendation to workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene standards and the maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Average exposure risk work includes those requiring frequent or close contact with persons who are unknown or suspected of having COVID-19, but who may be infected by the current Community transmission or by an international journey.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a lot of concentration of people and some large retail selling environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include high-efficiency air filter ventilation, protective cover and individual protection equipment available if there is a person with COVID-19.
OIOS considers that workers in health care and funeral services, exposed to persons who know or are suspected of having COVID-19, have a high exposure risk, which increases very high if they perform procedures that can generate aerosols in persons who know or are suspected of having COVID-19 or taking or manipulating samples of these persons.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as ventilation rooms with negative pressure, and individual protection equipment suitable for the work activity.
COVID-19 outbreaks may have several consequences in the workplace.
Workers may miss work because they are sick, because they have to look after others or because they are afraid of the possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of what goods are demanded and in terms of the means of acquiring such goods (such as buying in hours that are not peak, by sending them to home or by window from the car).
Finally, shipments of articles from geographical areas seriously affected by COVID-19 could be interrupted. A plan to prepare and respond to infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address the risk levels related to various workplaces and activities, including exposure sources, the risk factors arising from domestic and community environments and the risk factors of individual workers, such as old age or chronic medical disorders.
They also describe the controls necessary to address these risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Preparation and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of the response to a outbreak include reducing the transmission among staff members, protecting those at greater risk of adverse health complications, maintaining trade operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located affects the measures taken.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a widely used framework for hygiene and occupational safety to classify risk controls according to their effectiveness.
If the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by the administrations and, lastly, individual protection teams.
Engineering controls involve isolation of workers from the dangers associated with work without resorting to the behaviour of workers and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in labour policies or procedures requiring action by the worker or employer.
Individual protection equipment is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exhibitions.
All types of individual protective equipment must be selected depending on the danger to the worker, placed as appropriate (e.g. breathing agents), used appropriately and systematically, checked frequently, received maintenance, replaced if necessary and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of properly to avoid contamination.
According to the United States Health and Occupational Safety Administration (OSHA), work with a lower risk of exposure has a minimum working relationship with the public and workmates.
The measures to prevent basic infections recommended for all workplaces include deep and frequent washing of hands, the recommendation for workers to stay at home if they are sick, the standards of respiratory hygiene that include tossing and sneezing, the provision of paper panels and containers for waste, preparation for teleworking or shifts if necessary, the deterrence of workers from using external tools and equipment, and the maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The immediate identification and isolation of people who may be infected is a fundamental measure to protect workers, clients, visitors and others at the workplace.
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that employees who have acute respiratory symptoms stay in their homes until they stop having fever, signs of fever and any other symptoms during, at least, 24 hours without taking medication to relieve symptoms or reduce fever; that disease licensing policies be flexible and allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family, and that employees know these policies.
According to OSHA, medium exposure risk work includes those who require frequent or close contact at less than six feet (1.8 m) with persons who do not know or suspect that they have COVID-19, but who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the Community transmission of the moment around the company's location, or because the person made a recent international journey to a place with generalized transmission of COVID-19.
These include workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a lot of concentration of people and some large retail sales environments. Engineering controls for this group and the higher risk groups include installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation rates, installation of physical barriers such as the protective roofs of transparent plastic and placing a service window for the customer to ask for from the car. Administrative controls for this group and the higher risk groups include recommending sick workers, replacing the presenceal meetings with high-efficiency communications, setting up escalated shifts, suspending the journeys that are not essential to the locations with existing vents of COVID-19, developing plans for the service service provider that he or she or she/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/who/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he/he//he/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// or/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// fallen box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box box
Workers of this risk group are rarely required to use respiratory agents.
If a person is sick on a plane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from the others at a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to care for the sick person and offering a mask to the sick person or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with paper straps when coughing or tingling.
Cabin crew should use disposable surgical gloves to care for a sick passenger or to play corporal fluids or possibly contaminated surfaces and, perhaps, individual protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
In the case of commercial navigation, such as cruises and other ships carrying passengers, risk controls include delaying the journey by disease, self-disposal and immediately inform the medical centre on board if someone has fever or other symptoms while on board.
The ideal thing is that medical control is carried out in the isolated person's cabin. In the case of schools and child care centres, CDCs recommend short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of the community transmission.
When Community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as canceling excursions, assemblies and other mass meetings, such as physical or choir education classes or meals in the dining room, increasing the space between infants, scaling up the time of entry and exit, limiting visits that are not essential and using a separate place for the health room for children with flu symptoms.
When there is a significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, it may be considered to extend the cancellation of the classes. For police personnel carrying out daily routine activities, the CDC considers that the immediate risk to health is low.
Officers of the police forces are recommended to contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 who follow the same standards as emergency medical technicians, including the use of personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during a detention, workers must clean and disinfect their work belts and their equipment with an aerosol or household cleaning towels before using them again and following the standard operating procedure for the retention and disposal of the personal protective equipment and the maintenance and washing of the clothes.
OSHA considers that certain health and morgue workers are in high or very high exposure risk categories.
Among the high-risk exposure work are those of delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspicions of COVID-19.
These become very high exposure risk work if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspicions of COVID-19 or if they take or manipulate samples of these patients.
Some aerosol generation procedures are intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive sampling.
High-risk exposure morgue works include those in which workers are involved in the preparation of the corpses of persons with COVID-19 or suspected that they might have it at the time of death; they become very high exposure risk if they perform autopsies. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19, even when they are performed with aerosol generation procedures.
Specialized ventilation with negative pressure may be appropriate in some medical and morgue settings.
Samples should be manipulated by taking precautions at Biosafety Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering different waiting rooms be separated according to whether or not they can have COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protection equipment, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those who work at a distance of up to 6 feet from patients who have been infected or suspected of having been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and those who carry out aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, N95 respirators should be used with filter mask approved by NIOSH or higher in the context of a written comprehensive respiratory program that includes tests for adjustment, training and medical examinations.
Other types of masks can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of protective monkeys, since COPID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one that is transmitted by body fluids.
WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for the classification staff of patients entering.
For those who take respiratory samples of patients with COVID-19, give them attention or carry them without conducting aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, facial glasses or protector, bats and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is carried out, the surgical mask must be replaced by a fan N95 or FFP2.
Because the provision of personal protective equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need to use them, replacing them with telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting the access to a patient's room with COVID-19 only to those involved in direct care, the use of a single mask without removing it while paying attention to several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protective equipment and discouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic individuals.

This month, we meet in unique circumstances.
The epidemic of COVID-19 highlights our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have with each other.
The challenges we face have no precedents, but we know that our best response is in the empathy, cooperation and overall Community construction that is the core of this organization.
The friendship and concern that we have seen among all our companions in e-mail messages, calls and conversations is a great validation of how incredible the people with whom we are lucky to work are.
I could not feel greater gratitude and pride that all of you are my companions.
Last week, someone shared with me the appreciation I felt for our work.
I was reminded how important it is for the world to be able to go to Wikipedia at this moment and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible, whether by maintaining the sites in operation, helping our fellow citizens to receive their payment or to keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides today more than ever.
This is a moment in which not only what we do but how we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in this, from this next week, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and our timetables
As Robyn mentioned earlier, team C met last night to talk about our approach and our timetable for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we consider what we thought would be an appropriate response to what we are facing and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization at this time.
To a greater extent, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to slow down, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors and contract workers:
our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until next notice.
We are not declaring a holiday; if you can work on a more normal schedule, this would be of great benefit to the mission.
However, the world is currently an uncertain place, and whether you have to take care of your loved ones, shopping or going to the doctor, our priority is your well-being.
We're not taking account of your hours.
If he's sick, don't work.
Although it should not be necessary to say so, we say so.
You do not need to apply for sick leave or paid free time; just inform your manager and help your team review the calendars and schedules to ensure that the key areas of the work are covered.
(If you receive a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, notify Bryan, of T&C Operations, so that T&C can help with the support and ensure that management is at the same time in its situation).
The people I work for an hour will receive the full payment.
As we have said, we renew our commitment to our contractors and staff members working per hour.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal hours worked under normal circumstances.
This applies also if you are sick and cannot work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly gratifying, especially in these times.
Again, it is about your personal care.
We ask them to communicate with their manager so that we know what to expect and can adapt properly.
Some work is considered essential.
There are some things we need to keep doing.
The site Trust Engineering Teams, Human Resources Operations, Trust and Security and Funding Retrieval, among other things, perform a critical work that could require additional support.
We will start a process with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and modify our approach in order to support what is essential for our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all focus on the most essential projects.
Reduced speed today won't hurt us tomorrow.
We don't plan to "double the hours to keep us up" when the pandemic is over.
I will not be expected to work extra hours to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that the circumstances have changed and we will work to set new objectives and deadlines when appropriate.
What happens to the APP, or Annual Planning?
In order to adjust to our new reality and daily working hours expectations, we plan to adjust the timetable for the delivery of our Annual Planning 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan to allocate more time to the budget so that employees can prioritise critical work, personal care and care of loved ones as we adapt to the needs of those who need or want to work with a reduced schedule over the next few weeks.
This extension of our schedule greatly reduces the current planning and pressure burden throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform the delegates and the teams of the next steps we have only one confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for their leadership in this situation.
Status, presentation and cleaning of the office
Last week we realized that one of our partners in the San Francisco office might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we hire an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution for hospital use to disinfect all the surfaces, in addition to the reception and lifts that go to our floor.
The building has adopted its own duty protocol, using products that support the safety of its occupants.
We feel confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has shared its protocol for COVID-19 with us and all staff members in DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office has moved its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with the patterns shared with San Francisco.
As some of our companions in New York City already know, we also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing, but they may be delayed.
Some of our partners work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely since then know that this mode requires adaptation, so they provide the following suggestions:
Limits the duration of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If more prolonged sessions are required, consider how to section them over a period of several days.
It clearly defines the meeting with a list of topics and sends the reading materials in advance.
Adopt the use of the video by default, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and connection.
Design a leader to modulate each meeting, a person who controls the questions in the chat and list of speakers, and someone who helps take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
Send an e-mail message to technical support if you need comfortable earphones.
Use the welfare refund for refrigeration.
Join the #remotes channel in Slack to talk to your partners about distributed work
RR. HH. Operations team is analyzing the guidelines on ergonomics based on web seminars to support the increase of the work distributed throughout the Foundation.
Last week we are asking all beneficiaries of Community grants to cancel the public events financed by Wikimedia, such as the editions, until WHO declares the end of the pandemic.
We informed you that we understood that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could make it impossible to fulfil part of the activities agreed for the grant and that there would be no penalty for delaying or modifying those objectives.
This week we will follow up with additional guidelines in Wikimania and other Community and regional thematic conferences.
The general feeling of the community at the global level seems to be, in part, sadness over the interruption and, in part, relief from the clarity and ability to focus on its own communities, both that of Wikimedia and others.
In the future, CRT will be working to establish a page in Meta-Wiki in order to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Keep in touch with the issues of COVID-19
We will send you an invitation through your calendars for the next Thursday, 14:00 h, universal time coordinated 07:00 h, Pacific time, for a special meeting of staff.
We will take this opportunity to share additional news, answer your questions and spend time connecting with each other.
We're together in this and we're available to help out in the way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find information about this email message and all essential additional information related to COVID-19 in Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages up to date and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff living in countries that are currently largely affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, an important workflow, any coverage problem or anything with which you may need help, don't hesitate to notify CRT and work with them.
We are here to help provide support and function as a link when necessary.
If they have confidential or sensitive issues, they send an e-mail to Bryan Judan, Director of Global Operations of RR. HH.
None of these changes should be considered a abandonment of our work and our obligations.
Instead, I am grateful that, at this point, our work and our obligations should probably be adapted in a way that had not happened before.
These are the measures we believe necessary to support each other in order to continue working, to give our movement the necessary support and to give the world the service it trusts in.
Our planned work will continue there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and make room for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and possibly in the coming months.
We need all of you to make this possible and, therefore, we need you to take care of and care for your families so that they can be in the best possible state when the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the Leaderacgo team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Angiotensin 2 (ECA2) converting enzyme is an enzyme that adheres to the external surface (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, the heart, kidneys and intestines.
ECA2 reverses the angiotensin converting enzyme (ECA) activity by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), which makes it a therapeutic Diana for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also serves as an entry point for some coronavirus cells.
The human version of the enzyme is generally called hECA2.
The convertible enzyme of angiotensin 2 is a metaloenzyme containing zinc and is found on the surface of endothelial cells and other types.
ECA2 protein contains a N-terminal domain of peptidease M2 and a C-terminal domain of the renal transporter of colectrin amino acids.
ECA2 is a single type I membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed to the surface of the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is eliminated from the transmemoral domain by another enzyme known as shedasa and, as a result, the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually is excreted by the urine.
ECA2 is present in most organs: ECA2 is primarily attached to the cell membrane of Type II alveolar cells of the lungs, to the enterocytes of the small intestine, to the venous arterial and endothelial cells and to the arterial cells of the smooth muscle of most organs.
The MARN expression of ECA2 is also found in the brain cortex, the stretched body, the hypothalamus and the brain trunk.
The main function of ECA2 is to counter ECA.
The ECA emits the hormone of angiotensin I and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictor.
In turn, ECA2 emits the aminocarboxyl-terminal phenylalanine of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Is-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis to form vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Is-Pro-OH).
ECA2 may also emit several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradiquinine, appelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and grelin.
ECA2 also regulates the trafficking of membranes of the transporter of neutral amino acids SLC6A19 and has been associated with Hartnup’s disease.
As a transmembranal protein, ECA2 serves as the main entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus causing SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19).
More specifically, the association of the S1 spore protein from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the enzyme domain of ECA2 on the surface of the cells results in endocytosis and virus transfer along with the enzyme to the endosomals within the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of the S protein by the guest TMPRSS2 protease serum, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as possible therapy. This has led to certain assumptions that reducing ECA2 levels in cells could help to combat infection.
However , a number of professional associations and regulators have recommended continued CCA and standard BRA inhibitor therapy .
A systematic meta-analysis review published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ECA inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction of 34% of the risk of pneumonia compared to control cases".
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients who received treatment with ECA inhibitors and who had a higher risk of pneumonia, in particular those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ECA inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were not so solid for the overall risk of pneumonia."
The recombinant human ECA2 (rhECA2) appears to be a new therapy for acute pulmonary injury and seems to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in infants with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolisaccharides.
The mean life of rhECA2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the start of action is 30 minutes in addition to the 24 hour duration of effect.
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 could be a promising medicine for those with intolerance to the classic renin-angiotensin inhibitors (SRA inhibitors) or in diseases with high circulating angiotensin II. RhECA2 infusion was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory disease syndrome.
The COVID-19 applications are mobile devices software applications designed to help with tracking contacts in response to the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") that might have been in contact with a infected person.
Various applications were developed or proposed with the official support of the government in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracking applications.
Privacy-related concerns have been raised, in particular, with regard to systems based on the tracking of the geographical location of users of the application.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as the use of Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly on their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, has implemented an application that allows citizens to verify whether they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is already in use in over 200 Chinese cities. Singapore is using an application called TraceTogether.
The application was developed by a local IT community, launched as an open code application and will be handed over to the government. "StopKorona!" was launched in North Macedonia, a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a rapid response to the health authorities.
The implementation was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the application was waiting for the approval of Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government informed that the tracking of contacts was at an advanced stage of development and that it would be available for implementation in the coming weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether application and the Singapore BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to introduce a geoperimeter application for patients living in Moscow who have been diagnosed with COVID-19, designed to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of Safety Engineering at Cambridge University, presented several potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and possible lack of effectiveness if the adoption of the application is limited to only a small part of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of deceptive or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related applications in its App Store to "official" or trusted organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance through the applications of the coronavirus and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat occurs.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations submitted a communication to require limits on this kind of surveillance.
Organizations established eight conditions for government projects:
monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extensions of monitoring and monitoring would have to have extinction clauses;
the use of data should be limited to objectives related to COVID-19;
Security and anonymity should be protected and there should be evidence of such protection;
Digital surveillance should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;
any data exchange with third parties should be defined in the laws;
protection against abuse should be implemented and citizens' rights to respond to such abuse should be established;
The significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalized groups, will be mandatory. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter without Borders, RSF) of Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from its operating systems when no longer required.
In some countries, a network-based location tracking was used instead of applications, eliminating both the need to download an application as well as the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw data from locations present potential problems of significant privacy.
However, it is not necessary for all systems with central servers to have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems that use central servers only for intercommunication have been established (see the following section).
In South Korea, a system that is not based on an application was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and combined them to generate warnings through text messages for potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert you about possible contacts, the government has also made the location information available to the public, something that is allowed due to large-scale changes to the privacy laws of the information after the outbreak of MES in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, considered using centralised and privacy protection systems.
As of 6 April 2020, the details have not yet been published.
The tracking of contacts with privacy protection is a well-established concept, with a large number of published investigations that are at least up to 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on respectable privacy solutions, such as low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) use to register the proximity of a user to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both centralized and decentralised approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include the decentralized proximity tracking to preserve privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCNs, previously known as contact event numbers, CENs) and the protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact tracking for privacy protection (PACTs), among others.
In these protocols, personal identification data never come out of the device and all matching occurs on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of techniques that protect privacy when collecting and using data from location or intersection of routes to track the spread of the COVID-19.
It is based on the research of the technical report "Applications out of control: how to maintain personal privacy during an epidemic", published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies that was also originally based on the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of those data.
On 5 April 2020, several groups united around what was essentially the same approach and with highly consistent protocols formed the World TCN Coalition with the aim of reducing fragmentation and allowing the global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, a key aspect for broad adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the code of the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government application.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google, companies that control iOS and Android mobile platforms announced an initiative for tracking contacts that, as they ensured, would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and encryption of privacy protection.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, it is intended to implement the system in three stages:
implementation of tools for governments to create official coronavirus tracking applications that protect privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to address the problems of persistent adoption and monitoring by distributing, first, the system through operating system updates and then removing them in the same way as the threat has passed.
b'Reperfilation (also known as repositioning or therapeutic change) is the re-adjustment of an approved drug for the treatment of a disease that is not the one for which it was originally developed.
This is online with the scientific research currently seeking to develop safe and effective treatments for the COVID-19.
Other research lines include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and convalescent plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemomodulatory proteins, each of which has multiple binding sites.
Analysis of these union sites provides a reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important Diana proteins of SARS-CoV-2, there is the protease similar to the papaine, the polymerase RNA directed by the RNA, the helicase, the S protein and the ADP ribophosphate.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several compounds of medical interest that then optimized and analyzed to identify the similarity of their main chain with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study and recommend it for the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antipaludic medicine that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine-related would be among the four drugs to be studied in the clinical trial Solidarity.
The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that the tests of the state of New York with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate by an urgent authorisation (U.S.).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised according to an US only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
CDCs said that "the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors have said they use the drug when "there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
At the University of Duke and the University of Oxford, large studies are under way.
The NYU's Langone Medical Faculty is conducting a test on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen gave negative on an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir, while the other half received omifenevir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence supporting the drug is limited and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug to Japan for its reservations and that it would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to the Trump Administration on the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in serious cases of the disease if the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or they are trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antibodies, concluded that "there was no benefit seen".
Drugs were designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by joining the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that joins the SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, there have been criticisms about the allocation of resources to the rehabilitation of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity test.
Remedesivir was created and developed by Gilead Science as treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remedesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against multiple filvirus, nemovirus, paramixovirus and coronavirus.
An antiviral treatment problem is the development of resistance through mutations that may result in a more serious disease and transmission.
Some initial studies prior to the trials suggest that remedisive may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two conducted by hospitals at Cleveland University; one for people with a moderate disease and the other for those with a more severe disease.
There are three clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for people hospitalized and severely affected by COVID-19; two placebo-controlled trials (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled one (Italy).
The state of New York began testing with azithromycin antibiotics on 24 March 2020.
Japan's National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial with Teijin Alvesco (cyclesonide), an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma, as treatment for asymptomatic patients infected by the new coronary virus.
An angiotensin converting enzyme form 2, a phase II test is under way and 200 patients hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria will be enrolled to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is listing 6,000 adults 40 years of age and older with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant women who are breast-feeding or who do not have an affective contraceptive are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being evaluated in Italy.
The low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency published guidelines on its use.
On 14 April, a multicenter study was announced in Italy with 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium at preventive and therapeutic doses.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are paying great attention to the re-adjustment of antiviral drugs developed for previous outbreaks of the SROM, SRAG and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese patterns
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
These are some treatments that have been identified for possible re-adjustments for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (blocks IL-6 receptor): approved by China.

b'A vaccine against COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many ongoing attempts to develop that vaccine.
By the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was not expected that there would be a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, in less than 18 months.
In April, five possible vaccines were in Phase I safety studies.
The COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
An important outbreak spread throughout the world in 2020, triggering considerable investments and research activities to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use the genomes published to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Established in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technological platforms were being investigated and developed in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The following are among the main platforms that went to Phase I safety studies:
nucleic acid (ADN and RNA) (phase I developer and possible vaccine: Modern, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologicals, adenovirus type 5)
According to CEP scientists in April, 115 possible vaccines are at the initial stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and 37 others are announced, but with little information available (it is assumed to be planning or developing).
A Phase I or II test is carried out prior to safety and immunogenicity tests, usually random, is controlled by placebo and is carried out on several sites, while determining more precise and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease, while controlling the adverse effects that occur with the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active development vaccines (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in human evaluation (continued in the "preclinical investigation").
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a vaccine with molecular subjection that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune response.
Around 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work in a vaccine and hopes that human testing will begin in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Center for Control and Prevention of Diseases of China on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Around 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun developing a vaccine.
Janssen is co-development of an oral vaccine with his biotech partner, Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergency BioSolutions announced a manufacturing association with Vaxart for vaccine development.
OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document with a design for a vaccine with a technology similar to that used in the treatment of cancer neogenesis vaccines.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the vaccine synthesis and that the tests were beginning.
On 27 February 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that a project was beginning to create a li-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested in humans "within 90 days".
On 5 March 2020, the University of Washington, San Luis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command at Fort Detrick and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research at Silver Spring, both in the west of Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
About 10 March 2020, Emergency Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for a clinical trial and phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that it was working with 11 isolates and that, although moving fast, it would take at least one year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in the city of Quebec, Quebec, reported the development of a particle similar to coronavirus with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The possible vaccine is in the laboratory research phase and human testing is expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "great amounts of money for exclusive access to a vaccine against COVID-19", before which the German Government complained.
On 17 March 2020, the U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced an association with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an ARNm-based vaccine.
The potential vaccine based on RNAm BNT162 is currently on preliminary testing and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will have the results of the preclinical trials in April 2020 and that the human testing of the possible final vaccine could begin in the fall.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparation (CEPI) announced an investment of USD 4.9 million in a research alliance of a vaccine against COVID-19, including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Viena, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of CEPI for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to USD 29 million.
The other CEPI partners for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are Modern, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford and University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists started testing in animals of six possible vaccines.
Researchers at the Imperial College in London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a RNA vaccine with self-replication against the COVID-19.
The possible vaccine developed within 14 days of receiving the Chinese sequence.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced funding of CAD 275 million for 96 medical research projects to counter COVID-19, including a large number of possible vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
More or less at the same time, the Canadian Government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, with plans to create a "national vaccine bank" with several new vaccines that could be used if another outbreak of coronavirus occurs.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical College announced PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19, in mice and said that "the S1 subunit vaccines administered by MNA received powerful responses from specific antibodies to antigens (in rats) that were evident two weeks after vaccination".
In Canada, on 16 April 2020, the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Waterloo announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a probable nasal sprayer.
Using bacteria, DNA will be designated to replicate within the human bacteria and produce toxic particles similar to the virus, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities gathered resources to access IBM supercomputers, along with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have non-specific effects.
This means that they can benefit beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to register 4170 health workers.
The vaccines that are developing may not be safe or effective.
Initial investigations to assess the effectiveness of vaccines with specific animal models of COVID-19, such as the transgenic mouse expressed by ECA2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, demonstrate the need to include level 3 biosecurity content measures for the handling of live viruses and with international coordination to ensure standardised safety procedures.
Vaccines against SRAG and SROM have been tested in non-human animal models.
By 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SRAG that has proved to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medications to treat SRAG was a priority for Governments and public health agencies around the world.
When the SROM was generalized, it was believed that the existing research on SRAG could be a useful model for developing vaccines and treatments against the infection by MERS-CoV.
In March 2020, one SROM vaccine (based on DNA) completed phase I clinical trials, the other three were in progress, all of which were viral vector vaccines, two adenovirus vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications promoted a conspiracy theory according to which the virus caused by COVID-19 was known and there was already a vaccine.
The patents quoted by various social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus, such as the coronavirus of the SRAG.
b'Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by acute respiratory syndrome severe 2 (SARS-COV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of appetite and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can vary between two and fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organism insufficiency.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread among people during close contact, usually through gouts that occur in the cough, cough, or speak.
Although these drops occur when exhalation occurs, they usually fall to the floor or surface, instead of being contagious in long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, although the spread is also possible before symptoms and in late stages of the disease appear. The standard method for diagnosis is the reaction in the polymerase chain with inverse real-time transcription (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal hisopate.
The use of masks is recommended for those suspected of having the virus and its caregivers.
The recommendations on the use of masks for the general public vary. Some authorities recommend that they not be used, others recommend that they be used, while others require their use.
There is currently no specific antiviral vaccine or treatment against COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
Those infected by the virus may be asymptomatic or have symptoms similar to those of the flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty walking and face or blue lips. If these symptoms are present, it is recommended to seek medical attention immediately.
It is less common to observe symptoms in the upper respiratory tract, such as rash, nasal discharge and throat pain.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been identified in variable percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented breast oppression and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multi-organism insufficiency, and death.
This is called incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period usually ranges from five to six days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of people with symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people infected who do not have symptoms is unknown for the time being and is being studied. The Centres for Control and Prevention of Korean Diseases (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in daily cases on 1 April. Of the 166 infections of that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when the test was performed.
Both the spout and the saliva can have large viral loads.
Speaking aloud frees more drops than when speaking with a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering the mouth of the cough can make the drops travel 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually air-transmission, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission through biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the passage outside the bedrooms of people gave positive in viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (RCP) may cause air-suspension of respiratory secretions and consequently air transmission.
Although there are concerns about the possibility of spreading by the actions, it is believed that the risk is low. The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; although the spread is possible before the onset of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that, although it is not quite clear the ease with which it is spreading, a person usually infected with two or three more. The virus survives hours or days on the surface.
In particular, the virus was detected for one day in the cartridge, up to three days in the plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours in products with 99 % copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
The soap and detergent are also effective if used properly. The soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus and disable it, as well as remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzoalconium chloride and chlorohexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, samples of saliva were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second test day.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronary virus, which was isolated for the first time by three people with pneumonia connected to an acute respiratory disease group in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related nature-related coronaviruses.
Outside of the human body, the domestic soap kills the virus, as it returns its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs of the COVID-19, because the virus enters the host cells by converting angiotensin type I 2 enzyme (ECA2), which is more abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spicula" (peplomer) to connect with ECA2 and enter the host cell.
In 12% of the infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, acute cardiac injury was identified, which is more frequent in serious illness.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease development, but acute myocardial injury may be associated with heart ECA2 receptors.
ECA2 receptors have a high expression in the heart and participate in its operation.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was detected in patients with COVID-19 virus infections and may be associated with a prognosis. In the autopsys of people who died from COVID-19, diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) and inflammatory infiltrates with lymphocytes in the lungs were detected.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropics for epithelial cells expressing ECA2 from respiratory pathways, patients with COVID-19 severe have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was observed that GM-CSF pathogen secretaries T were associated with the recruitment of IL-6 secretors and a severe pulmonary pathology in patients with COVID-19.
In autopsies, lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported.
WHO has published several test protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase chain reaction with inverse real-time transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed in samples of the respiratory pathways obtained by a nasopharyngeal hisopate; however, samples of nasal or spouty hisopate may also be used.
Overall, the results are available within a few hours or two days.
Blood analysis can also be used, but two blood samples should be taken with two weeks of difference and the results have very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate the coronavirus strain and published the genetic sequence so that the world's laboratories could independently develop polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) to detect the virus infection.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and if the person was infected in the past) were being developed, but were not widely used.
Experience in China with evidence has shown that accuracy is only 60 to 70 %.
The FDA in the United States approved the first immediate diagnostic test on 21 March 2020 to use it for the end of that month. The diagnostic patterns published by Hospital Zhongnan at Wuhan University would suggest methods to detect infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multi-lobular glass opacitys with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common in the initial stages of the infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain, disordered emedrade pattern (lobular septal embolism with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear.
There are few data available on the microscopic lesions and the physiopathology of the COVID-19.
The main pathological results of autopsys are:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, hyperplasia of the neutrophils, atypically large neutrophils, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of giant cells with multiple nucleus
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudements.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxemia.
treatment pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (CID); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the possibility of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, washing hands with water and soap frequently for, at least, 20 seconds, having good breathing hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands.
CDCs recommend covering the mouth and nose with a torso or toss and, if there are no torso, use the inner part of the code.
Appropriate hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
CDCs have recommended the use of screen covers in public places, one of the reasons is to limit the transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Social distance strategies seek to reduce the contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling multiple public meetings.
Distance patterns also indicate that persons must maintain a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective medicine to prevent COVID-19. As there is not expected to be a vaccine until 2021, as soon as a key part to control COVID-19 is to try to prevent the epidemic peak, which is known as "planning the curve".
CDCs also recommend washing hands frequently with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when hands are clearly dirty, before eating and after sounding the nose, coughing or coughing.
They also recommend the use of an alcohol-based hand disinfectant that has a minimum of 60% of alcohol, but only if there is no water and soap available on time. For areas where hand disinfectants are not easy to achieve, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity results from ethanol or isopropanol.
The hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; "it is not an active substance for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are given support attention, which may include rehydration, oxygen therapy and treatment for other vital organs affected.
CDCs recommend that those suspected of having the virus use a simple mask.
Oxygenation by extracorporeal membrane (OMEC) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but the benefits are still being analysed.
To improve immunity, personal hygiene and lifestyle and healthy food have been recommended.
Support treatments can be useful for those with mild symptoms during the initial phase of the infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensiveists and neurologists in the U.S. have compiled the recommendations of several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020, there was no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the initial treatment of the symptoms, some medical professionals recommend the liketamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen.
Caution should be exercised to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care environments when procedures that may generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation, are carried out.
CDCs recommend health care professionals who take care of people with COVID-19 to place the patient in an air infection isolation zone (AIIR), as well as using standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions to avoid air transmission. CDCs highlight the guidelines for the use of personal protection equipment (EPP) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is an EPP bat, mask, protective antennas and medical gloves. When available, the breathers are preferred (instead of the masks).
The N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorized their use through an emergency use permit (U.S.).
They are designed to protect against particles that are in the air, such as dust, but it is not guaranteed the effectiveness against a specific biological agent that is not specified in the product indications.
Where no masks are available, CDCs recommend the use of protective scarves or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most COVID-19 cases are not serious enough to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but a percentage of cases are.
This type of respiratory support is actively being studied for people hospitalized with respiratory insufficiency related to COVIDA-19 and there is already some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal duct or positive bisection on respiratory pathways.
It is still not known whether either of these give the same benefit to people in a critical state.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to the high flow nasal channel. Serious cases are mainly reported in adults (the older than 60 years and, in particular, the older than 80 years).
Many developed countries do not have sufficient headbeds in hospitals, limiting the capacity of the health system to manage the sudden increase in serious cases of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% was admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30 % of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually transferred to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a patient with COVID-19 has acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and oxygenation is becoming more and more difficult.
Respirators that have different pressure control modes and PPTE are needed to maximize oxygen supply while minimizing the risk of pulmonary injury associated with the respiratory and neumothorax.
Older respirators may not count with high PPTE.
Research on possible treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remedyvir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new medicines may take up to 2021, several medicines that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced tests.
Antiviral medicines can be tested in people with severe disease.
WHO recommends that volunteers participate in tests on the effectiveness and safety of possible treatments. The FDA granted a temporary authorisation to plasma convalescent as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is at serious and immediate risk.
It has not been submitted to the necessary clinical studies to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect the "close contact" and therefore a potential risk of infection by monitoring data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is identified, the application not only recommends self-confination, but also alerts local health officials. Analysis of cell information macrodata, facial recognition technology, monitoring of mobile phones and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those with whom they were in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government allowed security agencies to track data from mobile phones of people suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen the quarantine and to protect those who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared summary data on the location of phones with the German federal government agency Robert Koch Institute in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia implemented facial recognition technology to detect quarantine failures.
Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said mobile telephony operators have informed him that "in any case, 40% of the people are still moving".
The German Government held a 48-hour weekend hackton with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, Estonia's president, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global request for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People may feel anxious about the quarantine, travel restrictions and side effects of treatment or fear of infection in themselves.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "The growing social isolation, loneliness, anxiety for health, stress and economic problems are a perfect storm for mental health and the well-being of people."
The disease may continue to evolve slightly with little or no symptoms, so other diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as the common cold, may appear.
Mild cases are usually recovered within two weeks, while serious or critical cases may take from three to six weeks to do so.
Pregnancy women may be at risk of developing a serious infection by the COVID-19 virus, according to data from other similar viruses, such as the SRAG virus and SROM, but data from COVID-19 are insufficient. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In more severe cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to the respiratory difficulties syndrome of water (SDRA) causing respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organism insufficiency.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, convulsions and heart, kidney and liver damage.
The change in coagulation, specifically the increase in protombin time, has been reported in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19; while the change in renal function is observed in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with CODIV-19 have high liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the mean time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to the ICU, the average time between hospitalization and death was seven days.
In an initial case study, the mean time from the onset of the first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a complete interval of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the mortality rate among men was 2.8 per cent and among women was 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem samples of the lungs show diffuse alveolar damage with exuded cell fibromyxides in both lungs.
Viral cytopathetic changes in the neumocytosis were observed.
The image of the lungs was similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart damage resulted from high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized people had a preexisting condition, and the availability of medical resources and the socio-economic aspects of a region could also affect mortality.
The estimates of mortality due to affection varied due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The insufficient account of mild cases may result in overestimation of the mortality rate.
However, the fact that death is the result of past cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers had 1.4 times more chances of severe COVID-19 symptoms and approximately 2.4 times more possibilities of needing intensive care or dying compared to non-smoking. Long-term sequelae of this disease were concerned.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20-30% decrease in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and images of the lungs suggest organ damage.
This can also cause the syndrome after intensive care after recovery.
In March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections generated effective long-term immunity in people recovering from the disease.
It seems that immunity is possible, based on the behavior of other coronary viruses, but recovered cases of COVID-19 have been reported that have subsequently given positive effects on coronary viruses.
These cases are believed to be a worsening of a persistent infection rather than a reinfection.
This virus is considered to be natural and of animal origin, by means of an interspecific infection.
The real origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely due to transmission between humans.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, noted as the first date of onset of symptoms as at 1 December 2019.
WHO official publications reported that the first manifestation of symptoms was on 8 December 2019.
A number of measures are generally taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary in region and in time, in addition to being affected by the volume of the tests, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time spent from the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned emergency CIE-10 disease codes U07.1 to deaths with confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection laboratory and U07.2 to deaths with a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection laboratory. The lethality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed at a specified time interval.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the overall fatality rate is 6.9% (153 8222/2 240 191) as of April 17, 2020.
The number varies from region to region. Other measures include the rate of fatality in diagnosed patients (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a disease, and the rate of fatality in infected persons, which reflects the percentage of infected people (with or without a diagnosis) who die from a disease.
These statistics do not depend on time and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people produce antibodies, their presence may provide information on how many people were infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small villa of 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) had already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival festivals and affected the younger, so there was relatively low mortality, and it is possible that not all deaths by COVID-19 have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been exceeded.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3 per cent of the population has antibodies, as determined by blood donors.
It has been confirmed that 69 (0.004 per cent of the population) died by COVID-19.
The impact of pandemic and mortality rates are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher among men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is for those in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is only 90 years old.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 in men and 1.7 in women.
The exact reasons for this gender difference are not known, but it could be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
Immunological gender-based differences, the lower number of women who smoke and the fact that men have eaten diseases, such as hypertension, at an earlier age, could have contributed to the highest rate of mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected were male and 72% of the deaths of COVID-19 were male.
In April 2020, the U.S. Government did not trace information on sex in the HIV infection of COVID-19.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SRAG, affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, in particular nursing staff, are women, and have more opportunities for exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyeus explained that CO refers to crown, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 to the date the outbreak was discovered: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or group of persons, in accordance with international recommendations, is named to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 responsible virus" in public communications.
It is common to use coronavirus to refer both to the disease and to the virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common to refer to the virus and the disease as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and water respiratory disease for 2019-nCOV as temporary names for the virus and disease, according to the 2015 indication not to use locations in the name of viruses and diseases.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to the capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasal hyosopes and parts of the respiratory system.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed the valve of a smoker and the supplier could not deliver it at the required time, a local emerging company made reverse engineering and printed the 100 necessary valves during the night.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and misinformation on origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease that were rapidly spread over the Internet emerged.
It seemed that humans could transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study did not find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks or chickens.
There are no medicines or vaccines approved to treat the disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and sector researchers are conducting international research on vaccines and medicinal products for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARIDAD Test" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the four most promising antiviral compounds in terms of effectiveness.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing possible vaccines.
The previous work on SARS-COV is being used because SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 use the ECA2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers seek to develop a full virus vaccine.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to generate a rapid immune response from the human body to a new infection by the COVID-19 virus.
A second strategy, subunital vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on protein S that helps the virus to get into the ECA2 receptor.
A third strategy is nuclear acid vaccines (DNA or DNA vaccines, a new technique for the creation of vaccines).
The experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and effectiveness. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers in Seattle began.
The vaccine contains an innocuous copy of the genetic code of the virus that causes the disease. It has been suggested that antibody-based improvement is a potential challenge for the development of vaccines against SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials were conducted.
Seven trials evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Re-adjusted antiviral drugs constitute most of the Chinese research, including nine Phase III tests on remedisive in several countries and should be submitted by the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on the vaccine and possible anti-COVID-19 drugs was under way. Several antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are evaluated, including the following: remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
In March 2020, there is an attempt to prove the effectiveness of remedisive.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with the compassionate use of remedesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the USA, China and Italy. The chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020. The results were preliminary.
However, there are requests for peer review for the investigation.
The health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, although Wuhan's Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, it points out that the double dose is very dangerous and could be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an urgent authorisation for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating patients with COVID-19. The 7th edition of Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-COV-2 in vitro.
More in vivo studies of nitazoxanide have been recommended after determining that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial inhibition of the S protein that performs type 2 transmembranial serum (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through the interaction with the ECA2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have important limitations that prevent the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The release of cytokines can be a complication of the last stages of the serious COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that avoid the release of cytokines. The National Health Commission of China included tocilizumab in treatment patterns after completion of a small study.
It is in a national non-randomized phase II test in Italy after observing positive results in people with serious disease.
It is expected that, in combination with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine release, you will counter these effects, which are believed to be the cause of death of some infected people.
The FDA approved the antagonist of the interleukin-6 receptor based on past cases for the treatment of cytokine-resistant steroid-induced steroids, the treatment of T-CAR T lymphocytes in 2017.
To date, there is no unannounced controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system from those who have been collected from the COVID-19 is under investigation to persons who need them as a passive immunization method without vaccines.
This strategy was tested with the SRAG with unconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action through which passive treatment with antibodies can defend against SARS-COV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as cell cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive treatment with antibodies, for example, are being developed using manufactured monoclonal antibodies.
The production of convalescent sweat, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to achieve a faster distribution.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later died from COVID-19 after generating awareness of the spread of the virus.
