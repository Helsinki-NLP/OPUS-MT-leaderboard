Named after the number of trainees to Donbass from Ukraine
The official representative of the People's militia of the self-proclaimed Lugan People's Republic (LNR) said that in winter 2018-2019, Ukraine would send at least 3,000 new recruits to Donbass.
According to him, this is how Kiev plans “to do something to complete the units”.
"Ukraine citizens' refusal to serve in the ranks of Ukraine's VPs, mass dismissals have led to a low capacity of units," said Maročko, quoted by the RIA News.
He also did not rule out that real figures for the Ukrainian army could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched a so-called anti-terrorism operation (ATO), which was later replaced by a joint force operation (MOP).
This measure was expected to enhance the role of Ukrainian forces in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbasse was exacerbated by the murder of the head of the DNR Aleksandra Zachchenko.
The DNA authorities qualified as a terrorist.
Several persons involved in the explosion were detained during the criminal investigation.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the diversion was organized by Ukrainian special services.

The head of the British media compared the EU with the Soviet Union and the prison
The British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt compared the Euro Union with the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of arresting the member countries of the Community.
The diplomat made such a statement to the presence of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, which was opened on Sunday, 30 September.
As the Daily Mail notes, Hunt thus commented on difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to belief in a European dream and its ideals?
The EU was set up to protect freedom and the Soviet Union had not allowed anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from the community into a prison, the desire to leave it will not decrease, it will only grow, and we will not be the only one who wants to escape the prison," the Minister said.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for deciding to leave the European Union would only exacerbate the crisis, notes Gazeta.ru.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Teresa May stated that Brexit's negotiations had gone to a standstill.
She thus commented on the results of the informal European Union summit in Salzburg.
The Brexit decision was adopted in 2016 following the referendum.
The United Kingdom's exit is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by a number of factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
In addition, the issue of the Irish border remains open.

Ilon Mask has to leave the post of Chief of the Tesla Board of Directors
The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the founder of Tesla Ilon Mask have settled their dispute on fraud.
That's what CNBC News reports.
According to the telecanal, the Masquerade Agreements will have to leave the post of Chief of the Board of Directors of Tesla.
The Commission thus allowed Moscow to retain the position of Head of Tesla.
As noted, the founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
A similar amount will be taken with Tesla.
In this way, the money will be distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company should appoint two independent directors.
Ilon Mask is an American entrepreneur who lists 50 richer people on the Forbes version of the magazine.
He is the Head of SpaceX Space Corporation, the Neurotechnological Company of Neurolink and the Developer of Tesla electorate, and the co-founder of Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had previously brought to court the Director General of Tesla Ilon Maska for his statement on the possible redemption of the company on Twitter.
Last month, Moscow announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy all shares at a fixed price of $420.
The value of the stock in $420 was reported as “due to the importance of this figure in the marijuana culture”, Bloomberg previously reported with reference to the Co-Director of the Commission's Security Division, Stephen Beijing.
However, Ilon Mask subsequently refused to buy shares.
Commenting on the claim made against him by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman stated that he considered the charges of fraud unfounded and added that he was very disappointed and concerned about these claims.
"Frequentness is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I did not break it in any way," the businessman said in an interview with CNBC.
In August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective complaint against Moscow, complaining about the financial losses suffered.
The complainants claimed that the businessmen’s posts had been damaged.
In particular, one of the shareholders stated that the Twitter businessmen were mistaken, as a result of which Tesla stock sellers were forced to purchase papers at artificially high prices to cover their positions.
Other claimants also noted that the unwarranted statements of Ilon Maska led to sharp fluctuations in the course.
In September, Ilona Maska accused even the head of the Citron Research research company.
In the meantime, had Moscow not been able to settle its dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, it would have been in danger of being removed from company management and even prison.
In particular, CNBC's former chairman of the Harvey Pitts Commission reported on this.
The mask is a "bad guy who can't run a car company."

In the RPC, the possible renaming of the PPC compared with the actions of fascists
The head of the Department of External Church Liaisons (VOCS) of the Moscow Patriarchate, the Volocolamian Ilarion, compared the possible renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the Fascists in Germany.
Mitropolit Volocolamsky Ilarion - about the causes of the conflict with the Constantinople Patriarchate, possible church division and its political sub-text
According to him, now that “the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is at an acute stage,” the name of the church is as much as in Fascist Germany “to attract Jews to the yellow six-footed star”.
"This means marking the church as an enemy organization, and for that purpose this bill was created," said a representative of the RPC in the Russian Telecanal 24.
Mitropolit also stressed that the UPC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian church, since “the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country”.
UPC called for constant-police excursions to leave its territory
Gran-pri in Sochi: English, Russian ballid and return to Quetta
For the next ten years in Russia, a gonorrhea can occur.
The Deputy Prime Minister of the RF Dmitri Kozak said this by holding a meeting with Russian automakers before the launch of Gran-pri Russia in Sochi.
The Vice-President of the Government also shared his views on the return of Daniel Quetta to Toro Rosso and assessed the visit of the Russian Formula-1 phase.
As a result of our meeting with automakers, it must become a clear future for the creation of a Russian Formula-1 ball, which has no analogues in the world, says Dmitri Kozak.
We must encourage our car manufacturers in this direction.
It was a plan by 2024, but I don't think it's possible at that time.
I think more realistic times are for the next ten years."
From 2012 to 2014, the "Formule-1" under the Russian licence was the "Marusa" team.
According to the vice-premier, there are already investors who are ready to invest in the creation of a national team at the World Roads Championship in Formula-1.
I know that in Russia there are car sports fans, state-of-the-art businessmen who are willing to invest, ready to invest in the creation of the Russian Formula-1 team, he noted.
"We are willing to support them morally.
We'll hope we have a team like that.
I suspect that the ideas about the establishment of a team have emerged, including because such an infrastructure has emerged in Sochi."
Tomorrow's "Socie Autodrome" is waiting for an Englishman.
According to Dmitria Kozak, the organizers have managed to implement all 50,000 tickets.
See, even the Tribunal's qualifications were practically filled, the Deputy Prime Minister noted.
I can say that this year's yield rose by 72 per cent compared to last year.
That's a good, positive result.
We are also preparing a plan of action to improve the efficiency of the use of the face-to-face infrastructure throughout the year.
This will be an additional tourist product that will add even greater attraction to Sochi.
Dmitri Kozak did not go through and the main theme of the day for Russian car lovers is the return of Daniel Quetta to Toro Rosso.
We all congratulate Daniel and wish him success in the next season, the vice-premier said to the press.
He is the All-embracing, the All-mighty.
The next year, for the first time in history, the Formula-1 pilot will be able to participate immediately in two major Russian pilots.
Although Serge Sirotkin's further fate in the "Corolean Races" is still unknown.
His contract with Williams ends at the end of the season, and the results are not yet impressive: he took the 18th place in the qualifications of Gran-pri Russia.
We hope that next season our main pilots will be more than this year, said Dmitri Kozak.

On 30 September 1928, that is, 90 years ago, British bacteria Alexander Fleming announced that there was no opening.
The opening of the penicillin marked the beginning of the era of modern antibiotics, brought the Fleming world fame and made it the Nobel laureate.
In fact, the release of penicillin from dance mushrooms was not the first opening of Fleming.
A few years earlier, he had sown a drop of his own nose on Peter’s cup (a glass jar that had experience with bacteria) and found that after a few days the bacteria were destroyed.
In almost the same way, penicillin was found.
The name Fleming has been added to the list of the 100 most outstanding persons in human history.
His openness has, in the opinion of many scholars, changed the course of history.
With the help of penicillin, medicine began to deal with most of the older diseases, previously considered untreated, tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...
When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, the Paris newspaper wrote: "For the collapse of fascism and liberation of France he did more than ten divisions".
According to experts, the release of Fleming’s first world antibiotic has saved more than 200 million Earth’s inhabitants.

Trump told me about "love" in Kim Chen Ihn.
From the harshness of the U.S. leaders and the Canadians, it's almost as if they fell in love with each other, Donald Trump was joking.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, noted the success of the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries have now corrected relations so much that they are hardly in love with each other, the President of the United States said.
The owner of the White House recalled that the North Korean problem had been adopted by the previous administration as the main challenge in foreign policy.
Trump noted that Barack Obama's team had so much to do with the CDR that she could not even call the country's leadership - there simply had not been a recording of the pipe.
At that time, the United States and the Canadians were on the threshold of war, and today the North Korean leader writes in the White House "precious letters", Trump noted.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work, he was also "worse" to Kim Chen Inn, which, by the way, was mutual.
But now their relationship has been corrected so much that the leaders have “in love with one another”.
However, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that American media interpreted them as incompetence.
Trump drew attention to the recent cessation of the nuclear and missile tests and the closure of military sites.
All of this is the merit of his administration's work, assured by the President of the United States.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump referred to Kim Chen Ine as a member of the UN Genoa Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and steps taken to descale tensions.
However, Trump noted that sanctions against the PRC would remain until the full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

The meeting was a positive outcome of the ceasefire in the nuclear and missile tests of the DPRK, as well as the return to the United States of America of the remains of American soldiers.
However, other practical steps towards the denuclearization of North Korea are still being taken.
The media reported that several disarmament scenarios had already been sent to the CDR since the United States Singapore Summit, but Phanyan rejected them, calling them "gangster".

Nicao called for "Moscian language by Ukrainian product"
The Ukrainian children ' s novelty and the struggle for the purity of the native language, Larissa, called for the withdrawal from Ukraine of the Russian-speaking Moscow product and the Moscow language.
To do this, she proposes a Ukrainian product, “cultural wave, cultural pressure”.
With its views on the “integration of the Russian language in Ukraine” Nicosia shared with the Ukrainian edition “Observer”.
According to her, the relevant Ukrainian product is now being prepared - even now there is and continues to be further developed.
In time, the Ukrainians will "get better" from this "musk language", she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, she said that the Russian word had been widely used on television and radio before, but it had not remained in public space.
However, in the view of Nice, Ukraine does not apply aggressive methods in this process: in its view, the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language are merely “enlargement of borders for the Ukrainian language at the legislative level”.
In the past, Nice shared her experience in maintaining the Ukrainian language regime at a child camp in Karpatah, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the court with the Watsons bookstore network, one of which was associated with her in Russian.
When she did not get her own way, Nixa turned into a girl who was giving up.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians is called "language schizophrenia", urging Ukrainians to reject Russian letters even in the writing of the names.
Recently, Nice stated that the name "Russia" was stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
The writer's anger was not able to escape even the Ukrainian Security Service: when he was there and heard the conversation with the Russians, she made a scandal and left, knocking on the door.

How did he feel today?"
"If you've lasted 90 minutes, I mean, it's all right!
In fact, he felt good.
Maybe at the end of a bit of power, nothing happened.
And yes, the doctor and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolievich Gashnev brought me to this game, for which they are so grateful!
"What about the atmosphere in the team?"
"It's no secret to anyone, that after victory and recovery, and the mood in the collective is good.
Now we had a white coat, though it was black at first.
We must continue in the same spirit and rejoice with the sick."
"Have you tried the game since he didn't go out in the field?"
"It's like, it's been a little awkward, because, really, the unpleasant situation has gone away.
But I'll do it again, thanks to the physiotherapist and the doctors who put it on their feet.
Most importantly, we won and encouraged the patients.
And the rest is secondary."

Kosacev: At the 73rd session of the United Nations Assembly, the topic of Russia was virtually absent from the key
The head of the Board of the Federation of International Affairs Committee, Constantine Kosacev, sees the 73rd session of the UN Geneva Assembly as a success for Russia and does not rule out that it will be able to return to the perception of the RF as an integral participant in addressing global world problems.
"The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric we have been accustomed to in recent years to Russia was now more inflamed," said the senator in an interview published on Sunday in the Russian newspaper.
He explained that in the past years, the RF was “described as one of the three main threats to humanity, along with the Ebola disease, together with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this series, in any case, in the statement of a group of Western countries, which was sufficiently unanimous in this regard”.
At the 73rd session, he stressed Kosacev, “the topic of Russia was virtually absent in the negative key”.
"If I look closely at the statement of the President of the United States, the President of France, the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, I do not now take Ukraine, Georgia, or British, in any case, people were not exactly," said the politician, noting that Russia “was not the biggest wall that had been trained by a tennis ball."
The head of the Souveda Profile Committee does not rule out that this is evidence of a trend that, in his view, “will be allocated to the current session [United Nations Genoa Assembly], although this trend may be fully manifested within two or three years”.
"I do not rule out that the current session may in some way be a turning point," said Kosacev, explaining that "too many examples of how Russia's involvement in international affairs succeeds."
As an example, he led situations in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"So far, unfortunately, not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukraine crisis will also be excavated in time," the MP added.
This is related to what he believes is “adequate, healthy perception of Russia as simply an inalienable participant in addressing global contemporary problems”.
"I don't want to be wrong, but I have a feeling that we're going to go somewhere where the movement will no longer be moving back, it'll be moving forward," he added.
Another “interested and important feeling” in this context, Kosacev called “a demand for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop”.
"I attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the Geneva Assembly] of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that if two or five years ago the Russian opinion, a Russian view of the world, which was largely uninterested, the situation was different," said the chairman of the Soufeda Committee.
In his view, this is due to the fact that “the so-called new liberal order, which is emerging with the West, has no answers to questions such as how to address world problems due to the obvious shortage of ideas in global space, how to address problems in the Middle East, terrorism, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, migration”.
"And here the demand for Russian vision is becoming more and more evident," said Kosacev, stressing that he believes in the present session to be “good for the work of the Russian delegation to be successful for Russia”.

In Damascus, they declared their right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hoped that there would be no military force in the Syrian province of Idlib, said the head of the IID of the Syrian Arab Republic, Valid Muallem.
In his words, Syria has the right to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey had the opportunity to quickly resolve the problem of the removal of soldiers banned in Russia from the Demilitarized Zone in Idlib, says "RIA News".
The head of the media also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to military solutions to the problem of the territories east of the Euphrates in the case of the Kurds seeking separatism.
At the same time, in the opinion of Muallema, the negotiations with the Kurdish SDF were good until they were stopped because of the United States.
On 17 September Putin and Turkish President Recep Erdogan agreed to establish a demilitarized zone along the lines of armed opposition and government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib by 15 October.

Irina Geraštenko, the first vice-president of the Supreme Council, apologized to the FF convicted by Ukrainian journalist Roman Suschenko for his failure to release him from prison.
She said this in a video to a police lock-in, recorded before the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of the FSB.
She said that in those days under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris, there was an action that was announced by the participants as a hungry protest, demanding the release of the Kremlin students.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural actors, there are people who know you well, hungry, supporting Olega Senzov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course, you.
There are no international meetings, no negotiations, no interviews, where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, did not demand pressure on Kremlin, pressure on Putin with one requirement -- the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all political prisoners of Kremlin and those who are illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbass and Crimea," Heraštenko said.
She also expressed confidence that the tests would undermine every Ukrainian by making us “bader, stronger in the protection of Ukraine’s national interests, in the protection of every Ukrainian, in the understanding that such good and evil are”.

"I couldn't even hold the bed"
Wachtang Kikabide for Cancer Control
Many artists are now talking about how they managed to cope with oncology.
Unfortunately, sickness does not save anyone, but the history of popular cancer victory gives hope to many sick ones.
A famous Wachtang Kikabidze actor admitted that he lived only because of his wife.
Many years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis that sounded like a sentence.
"I'm like a mole down on the skull.
I fell.
He's lost his orientation.
They're in the hospital.
He couldn't hold the bed there, he couldn't stand, he fell all the time.
The analysis began, it seemed, bad, the artery doesn't shed blood.
They brought us to Moscow, where they said I had a big, dirty box in my head, an emergency operation.
And during the treatment of cyst doctors, they saw the tumor," Kikabides said in the "Unifications" program.
The alarm has turned out to be a bad thing.
Then, 37 years ago, the inhabitants of Tbilisi even came to forgive with a comb on the threshold of his house.
But the actress’s wife did not allow her to protect the living actor, she believed that she could cope with the illness, and she did not leave her beloved wife’s bed for more than a year.
If it weren't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive right now.
Whenever I had a critical situation, she was close to the rock," the actor admitted.
The actor has managed to cope with the disease, and he now happily lives in his home in the center of Tbilisi.
And from time to time, the hearing of his illness and of the sudden end of the matter appears in the Network.
The founders of the Mirotretz website introduced the section "Cleaning" of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hungary Peter Cyjarto.
The reason was “a temptation to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”.
In addition, the Vice-Chairman of the Middle East highlighted “direct threats of invasion into Ukraine” and “support for separatist attitudes in Ukraine”, as well as the “organization of a provocation aimed at the mass violation of Ukrainian citizens’ legislation”.
It should be noted that in front of Sierra Leone, the deputy of Kiev-Pecher's Lavry Pavel and the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) were approved by Onufri.
As a result, they were opposed to receiving Thomas from the Ukrainian State Church.
Earlier, in commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Zakarpatya, the President of Ukraine Petr Poroshenko demanded respect for Ukraine's sovereign rights.
The authorities called the gold parachutist's golden parachutist.
A one-time payment of 23 salaries to Deputy Governor of the Vronez Region was made by Yuri Agibalov on the basis of the Regional Law on State Posts.
However, the actual amount of the gold parachute released from office was several times less than the amount reported in the media.
Such explanations provided the press services of the regional Government.
Under the law, Agibalov's salary is 11,189 rubles.
Thus, it was stressed in the press service that the amount of a lump sum amounted to 223,892 rubles, rather than 1 million rubles written by the media.
The officer has received an old-age insurance pension since July 2018.
His internship in the public office is more than nine years old.
He was appointed to this pension and a one-time payment was made immediately after his resignation, explained to the RIA News agency in the Government area.
In so doing, Agibalov's pension payments were suspended when he was appointed to responsibilities, and his salary did not change compared to the previous period.
The winner of the governor ' s election, the governor of the region, Alexander Gusev, entered the post on 15 September.
Agibalov was released from office due to the expiration of the term of office of the head of the area.
Similarly, the powers of other officials in the region have been completed.
On 29 September, the Telegram-Canal Nezigarh published documents indicating that Agibalov, who left the post of vice-governor, had paid an exit allowance of 23 salaries, and two days later he had received a similar post without adding a “voio”.
Member of the House called on school to tell school about the damage of masturbation
He served as the first Vice-Chairman of the Education and Science Committee.
Based on the experience of his work, he noted in an interview that adolescent masturbation is causing the harmful information they find on the Internet.
It is at the educational level and the family, the deputy added.
Gennadius Oništenko, MP of the FF (in interview with the Moscow Speech radio station):
As part of the overall sexual education of children, this must be done by reason of the loss, because there is a risk of sexual health of the child, both male and female.
The problem is objective, it is that child rearing takes place early enough, and large knives continue to appear between their sexual rearing and the possibility of formal inter-sex contacts.
Oneštenko believes that the problem is a barrier to “handling” and “sextinguishing” the problem of sex and the lack of a culture of adequate child education.
The doctor is sure that many teenagers are exposed to it.
The deputy believes that the lessons to be learned about the harm of onanism are primarily in the schools of the “hyperurbanized” regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim Republic, it just won't catch up with you," said the professor.
Gennadius Oništenko is an active academic of RAMN, a member of the Bureau of RAMN, doctor of medical science, professor.
Dr. Russia and Kyrgyz, member of the Bureau of the Pan-Russian Public Health League.

As a result of the tragedy, several cars fell into the asphalt, and two young people ended up on the scene from the fires they received.
Agg became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" beats a regular record of popularity, and Angel Merkel's ratings fall.
In all, the Germans began to take a serious stand against the immigration policy of Angela Merkel, which led to the goal of millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Most importantly, the latest polls suggest that the anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" party is becoming more and more popular, and the positions of Merkel and Zehofer ruling are weakening.
This week, AdG hit a regular record, rising to the second line in the rating of popular sympathy.
Right conservatives with 17 per cent of the population were able to beat the social Democrats, with about 16 per cent.
The gap in one percentage point can be attributed to statistical error, but it cannot be noted that the fact that a small group of European economists in 2013 had managed to become a major political force cannot be seen.
Leadership in general has so far continued to hold the HCS/HDC, which has approximately 30 per cent.
However, there is a trend towards the loss of points - in April, Angela Merkel's support was four percentage points above.
The German Chancellor's personal rating, which is headed by the German Government for the fourth consecutive term, is also being reduced.
Today, in support of Angela Merkel, 48 per cent of the Germans are below 7 per cent last year.
Let us add that the Social Democrats followed by the Greens (15%), the Left (11%) and the Liberals (10%).
Evolution of Alternatives
The Alternative for Germany Party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the "Alternative Choice 2013" group, which was joined by members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The Group initially opposed the government course, but only economic issues, including the problems of the euro and EU interaction, were dealt with at first.
While the group opposed the "sponsoring" of Germany's weak EU economies, it did not rule out the possibility of return to the German brand and the full withdrawal of the country from the Euro Union.
In the light of the deepening of the immigration crisis, the political platform of ADG has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a fully-fledged party that took on a string of Eurosceptics and began to criticise the Government for the failure of immigration policies.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, AdG was the first to be held in Bundestag, with 94 MPs (from 709).
Two alternate representatives for Germany took place in the European Parliament.
Published video with a journalist called citizens of Ukraine "Bolvan Nation"
The leading political show on Ukrainian TV, the author of the two books of Ostap Drozdov in direct air acknowledged that he considered his fellow citizens as "a Bolvan nation".
They believe in TV and they don't read much.
As Drozdov noted, living and working in such a country is difficult.
"We don't embrace the culture of reading and accepting texts since childhood," said a journalist.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drosdov for his lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee on Television and Radio Independent began to fight against literature that had less critical intentions for criticism by the Kyiv authorities, prohibiting imports of up to 201 publications.
Manchester City played Bryton and went to the APL leaders.

Bronevic Apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
On the subject of apocalypse, money is not only made by video games, cinematography and book publishing.
Now the new niche is being developed by car companies.
So, Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions presented its apocalypse defender, Senator APC.
In a time of fantasy, this company's engineers create a gun car for the police.
Roshel Senator APC is estimated to be 12 passengers, who are located in a full-fledged bronecap.
This bunker, and you're not calling it a construction, because it's in line with the B7 standard, set on the powerful Ford Super Duty pick-up chassis.

Term of death of the Universal
The universe is still around 140 billion years old, ten times the age of the world to be observed, about 13.8 billion years old.
An international study of the scientific community is published in the library of e-prints arXiv.org and is intended to be published in Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Such findings were made by the HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) telescope, Subaru, with approximately ten million galaxies.
As a result of the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which accounts for more than 95 per cent of the world's energy mass observed, scientists have assessed the expansion of the universe, which was somewhat slower than was previously considered.
The press release of the Subaru Observatory noted that the observations provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the Universe, and the inclusion of data from the European Space Telescope Planck specified the limitations imposed on LCDM parameters.
In July, scientists modeled the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new evidence to the effect that the world was to end its existence in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Breakdown.
A regular attempt has been made to unite pension referencing initiators
The opportunity to learn the people ' s opinion on pension reform is delayed for an indefinite period.
In Moscow, a general federal initiative group of referendums against an increase in pension age was held on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 sub-groups that registered various language issues (the entire Central Committee registered five languages).
They decided to apply to the CEC for the registration of a single initiative group and to ask the Russians: "Are you in favour of a pension law as of 1 July 2018, the age at which the citizens of Russia are entitled to an old age pension, not being raised?"
The wording was registered by the Voluntary Sub-Group, whose representatives did not participate in the assembly, but considered it to be the simplest and most legal framework.
Most participants in the meeting were members of the Justice of Russia, Eli Sviridov (six subgroups) and CRC (four subgroups).
Three independent sub-groups from the Netherlands, Virginia and Orenburg joined in.
Sviridov had previously told the "Vedostats", that invitations were sent to all the initiators, and consent was expressed by the representatives of about 40 subgroups.
But for example, Marina Semenova, the leader of the Voluntary Subgroup (the wording supported by another 15 subgroups), said to the "Knowledge", that the invitations were not received and were not planned to come: "We did not understand who was the other and who was the enemy."
Death of the blue singer Otis Rash
At the age of 84, a famous Chicago guitarist and singer Otis Rash died, reports AP with reference to his manager Rick Beits.
He died as a result of complications following stroke in 2003.

"Admiral" has created great problems for us.
"Admiral" has created great problems for us.
The main coach, Ak Barsa, Zinetula Billietdinov, led the match of regular champion KHL against Admiral (4:2).
"The simple game was complicated.
The rival was a worthy warrior, causing us great problems.
It's a pleasure that we've played a lot of games today.
I've already said that some naked people will come, mainly to work on it.
And what we have won is also very important."
"Why did you decide to give Danis Zarip's advance in this series?"
"We have our program on which he works.
That's why it was such a decision," says Billetdin's Press Service Club.
Ilon Mask is leaving the post of Chief of the Tesla Board of Directors
According to the agreement, Mr. Mask would have to resign from the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tesla and pay a fine of $20 million.
However, the businessman will retain the position of the company's Chief Executive Director, the AFP reports with reference to the controller's data.
Tesla will also have to pay a fine of $20 million.
Earlier, the regulator had filed a claim against Ilon Maska, officials thought he had misled Tesla's investors, because the businessman had allowed the purchase of all shares of the company at a high price - $420 per paper.
In the battle of Loko, Ahmat, Turbin's mistakes fell out of the corner of abundance.
The former international judge, Vladimir Levitin, commented on the work of Evgenie Turbina, in the 9th Tour of Russia's Locomotiv Championship, Ahmat, and solved the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you rate Evgenia Turbina in the Locomotiv match, Ahmat?
- I believe that the arbitrator has confirmed his inappropriateness to the Russian prime minister.
I am surprised that the efforts made in the fifth Spartacus tour - Dinamo, either Turbin himself or the DSI leaders have not made serious conclusions about its low qualifications.
The result did not slow down in the ninth round: errors in his actions, private leaps of rough receptions fell as a corner of abundance.
For example, at the 50th minute of Eder's railway, he's going down with his hands in his crime scene, the defender of Ahmata Rodolfo.
Eight meters from the gate, but Turbin doesn't put any pens.
- How do you rate the episode involving Ido, which was at 82 minutes when it turned out that the ball had fallen into his hand?
- I think there was an intentional play by the defense officer in his crime scene.
Turbin was close to the moment, and this episode and his first assistant on the right were very good.
That was a moment to be seen by the reserve judge, Sergei Karasev.
However, all three were asleep, and no penalty was assigned.
Thus, the score is distorted and sports justice has been robbed.
That was the same case when the court of the concept had drawn up and buried the sports spirit of the game.
At 52 minutes, Turbin did not decide to remove the defender of the guests of Oleg Ivanov, who violated the rules against Krychovyak, and when the judge showed him the yellow card, he was admirably applauded.
What do you think of this episode?
Did you need to show the second "big"?
- At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card didn't exactly show up.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of justice that some teams are being sent to jail for violations like in the episode with Ido, and there is no one.
What do you appreciate the words of a football player?
- See what's under double standards.
It was penalties.
They didn't give it to him.
So the referee doesn't give the second penance at the opposite gate.
This is the principle used.
And the second moment of double standards, the judge sees who's playing.
This is what he played on the Saturday of Locomotiv, and Ahmat has serious claims to the work of Turbin because the team was damaged.
Matt Damon played the defendant in rape by Judge Cavano at the SNL launch.
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate in the U.S. Supreme Court of Brett Cavano, who was accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first issue of a new Saturday Night Live broadcast season on the NBC TV.
During a little sketch, the actor played Kawano at the hearings in the rape-accused Senate.
The candidate in the U.S. Supreme Court had previously drawn attention to his emotional and detailed stories during his interview with Senator Amy Klobushar.
Yes, Kawano has repeatedly admitted in his love for beer, but he says he has never been drunk before.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on the charges of rape, Kawano stated that he was a virgin in those years.
These moments were also played by Damon.
I was just doing a lot of drinking and not thinking about sex at all.
I was the most proud, drunk virgin I've ever seen.
Everyone knows that," said the judge in execution of Matt Damon.
Earlier, Kawano was elected U.S. Supreme Judge.
Barbra Strezand found in her cloned dogs a strange behavior.
American singer Barbra Strezand said that the clones of her dead dog were completely different from the original Pitomat.
"They don't look like it.
In fact, [the clones] look like she, but it's impossible to clone the soul," stressed 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Strezand ordered two clones of his 14-year-old dog, a cotton-de-teller named Samantha, who had to stop because of health problems.
In July 2018 it was reported that Chihuahua’s dog, called the youngest dog in the world, was cloned on the 49th time.
Specialists are attempting to clone a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The United States of America has considered Russia's maritime blockade due to oil and gas supplies.
In the United States, Russia's maritime blockade can be launched to gain advantages in the world energy market.
The United States authorities have been so determined to fight for the success of the world's hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to Russia's maritime blockade, which remains one of the world's leading energy suppliers.
The U.S. head of the IMF, Ryan Zinke, recently described the possibility of the marine blockade.
In contrast to world practice, the American Ministry of the Interior does not perform police functions, but civil functions, including natural resources policies.
Zinka's statement was therefore fully within the competence of the authority he chaired, although no political decoration had been lacking.
Addressing industrial events in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that the U.S. military forces controlled sea routes in the Middle East and could block them if necessary.
Zinke said that the need could be linked to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supplies to the world's energy market.
Zincke recalled that Russia still receives a lion's share of its income from supplies to the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East, as well as in Eastern Europe, has been the main motivation for the activation of Moscow in this region, as Zinke is convinced.
The Minister pointed out that the United States was still looking to provide leadership in the world energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To this end, Washington will have to strengthen Russia and Iran, and the maritime blockade of trade routes, which is an acceptable measure, is considered by Zinke.
Colmaki director has received good feedback from the festival
Our Earth, the actor "Gool-Centre" of Eugenie Sangadziev and his movie "Harmony" are satisfied with the special mention of the members of the jury of the sixth debut festival "The Movement", which took place in Mr. Omske.
The festival's festival diploma states that "this is a signal for the immediate response of major industrial theater players."
As you know, a picture of a young Calmese director was presented in a short film program called "The Movement. Home", where eight filmmakers participated.
The main prize in this competition program was the painting "Jana is Ana on the other hand" - the director's debut of Jana Gladki's actresses.
The focus of the National Film Festival of Debate Movement is on a young film, but not on the age of the decision-makers, but on their spirit, desire and ability to risk.
And the Elystin School of Arts, named P. Chunkushova and RATI-GITIS, meets all of these requirements.
He is young, talented, creative, and in his creativity strives for new non-standard forms of expression.

Formula 1 Gran-pri Russian Gong
There's a club I'm following in Russia.
Former Captain Chelsea and English conglomerate John Terry, about why he went to the 9th Tour of Russia's Spartacus Championship, Rostov (0:1).
"In Russia, I have a club I follow.
I've been following him quite recently, and I've been interested in looking at him from the side.
I can't say that I'm a patient, because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have a sympathy for Spartacus and I want to apologize again for the decision made," says Terry's patient website Chelsea.
Remember, Rostov with 18 points rose to the third place in the tournament table, and Spartak was on the fifth line, with 15 points active.
On the next tour, on 7 October, the red and white ones will play with Enisei, and the underwhelming Valerie Carpina will receive Orenburg the day before.
The road script was thrown into a lombardo for no price.
When a man in the city of Somerville (Massachutes) brought a script to the LBC Boutique and Loan lobby, he offered only 50 dollars for an old and unpretentious tool.
But the experienced store manager, Dylan Macdermitt, suspected that it was an old and expensive tool, and sought advice from the expert.
Here it was found that the script was made in 1759 by famous Italian violinist Ferdinand Galiano and was valued at $250,000.
Only scraps are estimated at $16,000 to $18,000.
The investigation found that the script had not been stolen from one of the city's inhabitants for a long time, and the instrument had returned to the rightful owner.
Until we know how the script came to a man who had thrown it into a lambard, but there were no past clashes with the law.
The manager said that now all those who brought the script into the lobby would be asked to play on it to make sure that it really belonged to the client.
In the ninth round of the RPL, we are looking forward to the exciting opposition: Spartacus will take to his stadium in Rustov in Tushin under the leadership of Valeria Carpina, a man who is known not to be a "national team".
The speciality of this meeting adds that the clubs now have an equal number of points - by 15, and they share 3 and 4 places in the tournament table, leaving the far-off "Zenita" and in one of the "Crasnodar" points, which is playing with "Dinama" tomorrow.
In the red-and-white area now, the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the League of Europe, the Masimo Carrère team suddenly flew into Rapido, and recently moved into the home of Ahmatu.
After a farce with the CSCA, who ended up with a fair nobody, Spartacus with a minimum account and not without a job played in Cuba, Black Sea, and as early as it was to talk about whether Russia's most popular club was approaching the end of the crisis.
The "Rosts" of the three battles could not win, because the battles don't even know five.
Let's see if Carpina can extend the harmless series of such principles as a match.
The previous Rustov Carpina meeting with Spartacus ended in favour of the headquarters team.
It's 7:00.

According to the translator, to understand that two countries don't get together without each other, "enough to know the story."
And in the future, Saxe noted, Germany had no intention of ignoring Russia.

Tonight's School Comedy led by the American Box Office
The evening school comedy, which was debuted in American theaters last Friday, earned $28 million for its first weekend in the poll.
This resulted in an unplanned picture with Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish in the main role of the United States Box Office in 28-30 September.
Films in the international market, while only in 20 countries, amounted to $5.5 million, including 2 million of British audiences.
In the struggle for the first line, the creation of Malcolm Li, which is remarkable enough to be felt by another novelist of the Western wiring, the Mult of Smallfoot, a curious story of the knowledge of a promising life with a human kind, in which the chief hero never believed.
The project of Directors Carey Kirkpatrick and Jason Reig collected $23 million for its initial outputs, generally justified the expectations of experts who predicted 20-25 million a week.
With regard to the Summaries of Smallfoot, they currently account for $38.6 million (including in 50 countries): Mexico was the most active here, filling the film with 3.6 million.
The three most powerful of them this time closed the story "Tyna home with hours" from the terror master Elia Roth, finally proving that the director is capable of doing a quality film and for the 12+ audience.

In view of the modest budget of the film, the result is extremely positive.
The seventh became "Unreasonablely Rich Asians" ($4.15 million), which seems to have no idea how to get out of the top-10 American box office: a romantic comedy that has been on screen for the seventh week, as a result of September, is the sixth in the highest-ranking genres in all history, with a figure of 165.7 million.
This is what the picture has worked on in the internal market for the time being, and the total yield of the tape is 218.8 million.
With regard to the last three luckys who fell into the U.S. assembly in 28-30 September, they became the Hishnik, the White Boy Rick, and... the Badmint, who earned $3.7 million, 2.38 million, and 1.1 million last weekend respectively.
Let's add that in the next coming out of the United States, we'll be collecting a long-term Vienna with Tom Hardy, who, without any doubt, has the leadership in the U.S. Box office as a result of the first exits in October.
From the other prime minister in the next week, it's worth distributing the music melodram "The Star Is Born", the Laureate of the Venice Film Festival of Bradley Cooper, and the criminal drama "Your Hate".

"I hope they will do the same because now almost every game is a full stadium, a great atmosphere.
By the game, I guess the Lord helped the Siberian today, because they've made a very big mistake, especially our leaders.
We've lost our leading leaders, which is why it's hard for us to get this match out, even though there were moments.
But I'm still going to blame myself.
Because I think we've missed something in preparation.
It was a second team compared to the previous match."
"It's an impudent cove."
Viewers are upset by Agutin's choice of voice show.
The viewers of the "Golos 60+" show accuse the teacher of Leonid Agutin in a "beautiful camouflage and a sudden retrieval."
When in the blind hearings he received his father Nikola Agutin's voice from the first note, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not return to the executioner.
But the son’s feelings were taken up, and he chose a relative in his team.
At that time, many felt that it was a joke, but they forgave the teacher for not objectivity at the first stage.
But the joke was delayed, and the star's father was absolutely unfairly taken over by more worthy performers.
And now the viewers are no longer ready to forgive Agutin for such injustice.
Yesterday we, the show’s viewers, were upset by the camouflaged and exposed protease of our relatives to the final ladder.
I've even doubted that Agutina will have enough power and will not be able to go to the end of her dad in the first place," said Irina Petrovsky and Xenia Larin in the TV program.
However, for his father, Leonid Agutin "silly" the beautiful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovic sang a touching song about his mother, explaining this because the audiences still want to see his father's show.
But, as it turns out, the viewers want an objective assessment and see the finals of really talented performers, and now Agutin discredited the show.
"I can feel the Voice from the Agutin team, they're doomed."
"Last time, Agutin showed him how he loved his dad, and today he was supposed to be a professional."
"The contest has lost its meaning."
"Remove two talented people from the project and leave their dad in the project that's not playing but a joke, how can you then be called a teacher?"
"He likes the Pope's poet, organizes a concert in Kremlin for his money and sees how many people will come to this concert."
It's a voice show, not a cruel family show.
"On the side of Agutina, it was unprofessional."
"Then you have to offer your own show to speak to the Pope, not to the show that is made for the money of the 1 Channel."
"That was a real chance for someone, and he took some place.
And I don't understand why the silent dad should make me understand more than anyone else with real environmental data.
Why did a workman from Surgut come with a beautiful voice and a tambourine and bring Pope Agutina to the finish line?
And then we all complain about the same faces on the stage and on the screens for decades!
'Cause it won't go through the kitchen.'
"What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
It's a round of mud and cotton.
Yes, and the family budget will not be left!
The theatre of absurdity continues!"
The users also recalled that in one of the traditional Voice season, the son of Gradsky was raised in blind hearings.
Then the meter and the head didn't have to take the son on his own team.
Besides, he said, "Come on, get out of here, all right."
Agutin was unable to act as a professional.

"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to study space sources of radio broadcasting," Petrukovic added.
He also believed that the Moon could be used for laboratory tests, use local resources for construction.
In addition, the cosmonauts should be drawn to the search for a primitive organism on Earth’s satellite, considered by the scientist.

Circumstance client pulled out a box with faeces at the 7-Eleven store.
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg (Florida), called having a tooth on a 7-Eleven network round-the-clock store manager: in May, he was released from the store for an unpleasant behavior.
And he decided to avenge his enemy in the original way.
In the middle of the second night, he went to the store and pulled out a half-carcase and some of the items in the boxes containing the basket.
In the basket there were faeces and urine that Simms "loaned" from a nearby mobile biotourette.
Police arrests of a "criminal" who have arrived at the scene.
He was put in prison and released to the court on bail at $300.
He was charged with unlawful invasion of foreign property and criminal offences and was also prohibited from entering the store and approaching the manager.

They have been represented by an ex-MVD staff member of Ukraine, who is currently working as an agent of one of Ukraine's insurance companies.
According to the ABU press centre, the detainee explained that the vehicle had been on Interpol's search since 2014 and was therefore detained in Russia and transferred to it as a representative of the insurance company.

In the United States, the potential marine blockade of Russia
The United States may establish a maritime blockade of Russia, where necessary, to prevent its supply of energy to the countries of the Middle East.
The U.S. Minister of Internal Affairs, Ryan Zinke, said that.
Speaking at an industrial event in the American city of Pittsburgh, the head of the department said that for the Russian economy, the only source of income is energy sales, and Moscow is active in the Middle East to sell oil and gas, as it does in Europe, writes Washington Examiner.
Zinke also noted that the situation was similar to Iran.
In the view of the Minister, there are two options for the development of events: military and economic.
He would have preferred not to use the first time, so it was necessary to put pressure on and extract Iranian energy.

The Russian pilot Williams Sergey Sirotkin commented on the outcome of the Grand Pri Russian race.
"I'm telling you, I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second turn, I was between the two cars that were immediately sorry for me.
I lost all the positions I played at the start, right now.
It turned out to be a very bad position.
He's stuck in traffic.
They were hoping that after the rest of us would go to the pi-stop, we would fall into "pure air", and the pace would be back, but the reindeer was gone.
Plus, he fought with the partner, and he was in touch with him.
I understand he's a little mistaken.
We were in this situation on the busiest track of the season, I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful, if it was true.
I don't want to talk about it anymore," says Sirotkin's RIA News.
Remember, Sirotkin was the 18th winner in the Grand Prix race, and the British pilot Lewis Hamilton became the winner.
Tarpishov called the absurd removal of Glushakov and Eštenko from the base of Spartacus.
President of the Federation of Tennis Russia (FTR) Shamil Tarpischev commented on the removal of Moscow's "Spartak" footballers Denis Glušakova and Andrea Ešchenko from training with the main composition after the grinning of the team's lead coach Masimo Carrey, reports "Sport Weekend".
The actions of Carrera were absolutely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is the world's stupidity.
I totally disagree with what Carrera is doing.
It just deepens the disorder in the team.
First of all, these are texts, reading and understanding them as you please.
I wouldn't have reacted to this in Carrera's place.
Each soul has its own opinion.
Second, everyone wants to bury.
If Glushakov and Eštenko are making jokes, that doesn't mean they have something against the coach.
I don't think the Italians have enough flexibility to perceive the situation.
And it doesn't serve a normal climate on the team.
Spartacus doesn't have any games today, so this situation wasn't required to break up at all.
Maybe you should have laughed at it all the time.
Spartacus has a lot of misconception in different lines, and there's a lack of play after young people are introduced.
The internal relations of the teams, according to all, do not add optimism to this match," is sure Tarpičev.
The two teams will be held on 30 September and will start at 19.00 a.m. in Moscow time.
Previously rejected Spartacus John Terry led the Chelsea Youth Command.
Sirius students discussed science-based environmental technologies
The students of the Sirius Education Centre in Sochi, who attended the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended the lecture of the National Research Centre "Kurčavian Institute".
The researchers spoke in the Global International Forum for Convergence and Environmental Technologies, organized in Sochi, under the direction of President Vladimir Putin of Russia, are reported on the educational centre's website on 29 September.
The lecture opened a documentary film "Kodia Kurcchav" during which the President of the Kurcchav Institute, co-rapporteur RAN Mikhail Kovalchuk, described global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
A lecture of the scientist published on the Sirius website.
The students learned that modern technologies need a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet available.
To address this problem, according to forum organizers, will help the environmental technologies that young scientists are working on today.
In addition, Kowalchuk raised responsibility for the development of environmental technologies, as well as for the risks that are inevitable in creating such technologies.
"The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it's a huge good.
This is an explosive growth in medical technology, an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's the other side.
In fact, the development of environmental technologies is a technological reproduction of living natural systems.
There is a turning point, targeted intervention in human activity.
There's always a risk.
There's a car that's got people moving under their wheels.
But cars still use them.
The dual nature of technology immediately.
I'm creating a new medical technology, and I can create weapons of mass destruction," he quoted REN TV as saying.
After a review of the film and the discussion of modern scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask questions to the meeting.
The role of speakers was presented by a candidate for physical and mathematical sciences, head of the NBICS Kurčanov complex, the "Kurčanov Institute" and head of the NBICS complex, Vyčeslav Demin.

When he fell, he was severely injured by the internal organs, and the doctors were unable to save him.
Russian flagship "Kazan" scared the U.S.
The largest danger to the U.S. fleet is the Russian submarine Kazan.
That's what US Deputy Admiral Dave Johnson said, he's transferring "Rosbalt" to The National Interest.
"We are threatened by a severe potential opponent.

Macedonia: the referendum did not take place due to the low appearance
The referendum was intended to approve the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country to "North Macedonia".
Greece objected to the use by Macedonians of the name of its historic province.
The renaming has led to the opening of the way to NATO and later to the EU in the former Yugoslav Republic.
But, according to the EFE agency, only 34% of the events in the resurrected plebiscians “did not touch” to the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was only consultative, the authorities in Skopje might decide not to refuse to rename.
Speaking shortly after the elections were closed, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a proponent of the change in the name of the Republic, said that if more "yes" appeared among the votes, Macedonia would change its name, regardless of the quorum.

Kemerovcan has disturbed the herd of barrels in the barn
On 30 September, a report appeared on a well-known Cameroonian social network that the horned animals were being freely fed into one of the local shelters.
A small herd of animals passed between the fence and the grass.
The commentators expressed their differing views: one of the locals noted that there was no harm in the presence of a small hornet on the site, and their appetite could even help to clear the territory of the vertebrates and grasses, but some of the city's inhabitants did not suffer from the behavior of animals:
"These are graves, not pastures.
There's something for the barrans to do.
Of course, you will not say that they're expensive, but that's not the case." (Laughter)
Either way, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the animal-based problem was already known, and the necessary measures would soon be taken.
To give and to give up, how right?
The word pressure doesn't exist.
That's right.
The word "smooth" in the word "strength, influence, influence" is only phonetic, because we hear the sound instead of the word "smooth."
We use this word, thinking it's a "press."
But "pressurization" and "suffering" not only are not close, but even in some sense the opposite.
Make sure you do it yourself.
Getting away (circle-book, old) means "suffering enough, full enough, enough to be enough for anyone or anything to satisfy."
Satisfaction, pleasure, family words.
Previously, it was still important not to depend on anything, to be self-sufficient, to be self-sufficient.
The old Slavic "dwell" by the family word "growl" and "will."
To push, to push, to crush, to the extent of others.
In these words, the real scary "relatives": daos - "Volk" (sheeping sheep), die - "to die" and twice - "to distress."
A similar phonytic form of the words "pressurization" and "suffer", as well as the inevitable ageing of the latter, have led them into contamination.
So we have the same "d" to go," which is also used in the letter through "a", which is, to the best of all, incorrect and impossible in terms of the processes of the emergence and development of these words.
Well, that's right.
But that word is obsolete, in its proper meaning it is no longer in use.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have a negative influence on you above, use the word “to erase”.
You can also use the "press output" design, but remember that it's an office.

Our machine is very slower than Mercedes.
The Ferrari pilot Kimi Reekkonen is about the qualifications of Gran-pri Russia, which led him to take fourth place.
"Who, did you have a chance today to fight for the pool?
How good was the car?"
"It looks like Mercedes was much faster today," says Rickconen F1News.Ru.
But the behavior of our car has been better since the beginning of the weekend."
"In the course of the qualification, you have not entered the speed of Sebastian Fettel, but in the end the resignation has become noticeable.
What's the reason?"
"My attempt was not bad, but then it turned out to be some Mercedes.
He was ready to try, and he was able to miss me, but I guess I've lost it for a while.
However, this has hardly had a major impact on the outcome."
"In Sochi it's very difficult to fight, the start of the race will be a key moment?"
"Please, yes, but you never know how it works.
It's not gonna be easy in any case, because our car notices a slower Mercedes machine.

This man, apparently, is somewhere near. He's never seen a baby parked before, and that's what he's got in his head.

Russian hunter Mikhail Alešin - about the return of co-occupier Daniel Quetta to Formula 1 as a pilot of Toro Rosso.
I think it's just a remarkable news: Formula 1 will show up another Russian pilot, and that's Dana.
I think he really deserves this place, and he hasn't said everything in Formula 1.
Yes, often not everything was as it should be, and I think he hasn't even realized a part of his capacity yet.
It will be interesting to watch his speeches in the coming year," says Alecina SMP Racing.

Mitropolit Ilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename UPC with fascist actions
The head of the Synod Department of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Ilarion, compared the appointment of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists against the Jews.
"It is equally true that in fascist Germany, the Jews have a yellow oscillating star, which means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and for that purpose this bill has been created," said the Russian-24 teleconnaissance metropolis (interfax quote).
In his view, this step would have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict was at a critical stage.
Kiev thus hopes to have full control of the UPC and “put it out of the law”, the minister believes.
"This is the Ukrainian Church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country," he added.
Earlier it was known that the High Council members were working on the implementation of Bills No.4128 (on the change in the membership of religious communities), No.4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No.5309 (on the change in the name of religious organizations).

Vice-Chairman of the Pochaev Lavari called for the protection of Orthodox and Ukrainian festivals
The Vice-President of the Sveto-Uspenska Pochaevska Lavra Mittropolit Vladimir called for the protection of Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his address to the believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UPC) was published on the residents ' website on Saturday.
At different times, our ancestors and relatives of the faith and spirit of Christians had to confess their faith and protect their holiness.
In view of the situation and the information we have, and the threats of the ongoing trials, it is clear that we will have to survive," the Mitrpolite said.
He asked for the support of a prayer, a moral one.
Also, the deputy of the Laver stressed that "your physical presence will probably be needed."
And the priest said, "The children of Lenin are in a state of mind. They are in danger of sedition, so let us protect our celebration."
Those who do not have the absolute destiny of the Pochaev Laver - the Orthodox Ukraine and the world sanctuary should be prepared to protect it, said in the address.
Mitropolitan called not for those who led the believers astray.
The UPC has canonical status as defined by Thomas of 29 October 1990 by Mother Church.
And now someone wants to put in place a new-style patriarch and another Catholic pope of the Roman Warfare.
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us.
And we're happy with the status that our church has," said Lavera.
He recalled that since October 1990, UPC has been able to be independent and fully independent in its management.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchy.
In fact, Thomas already has our church.
How else do we need Thomas?" - noted the Pochaevsky Vladimir, calling on believers and all citizens to ask whether Thomas has any other confessions, are they independent of the Vatican?
Those who believe have a degree of confusion and determination about which of the temples they are in.
However, someone wants to sow hostility and strife again.
Some people are addicted to shining dome on the temples they want to destroy," the priest stressed.
The starting lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
A laver is located at the top of Pochaevsky Mountain, 70 km from Ternopol.
The first historical information about it is about the beginning of the 13th century.

I really enjoyed the first period.
They didn't use a few good moments.
In the second period, the rival had us a little bit, we survived.
But we're a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a comfort.
The guys played great, they ran a training facility.
I think if we keep playing right, we'll win.
They didn't kill, with zero heads the games won't win, but only the content of the game was right.
It will be a success if we continue to play in this direction."
"In your opinion, the Automobileist added in comparison to the meeting in Lower Novorode?"
"Then there was no foreign bell.
In the pre-season, the teams had other tasks, many young people played.
I think there was a completely different game, another hockey.
"Automobilist" is a good good team.
The tournament table makes it clear that the team is playing right.
Good hockey, good atmosphere and arena, and in town.
You can only wish them luck.
The command is moving in the right direction.
A lot of good players, there are leaders.
Good defense, good doorman.
It was hard, we were ready.
They knew the team was going without any damage, they wanted to break it, but it didn't work."

The main Macedonian opposition refused to vote in the referendum
In Macedonia, on Sunday, 30 September, a referendum was held on the question of an intergovernmental treaty with Greece on the renaming of the Republic of Macedonia.
Citizens are invited to answer one question: "Do you support membership in the EU and NATO by adopting an agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?"

As the press secretary of the Naum Stoilkovski Party explained, Mickoski decided to abstain from voting in order to express his disagreement with the treaty that he considered to be “damaged”.
According to the press secretary, the current referendum addresses the issue of the country's renaming, and not more, when the party's strategic goal is to gain membership in NATO and the EU.
A week ago, the President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, refused to participate in the referendum on 30 September.
He explained that he had chosen the name for the country 27 years ago at the independence referendum. The Macedonian leader considered the country to be a negative factor.
"There is a new semi-governmental State with a new name," said Ivanov.
The agreement on the new official designation of the former Yugoslav Republic - the Republic of North Macedonia - was signed by the heads of the Mid-Mid of Macedonia and Greece on 17 June this year during a ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, at which the border is crossed between the two countries.

Macedonians are ready to vote on the EU and NATO accession referendum, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The Agreement on the renaming of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in the Republic of North Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long negotiations with neighbouring Greece, which refused to recognize the right of Macedonia to be known as Macedonia as its neighbour, thus considering the temptation to a single Greek province and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovski, politician: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or North Macedonia has the right to a better future, a hope for social change.
And Greece will secure the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They are the result of difficult compromises that cannot make everyone happy."
The leading social democrats were elected to the name of the country, headed by Prime Minister Zoran Zawa.
Against the conservative opposition and the President of the country, George Ivanov.
According to journalist Tzvetina Chilimanova, Macedonia has no sense of entering the EU - enough to have a partnership with it: " Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government is being forced from outside to change the name of the country.
But that decision will have negative consequences.
I'll lose sovereignty first.
There are obviously countries that do not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans."
Fay Dulgeri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is facing the greatest challenge in its history.
The country turned out to be a mess.
The choice that Macedonians will make will determine the future not only the Balkans but also Europe as a whole."
