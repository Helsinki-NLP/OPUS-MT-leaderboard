When the English speaker observes that the stranger to whom he is speaking does not understand something he says, he repeats exactly the same, but louder, as this person would have the curl. At no time did he realize that his choice of words could be difficult, or that his statement could be easily understood, and that he could say it more simply with other words. As a result, the person not only still does not understand what he is saying, but also becomes offended by being considered a curl.
