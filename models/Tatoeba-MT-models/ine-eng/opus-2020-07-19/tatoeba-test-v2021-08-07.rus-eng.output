A white foot on f3, a black foot on e6, a white foot on g4, a black bear on h4 is a mother! In chess circles it is called a “duric mother”.
White: ladders on a1, foot on b6, king on c8. Black: feet on a7 and b7, king on a8, elephant on b8. Whites put the opponent in the position of agvang, then only two options remain for blacks: take the ladder on a6 or move the elephant on any other field of diagonals b8-h2. In the first case, whites move the foot from b6 to b7 and become the mother. In the second case, the white boat takes the black foot on a7 with the same result.
