I'm sorry.

Leave it to me.
They lied to you.
I have to go ask Tom.

Her sweater is purple.
Now that I've registered, what am I supposed to do?
Clearly, Americans can't even solve their own problems, so how do they even imagine they're able to deal with the problems of the rest of the world?
You speak clearly so that everyone can hear you.
I've got a goose.
From now on, I'm going to study French more seriously.
Do you have any other questions?
It was awfully cold yesterday.
I forgot to give him the message.

The hair fields are no longer fashionable.
I think we'll need more time.
They'll meet at the hotel tomorrow.
Excuse me, how many are these?
Please repeat it again.
I think so.
A lot of museums don't work Monday.
Tom was taken to the hospital to get his stomach washed because he ate something poisoned.
Don't make me do it.
You sat in my place.
God don't give it to me!
Your green one's leaving.
I bet you know French.
For dinner, Tom took Mary to a beach restaurant.
You don't have to pay for the apartment in advance.
Let's play tennis this afternoon.
No matter how old you are, you can always learn.
Do you live in Sashayama?
I'll get everything Tom said if it was a lie.
What's the time tomorrow?
Are there any children?
Don't open those windows.
I always enjoy listening to you sing.
Can you come tomorrow?
The killer could have been stopped.
Don't you think all our politicians are too old?
There's no way we can hide this fact from her.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
Some say French is one of the most beautiful languages in the world.
I like to take pictures.
I'll pay you.
Do you have a car?
Do you love French wines?
You have to keep your promises.
Tom sat on a doll.
The girls danced in the living room.
She is convinced that her son is still alive.
Do you have any books in French?
I finally stopped in front of the old house and I saw the city again.
You won't see anything without a flashlight.
My dad's a little old-fashioned.
I laughed at his joke.
Your answer is correct.
She wrote a letter.
There's a lot of ways to do one thing.
Anyway, where's Tom?
I have to admit, I'm screaming.
We've been using this insecticide for two years.
Come help me.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
My sister lives near Yokohama.
Oh, very bad!
The bus arrived empty.
We need to keep helping Tom.
My mother has a good letter.
What day are you usually free?
Tom decided to postpone the board.
Tom put his shirt on and then put his tie on.
It's very cold today, isn't it?
You won't be able to help us.
She's popular, but not because she's beautiful, but because she's good at everyone.
Ken plays football every day.
Here you go again at any time.
I don't want tea, I want coffee.
The lawyers and the car mechanics are the people I trust the least.
Would you wait outside?
Can you eat raw strawberries?
What prevented you from working?
Who's the manager?
What are you asking?
I was convicted.
The train passed 500 miles an hour.
She gave me this compact disc.
The director considered the possibility of firing Tom, but decided not to.
I have to take it off.
Tom's sitting in the window.
I don't think you really want to do it.
Most of the students were from the West Coast.
Is it possible to have love?
I'll eat it here.
Tom has two kids.
The police shouldn't take bribes.
I was in the mountain.
That's what I said.
You're lying, aren't you?
Travelers in southern Germany will see farms with solar panels wherever they look.
Don't look in the box.
You're running.
I heard the phone call.
That's why I can't believe it.
He was angry that no one said anything.
Tom is the only student in our class who can speak French.
I'm sorry I messed up your plans.
I'll ask you to translate this report into French.
No one's confused.
They all jumped.
Many traders were robbed during the riots.
Why do I have to study French?
She's not tall.
It's true!
We're grateful for your help.
Since we've been wearing clothes, we don't know each other.
Let's get started.
He visited his uncle yesterday.
Tom's lower than average growth.
I found the keys.
I know this is important.
My aunt, who lives in Tokyo, sent me a beautiful blouse.
It's delicious.
You have a lot of friends who worry about you.
I don't have any prayers.
I don't know Naita Tom that well.
Now I'll tell you the truth.
You're drunk.
That's partly true.
He's been living here for the last ten years.
I have socks, but I don't have shoes.
Oh, shit.
She's calling me Kenji.
I have the information you requested.
In a mysterious way, sense of humor is related to national peculiarities.
Swimming is one of the things Tom likes to do.
He'll be back tomorrow.
Forget to feed the dog.
I need to study things.
I'll see you.
I used to want to become an astrophysicist.
Tom brought blood back.
This camera is Tom's.
I'm sick.
I really appreciate your help.
I bought a red tie.
You want me to cut it a little bit?
It's a book.
I have to do everything Tom tells me to do.
You can do it, come on, I'm with you.
Did Mike stop drinking?
Aren't you glad to see me?
I really wouldn't have succeeded without you.
I'm not mad at you, I'm just very disappointed.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
With my younger sister at the same time, did you leave?
The match was delayed for a while.
His brother learns a lot.
Ken's here in Kyoto.
Have you seen Tom?
I wish I was taller.
A lot of people visit the museum?
The thieves robbed the museum.
He's crazy about you.
He's coming inside to speak French.
Tom helped Mary put on her coat.
That cowboy book could be expensive.
I'm sorry.
Is this your book?
I've always wanted to learn French.
Are you gonna call Tom, or do you want me to do it?
Don't be afraid of Tom.
He leaned on his elbows.
What's the minimum salary in England?
Maybe we should tell Tom he's opposed.
What's the minimum salary in New Zealand?
I'm messing with him for the price.
You can speak French, right?
My father smokes rarely.
His intense attempts to please her showed him that he had the wrong address; she was the mother of two children.
I lost him.
She made the doll for me.
What's in the bottle?
I heard everything you just said.
We're related souls.
The boss is very upset.
That doesn't change anything.
I have a meeting with him at lunch.
In the invitation, he said there would be popcorn and non-alcoholic drinks.
Tom looks pale.
I hope that helps.
What did you find?
I think we should get out of here.
I've been working with Tom for a long time.
He's much older than Ken.
Where are the souls?
Mike's running too fast yesterday.
Do you have a European Health Insurance Card?
None of the balls are yellow.
I know a man you need to meet.
I was rude.
Kuala Lumpur is worth a visit.
I couldn't get them to understand me.
You speak French, too?
I just started studying French, so I'm not very good.
These gloves belong to Tom.
Where's the entrance?
Tom's trying to get an answer from Mary.
One boy, not more than five years old, asked Tom how to get to the post office.
Tom's still living with his parents.
Sometimes we meet them.
I think Tom's asleep.
Are these explosives?
If you don't want to be alone, I can make you a company.
Anna's not a sister.
Tom has little hands.
He arrived two days earlier.
Was it a good trip?
He made me a suit.
Men make houses, women make houses.
Where's the bathroom?
They usually come home before us.
I don't know what to say.
I'm your brother.
I can't get Tom on the bridge.
If I were you, I'd apply for this job.
The patient was prescribed by the hospital.
My Internet connection is slow.
We have to keep working.
Hurry up, we're gonna be late.
How long do you have to wait?
I'm smarter than you.
I was fascinated by her opera singing.
You'll find him.
Don't fall in love with me.
Who's with Tom now?
His concert was very good.
There's been another number of tourists.
The door slammed and shut.
I'm hungry!
It's easy to talk to Tom.
The twin brothers look exactly like their twins.
Don't mess with Tom.
I didn't understand the smile.
Bass hunts that you know him.
It's cold.
Are you sure you don't want us to come with you?
Keep your mouth shut.
Would you repeat that if you loved it?
How much money do you have?
Oh, I was sick.
I've got a lot of bad news.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
Given how long I've been studying French, I should be able to talk to him better.
Let me introduce you to Tom.
I have to admit, I'm a little nervous.
Do you want to buy a shirt?
I think you have the right not to let Tom go.
Tom accepted the invitation to visit Mary's feast.
You're not the only one there.
I heard what they said.
This story ends happily.
I'm sick of myself.
It's done by Tom alone.
You won't believe what things people throw away.
I stopped smoking for a year.
It doesn't carry much luggage when you travel.
I got Tom's picture here.
I didn't tell you everything.
They both work.
Tom didn't come here.
You accuse her of lying to him.
There's no point in fooling around, you know she's playing games with you.
George is very excited about his new job.
It was fun.
He gave his camera to his friend.
He must be given an advantage in front of the others.
I moved you.
Take it with you.
Just wait a minute.
I'm swimming once a week.
I waited an hour and a half.
He gave me a public gig.
The cross is burning.
Tom worked very hard.
How much money do you need?
Oh, I was sick.
We're in position.
Cut it out.
How about we have dinner together?
I think you lied to me.
That's amazing.
Where's the bus terminal?
If it wasn't for me, Tom wouldn't be here.
That's the picture I made at Tom's house.
That's not our problem.
I've never spoken French to Tom.
We all assumed that Tom could speak French.
Tom came back inside.
Who's Tom talking to?
I'd like to learn more about the museums.
This shirt needs to be washed.
You won't believe it.
I'm looking for a house.
I don't feel good.
Why are you so early?
He decided to go abroad.
I don't blame you.
I'm a night bird.
I'm glad you think so.
Mary looks like her mother.
You agree with Tom, right?
Do whatever you want, but I'll stop him if I can.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
I have to trust Tom.
I'm thinking about learning how to swim during my vacation.
Where's the beach?
Are the Giants playing tonight?
I feel like he's not gonna let me get away with it so easily.
It'll be 5:30 in a little while.
The school starts at eight and a half.
Tom's taking a bath.
The beach is not far from here.
Ken jumped over the wall.
The upper part of the mountain is covered with snow.
A hug from you will make me happy.
When are you going?
I'm right behind him.
My best friend is a book.
Right next to the beach there's a really good restaurant that I think you'll like.
What made you think that?
I'm coming.
He missed the last train.
I looked at the picture.
You had no choice but to wait for her.
I totally wiped you out of my memory.
I haven't said no yet.
It's not that deep.
I'm not a patient.
Do you mean French?
I've never seen you so nervous.
What's the minimum wage in Lithuania?
There's the hospital I was born in.
Whoever sows this wind will reap storms.
According to the latest census, the country's total population is little more than 7 million people.
Temporary measures will have no effect on drug addiction.
I don't know where I left the keys.
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Sentenced to death.
I want to talk to you about something else.
Tom can't speak French, can he?
I have nothing.
At least once he thinks with his head.
I thought you might be hungry.
This is the beginning of a new era.
I have to put my shoes on.
I've been thinking about it a few times.
You got nothing else?
I think you're amazing.
Why don't you get up?
I'm not the only one that likes Tom.
I finally won his heart.
We had to comply with their request.
Pick the one you like.
We'll know soon enough.
You look tired, so lie down early.
That was really stupid.
We'll be together soon.
I have nothing to offer.
I'm talking to my French staff.
It's a picture of my sister.
Tom has a hard time dealing with people like Mary.
I've tried them all.
He gave her advice.
The room was so relaxed that I could hardly breathe.
Mary and Jane are cousins.
He certainly loves you.
I lost my wife last year.
She doesn't seem to feel well.
Did Spot go too?
I promise I'll give it back.
I have relatives in Boston.
Get out of here!
Tom's wearing a hat.
Don't look at me!
Don't be disappointed.
I have to go talk to Tom.
How about we study together in the library?
I have a job to do.
The proposal for a job is still in force.
Your shirt lacks a button.
I have to go out for a while.
Your green one's leaving.
Push your fingers.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Can I see this one?
Uncle gave me this watch.
The true friendship is forever.
Tom used to work on the open.
Tom pushed the trigger.
Tom and Mary are drunk.
Did you play tennis yesterday?
You're kidding!
Let's go back.
I'm on a bus.
Tom learns French every day.
In this shop, they're dealing with kitchen supplies.
I think you made the right choice.
Tom didn't answer right away.
You're expected to do a good job.
How old is your son?
The girl who works in that bakery is nice.
Please, get me another cup of coffee.
Alice may be coming.
How do you do that?
I've had a good time.
I'll stay until the next day.
I don't like artificial flowers.
It's not my fault.
Does any of your team speak French?
Looks like it's starting to snow.
I've never seen that before.
Come as soon as you can.
I've never been on top of Fuji.
You don't play golf, do you?
Tom's not working anymore.
It probably doesn't matter.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
Tom jumps.
What's the minimum wage in France?
I forgot her name.
This political problem has led to heated debates.
Eat on a live frog every morning and throughout the rest of the day you won't get anything worse.
Tom won't be happy to see you.
Unemployment is growing.
I couldn't wait last night.
Russia lost 20 million people during World War II.
I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
Nancy smiles.
If you're going to France, you're gonna have to warn your French.
I understand what you're saying.
I never trusted Tom.
We're studying French at school.
He said that himself.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Do it now.
I won't be able to tell you what happened.
I think you should give up.
Please, have patience.
Your joke's getting too far.
I had a really good time today.
Christopher Columbus was drinking unfiltered sea water.
I want to be a French teacher.
I'm glad I don't need that.
They're all hungry.
The Japanese have black eyes.
Tom's a professional baseball player.
Tom still wanted to be unbounded.
I have three children.
Let me sleep for ten more minutes.
Uncle gave me a watch.
All horses are animals, but not all animals are horses.
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
Last week I ate pizza every day.
I promise I'll bring it back.
I sent Tom home.
Do you have any hair?
You're obviously wrong.
His daughter has become a beautiful woman.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Fill it up.
Tom's on his desk, he's writing something.
Would you like some coffee?
I'll call you about Tom.
I opened a check account.
He was here at the time.
I put my shoes on right now.
He felt uncomfortable in his father's presence.
Your shoes are tied up.
Tom shouldn't be here.
He took off his coat.
I can swim in the river.
Do you deal with French every day?
Don't raise that much noise, please.
You're pretty good in French, aren't you?
I'm extremely busy.
No one thought his words were important.
That's a strange problem.
I don't understand that.
Where do you live?
I didn't know what to do.
It's time to eat.
I'm so happy you came.
I haven't made a mistake yet.
Tom got six.
I did it for you.
I've seen you somewhere.
They're gonna play basketball after school.
Those clothes are good for you.
I couldn't give up.
That's a surprise.
I heard someone come in.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Did the bus go to the museum?
I need to discuss something personal with you.
He was transported to the hospital with a helicopter.
When Tom woke up, he found out that Mary was missing.
You're wearing your shirt.
Are you coming?
Don't interrupt me!
I played with Tony yesterday.
Jill's married to Jack.
I wish you luck.
He was alone at home.
In the experiment, the essence ends with "o". A multiple number is formed by adding "j".
Tom wants to become a doctor when he grows up.
Don't I get a hug?
I'm older than anyone else in my class.
I'm buying tapes.
We're gonna need Tom's help.
How tall is your brother?
Come and see us.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Jane's in serious trouble.
It was a perfect day.
I haven't had a shower in three days.
The triangles don't have four angles.
Are you sure you want to know?
I accept your offer.
What's the minimum wage in Romania?
Brian left the door open.
Tom, wake up.
How are you gonna get home?
I wash my clothes.
I've heard that French is a difficult language.
I haven't fed myself.
You'll soon stop thinking about her.
Let me take a look.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom works for a big company.
Say hello to your friends.
Let's ask.
Get up and lie down.
Come on, touch him.
That's my job.
Don't touch the ball on the door.
How old did you learn French?
Carol came back to her hotel.
Do you like that color?
Please be brief.
I haven't seen him yet.
The mountain is covered with snow.
Let's get out of here.
Fuck, I forgot my camera!
He got off the train.
Mary goes out with two at the same time.
There's no mention of Tom yet.
Give it to me.
Did you manage to finish everything you wanted?
You'll have to wait and see.
I woke up at five o'clock.
I was afraid I might be late.
Tom says he can connect to the dead.
Can you stay?
What do you want?
Tom puts too much sugar in his tea.
Don't talk to me now.
What do you want to tell me?
I'm looking for something not so expensive.
Tom's got a lot easier to speak English than French.
I think you'll be surprised.
Next time, I'll make more effort.
I'm done with my job.
He's a hero.
I don't have any demands.
Her charm is a mixture of joy and goodness.
I should have listened to you.
I've got brown hair.
I'll meet you at the park.
I've never won before.
It's a little left.
I like that color.
My grandmother was operating in Germany.
I think you should buy this.
I saw you and Tom.
I don't think it's true.
I have three cameras.
Ask them to call Tom.
We're all sorry about Tom.
I hope I have a chance to get your favor back.
Tom had the hammer turned to see if there was any chemical that could be used.
This requires careful consideration.
Tom won't believe it.
I have to learn the truth.
I think you should meet Tom.
We ran after the cat.
I'll go if Tom goes.
I wish I was young.
Be more accurate.
Tom's French is really good.
Isn't the weather great?
I don't mind.
I don't want to belong to the elite at all.
I've seen you on TV.
You have to learn hard.
I'll be right back.
Ask Tom yourself.
Tom explained things in detail.
Don't let Tom get away with it.
He was playing football with an empty can.
I think you'll really like it.
Just close your eyes.
I'm on vacation this week.
My French teacher is my age.
You better put your sweater under your jacket.
Are you sure you don't want to ask Tom for help?
The new production process achieves good results.
Then, of course, his ignorance.
You're absolutely right.
Everyone knows his name.
My French isn't good at all.
I would never hurt them.
Are those criminals?
Can you get six out of ten?
I'm too busy to help him.
You can see her in the morning.
Have fun.
We'll set him up a charity party.
What club are you in?
Azushi may have been sick.
Tom doesn't get on the bus.
Some books are worth reading over and over again.
We're working together now.
Go back to your place.
He finished Cambridge with a distinction.
I have to get her back tonight.
I have to start getting ready.
Did Tom learn French at school?
What shoes do they get?
We certainly did our best.
I'll delay my trip to Scotland while it warms up.
He started justifying himself.
How old are you?
It's okay.
Where did it happen?
Why is he hiding under the table?
Don't make me do it.
How big are your kids?
I'll stay until tomorrow.
Please call the doctor!
I think Tom can share your feelings.
I gave up.
You and half don't know.
That's the picture I made at Tom's house.
She gave him something to eat herself.
I'm starving!
I'll help you get better at this.
My father goes to run every morning.
I saw Tom walk down the beach.
My brother became an engineer.
How much money do you want?
Don't stand up too fast.
She gave up all her dolls.
I didn't say anything.
What are you gonna do?
I really appreciate it.
I knew you'd be busy.
Come on.
It's a big city.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
Kim's dressed very attractive.
Don't ask me for money.
Tom hates school.
You don't have a problem creating a website. Just be careful not to violate anyone's copyright.
Tom protected his wife.
She's got a beautiful letter.
The fingers of the hand are five: finger, indicator, middle finger, unnamed and widower.
The foil is made of polyethylene.
I've done the light job.
Did anyone notice that?
She's a little shy.
Are you sure you don't want me to call Tom?
You're young, but I'm very old.
I haven't started yet.
Up-down how much does a cab come out of there?
You both look very young.
You're absolutely right.
Is that yours, Tom?
I don't have much English books.
We've got time by tomorrow morning.
I like your shirt.
Enthusiastic began his worthy respect for the start.
I saw you on TV.
We went to the museum.
Who cares about me?
At the beginning, the local cowboys laughed at him.
He looks like he's in a hole.
I think you should come see him.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
Be more precise.
I'm on vacation this week.
You've got to get your socks on.
I promise I won't do that anymore.
I just gave you blood.
He doesn't know either French or German.
I'm not a traitor.
Are you sure you don't want to keep her?
I don't doubt his honesty.
Please open the package.
I'm playing.
I have no idea who he is.
Would you tell me your name if you loved it?
This kind of mistake is inevitable.
I don't speak French at all.
Does the game look at you?
This is your home.
The losses were heavy for both sides.
I'll follow your instructions.
He told us a lie.
God gives me happiness.
I want something warm to drink.
Tom tried to convince Mary that it's time for them to leave.
She bites every morning.
Don't forget the party tonight.
Do you prefer to speak in French?
Uh, that's cool.
Don't make me nice eyes.
I don't have any money.
Honey's eating bread.
I have other plans for Tom.
I couldn't do this without you.
Tom wasn't used to living in town.
Keep Tom under the eye.
Jane went out to market.
This cake is nice.
I told Tom why I couldn't go.
The long fields are now demos.
He's doing very well with the kids.
Come in, please.
We were really having fun.
Tom hates this.
It's true she's dead.
Don't get used to it.
Finally, he stopped pouring snow and the weather warmed up.
She was doing not particularly slight hints about what she wanted for Christmas.
The students didn't remember what they read in this book.
He's learning French every day.
I've heard every word.
Where did you get your socks?
Let's go to the movies.
Looks like Tom decided to stay.
Tom won't give up.
Some poisons used properly are useful.
What do we want?
Keep him a secret.
You make me feel so guilty.
I'm mad at you.
Let's do it.
She gave me permission to use her vocabulary.
He's three years older than her.
You don't have much hope.
What's the price of this chair?
Mom, will you give me the toilet paper?
How'd it go?
I think you'll find him.
I was expecting you last night.
Looks like you've changed the whole room.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tom showed Mary several effective ways to learn French.
I'm not good with sports.
The judge sentenced him to death.
That tall man is Mr. Smith.
That was pretty good.
I really didn't expect Tom to make it.
I found out he's a genius at chemistry.
She can't do the way you're walking around, starting to abuse people.
I had a meeting at 2:30, but I fell into a trap and I couldn't get there in time.
They went to the sea museum.
Tom is making a lot of effort to improve his French.
It's been lost for a long time.
They weren't talking.
I didn't call you a fool.
I'm being spoken in French today.
Can you tell me what to do?
Are you sure you don't want me to buy you a ticket?
They're not that bad.
I'm careful.
Don't take it inside.
We're all connected.
One word of support when you fail is worth more than an hour of praise when you succeed.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
It was over.
His shirt was ripped with a sauce.
Tom found Mary's story interesting.
Mary Tom won't get any help.
You won't be protected anywhere.
She was wearing a leather coat.
I promise I won't do it anymore.
I made an Anna doll.
What'd you do, Tom?
I thought you'd be tired.
The story is very interesting to me.
I've read this book.
That was a good year for you.
He was clean.
I can't do this.
I'm a French teacher.
I want to buy Tom a gift.
One thing is certain, no one can stop me!
She can speak French.
He's a friendly man.
I was convicted.
Tom was told very soon that he had cancer.
Tom got home by bus.
For me, a meeting this afternoon is a better option.
What do you have to do?
Tom studied French three hours last night.
Raise your hand.
What's that?
It was too easy.
I travel often.
There's the hospital I was born in.
I've never loved biology.
I owe you so much for your goodness.
Let's split the prize fifty to fifty.
Hold my hand.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tell me about Tom.
I think it's better to lie down.
I haven't seen Tom since his birthday here.
I need to know.
Do you like traveling?
Your plan failed.
Tom made a big party in his house while his parents were on vacation.
I was forced to leave school.
I just finished breakfast.
I have to go help Tom.
It happened once.
How long will you have to wait?
Tom is the man who told me when the meeting would be.
I appreciate your cooperation.
The soldiers started coming home.
I need your help.
Let's get on the bus.
Are you coming or not?
Tom didn't want Mary playing with his kids.
I forgot to tell him.
Nancy looks so tired.
I really appreciate the offer.
Don't talk about people behind their back.
She's grown up.
Come with me to party.
I'd love to watch a movie.
Whoever's well prepared doesn't care.
I had fun watching TV yesterday.
Do you have a hobby, Tom?
These are the trees on which the leaves live.
Who speaks French better, Tom or Mary?
I've got news about Tom.
Are you sure Tom's behind all this?
Please don't let that happen again.
You put me in pain.
I've tried everything I know.
Why do people fear her?
He's been fighting the hepatitis for six months, but it seems he's started to recover soon.
The universe is a mystery.
I'm back in Boston.
Where's your father?
How much is the bill?
A man came to see me yesterday.
I'll be in the lab.
Can you tell me your room number?
I suspect Tom has no idea what Mary did.
Patients often die simply because they get sick before they get sick.
I wouldn't think the tofuto was so delicious.
Are you jealous?
Who's planning this trip?
What time is it now?
Then what does that mean?
I haven't had my world turn yet.
He's asking you to help him.
I've only been to Boston once.
This one's mine, I don't know where yours is.
He could change his mind.
Do you feel guilty?
You think so?
He learned to swim.
Can't you really swim?
New York is a big city.
I'm too low.
I was hoping I could go back to the beach next weekend.
I'm running out of venison.
I can't do it alone.
I hope you're right.
If you tell her about it, then she will tell her best friends, then her best friends will tell her best friends, and finally everyone will understand.
She was cold.
Tom's talking to the French accent.
I've never seen a debt.
Ken can swim, right?
Tom and Mary went to the park.
I thought it'd be best if I didn't say anything about it.
I'm not a student.
Are you watching carefully?
A few minutes later, the phone called.
She wasn't even there.
Jane's from Australia.
Close the door if you like.
Tom finally left.
Tom assumed Mary wouldn't come to the party.
It's the sweetest farm I've ever seen.
I'm not a wimp.
The food is good at this restaurant.
I'm not dealing with this.
Are they confused?
You parked in my place.
I don't know where he is.
The unemployed make it.
I have to take my son at 2:30.
Sugar is sweet.
Where are you going?
It's a big verse.
Recently prices have fallen.
Tom's an interesting man.
Are you trying to get rid of me?
If you're late for the check-in, it won't be accepted.
I'm a little busy right now.
Are you worried?
Calm down.
Tom wants more money.
Is that your family?
That was a terrible day.
I don't live with Tom.
Do you still love Tom?
I won't be able to transfer Tom from the other side of the bridge.
Where are we going?
You can't be mad at me for that.
I grabbed the cat for the door.
Looks like he's gonna win.
I think you need a vacation.
It can't be what it looks like.
I think I found something better.
There used to be a lot of frogs in this lake.
I understand it's beautiful.
Depends on the context.
Has anything changed?
I'm not that brave.
He prefers French to German.
You can read in French, right?
Fred's often late for an hour.
Don't cry.
Who's thirsty?
The girl eats bread.
I love couples.
I don't know what it is.
I can't buy you this dress.
I heard him come down the stairs.
A friend's coming to the guest tomorrow.
I hope this happens.
Mrs. Satou may have sent the flowers.
Take us to the center.
The sea was calm.
She's an atheist.
Tom was impatient and nervous.
I need a new USB cable.
You're driving too fast.
Can I trust you?
It's hard to please Tom.
How long are you gonna be mad at me?
I think Tom's afraid of you.
Why did you run away?
Who's your favorite bird?
You can study here.
Let me help you.
You'll get it!
I'm afraid I've touched you.
There's nothing to worry about.
This is my house.
He's out of his life.
I didn't know you were cooking.
Tom didn't pay any attention to Mary.
Put these shoes on, if you like.
I heard it was nice.
Tom doesn't like that color.
I feel safer here.
I want to be young again.
Tom refused to leave.
He's with pink hair.
I don't know when he's coming.
Mary told John the secret.
I'll learn French next semester.
Tom won't speak today.
I'll see you tonight.
My money's over.
I got him a cup of coffee.
Where's your babysitter?
Nothing ever happens like you thought.
Why don't you want to wear a tie?
Children must obey their parents.
Is there a mistake in this exercise?
Can you come over on Sunday night?
I remember we met before.
I look at him as my best friend.
Nobody picked up the phone.
I've seen you somewhere before.
You're learning the opera.
The new bike is worth 50,000 yen.
I think you're crazy.
Keep it till later.
They're best friends.
You're a problem.
You're so superficial.
I have wonderful news.
Looks like it's snowing, doesn't it?
It's a long story.
We solved the problem.
Does Tom know where Mary was born?
He decided to go there.
I hate her, but I don't know why.
Tom seems objective.
The tunnel has fallen due to the earthquake since the day before.
I need to talk to you about Tom.
Mary was talking Japanese slowly.
What are you doing all this time?
My uncle never writes letters.
Shut the damn door!
We've been fooling him about it.
John came here a week ago.
He rejected the offer, so did I.
Oh, I forgot my keys.
Excuse me, I have a request.
Blossom is a man who brushes his beards and cuts the men's hair.
Do you like Mozart's music?
That's my problem.
Is that yours, Tom?
We're not all that stupid.
Any problem can be solved if you are patient and patient.
Tom started studying French three years ago.
You have a phone.
How old are you?
Tom works there.
I'm not her type.
Are you free tomorrow night?
He lives somewhere around.
Tom liked to sing, but no one wanted to hear him sing.
Tom wasn't lying on the ground.
I think we can do better.
I think you should think about it.
I'm not a bad guy.
I'm the most common office worker.
He was in France.
Don't let that bother you.
Have you ever seen the kangaroo?
Tom can't figure out how to open the box.
I think Tom's serious.
I'll tell them I'm not coming in time.
He often walks to school.
The rats stink.
When are you getting married?
It's pheasant.
He got off the train.
You're hot.
How many episodes of Van Pice have you seen?
Her name is known to everyone.
I think you're perfect.
Is that the big difference?
You can take pictures outside the museum, but not inside.
Let go of me.
You're both sweet and sweet.
My sister lives near Yokohama.
I think you should make the deal.
My intention was not that.
I've got to get out of here for a while.
She loves the color of her tennis.
Hey, man, I'm asking you a lot - push a little insecticide behind the fridge.
She denied me I didn't answer the letter.
I'm tired.
Your English is improving.
It's your turn.
Put another pair of socks in your bag.
Soon after that, it started to rain.
I have to go back to Boston tomorrow.
They don't want permission.
Tom sent Mary a message written in French.
I'm glad you're happy.
When the conversation is over, he says friendly goodbye and wants me to have a good evening.
Let's check it out.
So far, you've done a good job.
I made dinner last night.
Tom can't stand it.
It's hard for me to concentrate today.
First, thank you for your cooperation.
Who told you my name was that?
Aren't you impressed?
Tom's not here today.
I have to buy one of these.
She helped him himself.
I have a job for Tom.
Where did you throw them?
Usually, the physics teacher is late for the hour.

I forgot to turn off the lights.
Can I take a picture of you?
"Can I park here?" "No, you can't."
I've seen you somewhere.
You've been sitting in my place.
I've already tried that way.
You don't speak French, do you?
I'm ready to order.
Students don't have to use this toilet.
You're in a winning series.
I want something to drink.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
She leaves no time for anything but to take care of the baby.
It's nice to meet you, too.
The movie wasn't as interesting as the book.
Let's go!
I don't want to be worried.

Watch out for her.

Isn't that surprising?
He's friends with everyone he meets.
You need to learn more.
I'm sorry, but I don't believe it.

"But really?" "Yes, really."
Don't tell anyone.
I'm surprised this building is still standing.
I have to meet Tom.
Although at times Tom's English seems pretty good, he has no idea where his possibilities are being extended and it's impossible to convince him that he's wrong when he makes a mistake.
Are you John?
America needs you.
You have to decide.
I've seen a lot of tourists on the beach.
I heard you were fighting with Tom.
Will you call me back?
What's your home address?
Outside the dog, the book is man's best friend, inside the dog it's too dark to read.
It's not okay.
My mother made a very nice sex.
You need to start now.
It's an old letter.

Are you interested?

In this city they've been ironing for 350 years.
I'm playing a TV game.
He was in Japan.
Let's take a walk.
Are you still collecting postmarks?
My name is Ichiro Tanaka.
Last year the imports exceeded the export price.
You don't have a temperature.
Did anyone tell you that?
I'm not afraid of death, I just don't want to be there when it happens.
Don't let him do it.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
I put my coat on the table.
This is the place.
A woman in a wheelchair is hiding in a supermarket.
This is your last chance to spend some time with Tom.
Can you speak French well?
What would you do for a man like that?
I don't like snow.
Jane's been waiting, washing her back in the tree.
Thank you, we'll do our best.
Let's get upstairs and talk.
Tom didn't call me.
Tom doesn't like chess.
Those clothes are good for you.

I appreciate you coming to pick me up.
Check if you turned off the TV before you fell asleep.
And my hands were shaking.
From now on, be more careful.
Tom jumped in cold water.
Are you registered?
If there's no life after death, you'd better do something about it.
I hope things are going to work out for you, Tom.
Let me help you.
Don't let yourself be used.
I think you're the ones who need help.
Corridor's a liar, be careful.
Languages such as Russian, Polish, Czech and Bulgarian have common Slavic roots.
Tom has to do this now.
You don't have to say that to your parents.
Let's just say things straight!
She's the woman I gave the gift to.
Let me go alone.
I don't understand what he said.
This situation is ridiculous.
This land is Tom's.
I think you should meet Tom.
Do not add annotations.
He's not here yet.
You're gonna be my soul!

I have to admit, I'm sorry.
Jack speaks English.
I want to see you.
I'm not jealous.
We've been trying to drive.
Can I get your coat?
My dad's gonna make me a delicious party tomorrow morning.
My TV's broken.
Tom just shut down the phone.
Are you ready?
I won't believe it until I hear it from Tom.
Tom can't see you.
Bass hunts that you're busy.
Come see us.
Looks like you had a hard day.
Tom doesn't give up.
But I want you to understand what I'm saying.
I need to talk to you.
I don't believe that at all.
I haven't spoken to Tom yet.
Are you involved?
What did you do with the camera?
I kept on filming.
Today, fewer and fewer teenagers work.
Why am I still listening to this?
Please don't.
Tom's letter isn't very beautiful, but it's legible.
Shoichi's face was dark.
An electric current can generate a magnetic field.

The men brought the boy to the hospital.
They were talking too fast to understand what they were saying.
Tom's hurt!
Are you sure Tom knows what to do?
Can we trust her?
That's the camera Tom made the photos with.
Let's watch TV.
He killed that man.
Do good to those who hate you.
I have to go.
What's the whole story?
Don't push me.
What are your Christmas plans?
Another bottle of wine, please.
It's time to go to work.
You were given a chance.
Would you put the dishes in the sink?
We found out where he lives.
It's not that deep.
He's a great scientist.
She wants a divorce.
The new magazine was very interesting to me.
Maybe we can help Tom.
We went on a trip full of hope.
I'll be here.
I don't care.
I think you're really amazing.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom helped Mary move the cabinet.
Tell Tom to explain.
What's your relationship with him?
I'm Tom Hunter.
That's kind of weird to me.
Can you do it on your own?
The days are getting longer during the spring.
Mary let Tom kiss her.
I've never seen you cry.
Sometimes I hear my dad sing in the bathroom.

You were right.
He was tired, and yet he went to help them.
Tom's not going to school next week.
Do what I tell you.
The kids are already tired.
You want to watch a French movie, don't you?
We played for victory.
What's in the coffee?
The cross burned down.
I have to get back to Tom's money.
As many books as he has, so do I.
They didn't find Tom.
Are you sure you don't want to wait till tomorrow?
I'll always remember your goodness.
This smell and I felt it another time.
They're all dying.
I don't understand.
Give me a punch.
He hates to market.
I think you'll be happy.
I didn't tell him everything.
I don't want her to give up.
Mary is a book worm.
I think you're capable of everything.
He objected to her plan.
I don't think we should.
You won't be alone.
Looks like the dog wants something to eat.
This box is a little harder than you need.
It's a famous mountain.
I could make you happy.
He told me how to get to the museum.
He likes to go fishing.
Is Tom still in school?
Texas is almost twice the size of Japan.
Either you or you!
I hope it's not too late.
His clothes always smell bad.
I think you should listen to me.
I forgot your number.
I've only been there once.
Put your jacket on the hook at the door.
Tom lives on three blocks from the shore.
He's a little famous.
I love pizza.
I'll try it again.
Just answer the question.
Leave it for another man.
Tom admitted he was scared.
If you listen a little more carefully to what the teacher says, you'll probably understand.
I think you should check under the bed.
The movie wasn't as fun as the book.
It didn't work out for me.
I think you're perfect.
Every human being is part of the whole called Universe - part limited in time and space. It perceives itself, its thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest - a kind of optical illusion of his consciousness. This illusion is a self-conceived prison for us, limiting us within our personal desires and attachment to our closest people. Our task must be to get rid of this prison, expanding the circle of our suffering, so that it embraces all living beings and nature in all and beauty.
He'll definitely come.
I know him.
Aren't you going?
He arrived in Tokyo yesterday.
Do I have to fill out this French form?
This local newspaper is published once a week.
I don't know who it is.
It's almost three hours.
I want to know more about you, Tom.
He just became a director.
We're studying French.
I think Tom and Mary like it.
What's this thing?
Never give a dog food to your cat.
I have problems with French grammar.
I got him through the face.
I'll make you happy.
You won't believe it.

Can't you do something?
Lucy's from America.
You really want to work in Boston?
Tom's not lying down.
Are you involved?
It's very big.
Tom just came back from Boston.
Ask me again later.
He's my older brother.
She became famous.
She turned down his invitation.
We pray for peace.
I think you'll be very interested.
I didn't insult you to "stupid."
He and I are friends.
Our best friend is a doctor.
There's something in Tom that pisses me off.
Tom's two parents were teachers.
Don't play baseball here.
Tom, does he live far from here?
Bad weather didn't let me go.
She's a nice girl.
Bob's a nice man.
Looks like he's happy.
They came out of my feet.
Why is that so funny?
Follow my example and get a glass of wine.
Are you John?
I forbid smoking in my room.
I need to figure out when Tom's gonna go.
She read the letter.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
He shot me.
The dogs are allowed.
Everyone thinks about changing the world, but nobody thinks about changing themselves.
She wants to divorce.
You have to learn hard.
Did you accept his invitation?
If you don't want to be alone, I can make you a company.
I heard the shots.
I didn't mean to put you in an awkward position.
Who did you translate for?
If there's a wish, there's a way.
I think Tom made a big mistake.
If you relax and rest, you'll feel much better.
Are you done with the breakfast?
I've got some old computers.
Tom was wondering where Mary had spent her childhood.
Are you coming or not?
Do you speak Georgian?
And Tom and Mary pulled out their weapons.
Do cats dream?
Do you know this girl?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
This is the hotel that Tom usually stays in.
Tom's got some rest.
You better not walk.
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
Let's go ask her.
We usually speak French.
I'd like a blouse that fits this jacket.
I have no idea what Tom said.
He's a kind of star.
I thought Tom might be your girlfriend.
You always complain.
The milk's soaked.
The second lesson is very easy.
I love your name.
We need to protect our children.
I'll stay home.
Take one of these.
What's your relationship with him?
The devil's habit must be forgotten.
My brother told me he's not afraid of the dark.
Tom, I really hate him.
The problem was I had nothing to say to him.
I think Tom was really having fun.
I wouldn't do it.
Why don't you take your coat off?
Let's talk seriously about your future.
I have a few calls to make, too.
Whatever happens, we'll make them talk.
Would you be so kind as to close that window?
The old couple went on a trip around the world.
When I woke up, there was no one at home, and I was abandoned all day.
My math is my favorite object.
What day do you usually rest?
Tom came back to pick up his coat.
I'd better go see what Tom found.
Tom came home covered in mud.
Did you actually try?
The storm stopped the plane from flying.
Tell me you have good news.
Which browser do you use?
I remember what he said.
What's the minimum wage in your country?
I think you should think again.
I missed you so much.
What kind of reader are you gonna get - Kindle, Nook or Kobo?
Is this your book, Mike?
In principle, I run every emergency.
The bell rang at eight o'clock.
Mr. Smith has been charged with a breach of the treaty.
Ken's running faster than you.
They talked to each other.
Are you asleep, baby?
She gave birth to twins.
Five gallons of normal, if you like.
I haven't been here much.
Take care.
That's very big.
I think you'll be surprised.
Do you speak German?
Put your coat on.
I bought a few books from the bookstore.
Be nice.
Last night, it was a terrible accident.
He answered the questions correctly.
Put on your tourist shoes and don't waste your time.
Why did you come so early?
If it's your great tan, you seem to have spent most of your vacation on the beach.
It's probably snowing tomorrow.
I have no idea who Tom is.
Laura could have been sick.
Tom knows what's actually going on.
Tom can resist.
She was perfect.
I have to keep trying.
There was a museum of art in this area before.
I thought your feelings might have changed.
Sooner or later his luck will be over.
He pretends he's going to fall this night.
Anna doesn't have any sisters.
Is it really so hard to speak French?
When was the last time he was traveling with a train?
Tom saw it, too.
I'm not trying to push you.
You're running.
Don't stay in bed unless you can't get the money out of bed.
Tom has to do this now.
I could make you happy.
My dear, if the dinner isn't ready by seven o'clock, I'll go to the restaurant.
He let me wait a long time.
I'll be right there.
They made us work all night.
He likes English very much.
I understand about your party.
They need to change their mood.
Do you want me to repeat the question?
The book is interesting.
She was young.
They're hiding in the wardrobe.
What's the minimum wage in Russia?
He loves her.
Try to figure out when the train's leaving.
You have to deal with French more seriously.
I want to go there again.
It's really stupid of you to say something like that.
They have to pay in advance.
Do you love music?
He was born and raised in Tokyo.
I guess I'm working.
She waited until the water closed before making tea with her.
I think Tom speaks French well.
Tom has to go.
He was very patient.
It's not likely that they'll be here in this late hour.
The teacher said he'd do it in three months, so we could all speak French without stopping.
I caught three fish yesterday.
He goes there every day.
It's been a disaster.
Have you ever heard anyone speak French?
And no one's talking about what I told you.
We want to rent an apartment in town.
I think you should come down here.
We arrived yesterday afternoon by train.
Tom left, but Mary's still here.
Pick your favorite rocket.
I'll take you with sushi.
That's it for today.
My brother claims he's not afraid of the dark.
Save a man, eat a cannibal.
It's all right.
Are you sure you don't want me to help you?
Tom speaks French awfully.
Don't you take credit cards?
Tom's drinking water.
Did he offer you?
You want me to help you?
You don't have to go.
Please give me a pack.
What's Tom afraid of?
You always sing.
I totally forgot about Tom.
I wouldn't be so sure.
My father was about to leave when the phone rang.
He was asking about you.
Ken never went to Kyoto.
His fog stopped him from seeing the distance.
Anna's a cheerleader.
I'm trying to learn English.
Tom went to the mail to send a letter.
Take a close look at the wall map.
Maybe it's not enough.
Don't send me any more notes.
Are you sure you don't want to drive?
I think you'll be very interested.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
I haven't had a shower in three days.
I've lost shape.
Bring me a chair, please.
It wasn't a stupid idea.
Maybe you'll be happier at another job.
I like your shirt.
That's very important.
Thank you for your work.
Drive straight to the road and when you get through the lighthouse, you're there.
Do what you want.
Some people would certainly ask, why don't we just pick up our stuff and get out of Afghanistan?
Wake up your socks if you like.
I don't have ammo.
I'd like to get your picture.
Please take it away.
"What brand is your car?" "Ford is."
I tried to be your friend.
His wifeâ€™s second cousin was a member of the Jewish Governing Body.
Would you help me translate this?
America has enemies.
Did you see Tom?
We'll be back.
Give it back to me!
Say hello to Jimmy from me.
I haven't spoken to Tom in three weeks.
Stop whining.
I know what Tom's doing here.
I know a man who speaks French well.
I think you're wrong.
He didn't stop him from standing up all night.
You probably already know about our company.
I think you've asked enough questions.
Tom doesn't need to know that.
Some people have an inability to travel by sea.
My plane flew in six hours.
I don't know any of the boys.
We're ready to go.
That's a clue.
It's really delicious.
As long as I'm alive, you won't be deprived of anything.
Maria showed us their home.
I heard the steps, but I didn't see anyone.
Is that our problem?
He gave her a letter.
Uncle gave me his car.
I really appreciate that.
Tom put his helmet on.
I've never seen anything like it.
I have an opinion.
I did it myself.
My name is Emily.
There's nothing else to do.
I have to get dressed.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
I haven't understood that yet.
I need to talk to Tom.
Last night the game was exciting.
The wide jackets are the last piece of fashion.
Don't get lost.
With a little good will from both sides, our problems should be able to be solved.
I don't have much money.
She's up the stairs fast.
The house we used to live in has been demolished.
I'll get married next week.
The prices will continue to rise.
We're learning French together.
In high school, my French was my favorite object.
Would you call Tom?
No one knows whether he loves me or not.
Take me down this side of the lighthouse, if you like.
I think Tom's hiding from Mary.
Oh, I was sick.
Show us.
Why don't you laugh?
Did you ever greet PfirsichbÃ¤umchen in German?
It's an accident.
I would never hurt them.
I know about this investigation.
Won't it be nice?
I don't know French, but Greek.
He made it clear he was against the plan.
She can jump high.
Why do I sleep so much?
She answered through tears.
When are you going?
Hannah grew up higher than her mother.
That's quite different.
The elephant is gray.
He's studying French at home.
Don't raise that much noise, please.
Have any of you ever seen Tom?
I'll go alone.
He's stronger than you.
I'm dangerous.
Show me this list.
That's all Tom has to do.
Our son is married, and we want to do our heads.
Don't go to that building.
Why isn't Tom at school?
Are you going to eat that cupcake?
I worked hard last month.
I knew he'd take it.
Don't leave town.
I heard Tom and Mary talking.
We met in London.
Do you have any wine?
This may prove a little burdensome.
Looks like our water's over.
Take what you like.
I have to tell Tom.
That was very personal.
Do they both understand French?
Something's been taken.
The green suit belongs to Alice.
Our garbage is gathering three times a week.
They caught the fox in the trap.
You're early.
You love the kids, don't you?
I felt isolated.
What do you want?
I'm sad.
They're late for the storm.
I guess it won't be a problem.
Talk slower, if you like.
"Where do you live?" "I live in Tokyo."
I'm busy right now.
I feel really bad.
We were soldiers.
Work is not just a necessity, but a pleasure.
We need to be careful.
It's 11 now.
I run every day.
I think that's Tom.
How was the last weekend, Nancy?
Are you studying French?
I'll call you in the morning.
I'm not crazy.
I have to report this.
I've never been so proud of Tom.
You need to use a deodorant.
When you stand up to me, you're the world.
Actually, I'm not sure who Tom is.
There are some things I need to take care of.
I never doubt his honesty.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not gonna take part in this.
You don't look too surprised.
This is a warning that we need to take seriously.
What does the fox say?
We'd like to eat, can you serve us fast?
Let's get our bags.
Tell me a joke.
Tom is practicing to speak French at any opportunity.
I've seen Tom do amazing things.
The apples are red.
You have good hands.
The people are all against the war.
Your hair needs a sneezing.
I'm better.
Tom never met me before.
Can I see your driver's book?
It's never gonna end.
Tom teaches me French twice a week.
Why don't you just tell us what's bothering you?
Maybe they have something.
I could make you happy.
Who's hurting your tooth?
We're learning French.
What makes you think that?
You sat in my place.
We know who you are.
Do you like black cats?
I teach French every day at school.
Do you believe in miracles?
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Tom looks lonely.
Let me tell you something about myself.
I haven't seen Tom since I was 13 years old.
Her hobby is to collect postmarks.
I have nothing.
Have you ever painted this house?
If we were expected to speak more than we were to hear, we would be given two mouths and one ear.
Don't play baseball here.
I got your coat.
We had a great time last night.
I'll take you to Detroit.
You won't believe how popular Tom has become.
Did you do it?
My father often takes me to baseball games.
Are you brothers?
I felt very uncomfortable because I didn't speak French.
Tom's friend threatened to leave him.
Don't you fear anything?
He didn't know anything about him since he left for America.
Now I'm gonna have to deal with this.
I shook my hands in my pockets .
I would never hurt them.
What's your son's name?
I've never seen you so nervous.
He's become a great musician.
I'm counting on you.
Aren't you nervous?
Have you heard from your sister recently?
They're all hungry.
She's down the stairs.
I was alone, I learned.
I didn't tell Tom.
I think you're still in love with Tom.
I think it's better to sit down.
Our sales are falling apart.
I saw Bob this morning.
Get me something to eat.
If you have not paid for neglect, please send the due amount and allow us to remove the problem immediately.
It smells like a toilet here.
I'm here for a break.
Looks like you're alone.
The question is being considered.
Tom was rescued from a random passerby.
The village is in the center of the city.
They're not hungry.
Call me if you need me.
Let's change the subject.
The bar is full of people.
I'm terribly hungry.
It's very kind of you to get out of your way to help me.
Tom decided Mary's story is interesting.
How about we stop the car and get some rest?
Tom lives in the same part of the city where Mary lives.
Now it's a little after eleven without a quarter.
Both statements are correct.
I haven't seen the darkness before.
We need to call the police.
I have information about Tom.
I'm sure this book has never been translated into French.
I'll see you again.
I'll try it again.
No one could sleep that night.
Runda took about five minutes.
He was walking around the country.
The sum of all angles in the triangle is 180 degrees.
I've been working with Tom for a long time.
Mary can speak Japanese.
I need to call Tom.
It's a little cold today.
I'll judge you.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Who released the dogs?
I don't feel sick.
I can't even read French, and what's left to talk about?
I'll do my best.
I'll come with Tom.
Mike swims very well.
Be careful!
I want a boat that will take me away from here.
Let's talk.
The diamonds are the girl's best friends.
Even when he was young, his parents died, so he raised his uncle.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
I have to warn him.
Where's the station?
Don't throw anything away.
What's going on up there?
The dog couldn't bark.
Is it safe?
He sleeps like a baby.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
I'll follow your instructions.
I got a sharp knife.
You colored the walls, didn't you?
My mother teaches me to arrange flowers.
What a wonderful time!
Don't waste your youth, otherwise you'll regret it.
I think you'll be interested.
But isn't he above the law?
One modern factory is fully automated.
Don't let Tom scare you.
The adoption of English is difficult.
I think you should join us.
Can I open a can?
I didn't do it on purpose.
I haven't seen Tom lately.
I think Tom's leg is broken.
Tom told me he wants to live on a lonely beach.
Why did Tom want to study French?
This is the place Tom was born in.
Where were you born?
I asked him to send us the book.
I have no idea how it goes.
You're all stupid.
They exchange gifts.
I don't mind myself.
Mr. Kolkot's Japanese food started to like him.
I put the money in the safe.
We're in a hurry.
Tom heard something.
I hope that's enough.
You need to get close to that fact.
This one's okay.
I was your mother's first boyfriend.
Tom taught me to speak French.
Would you tell me something about yourself?
I think that's very unlikely.
I want to find my account.
I'm sure Tom knows enough French to fix it.
I went to swim in the river.
Mary's Tom's older sister.
I don't know either, I don't know the other boy.
The guests should start coming soon.
I'm crazy about football.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
It was so nice to meet you!
This isn't your house.
I didn't see anything.
Hey, I just got here.
I'm a hero.
Damn you!
Tom pushed Mary from the edge of the rock.
I hope Tom's right.
Aren't you happy?
Get ready for the worst.
Fruit the nest under the sun.
She's always late for school.
Tom made some mistakes on the control.
Time's on my side.
Aren't you happy?
It could take some time.
I thought you might notice.
Let me help you put your coat on.
Watch out, car's coming!
She speaks three languages.
What do you think of this sweater?
Take it with you.
Now I thought you shouldn't smoke in her car.
Nancy smiled happily.
He's only four minutes from here with a train.
What is Tom trying to achieve?
Can anyone trust you?
It's a little dull.
I think we better get going.
Tom said he probably wouldn't take too long.
What's the real reason you don't want to do it?
Can you keep a secret?
Hey, guys, keep your mouth shut!
I would never hurt them.
I've learned French.
Can't you just stay a little longer?
We stayed in Dorchester.
Are you depressed?
While we were on vacation, a neighbor took care of the cat.
Tom's two parents were teachers.
Children should listen to their parents.
It's boring today.
Do you live in this neighborhood?
They made us work all day.
I think you're capable of everything.
He returned home after he had been absent for ten months.
We're moving to Boston next week.
I've never met Tom before.
I called him yesterday.
Let's rest here.
I need to see Tom.
I think you should leave.
I think we were interested in Tom.
I'll catch the next bus.
Tom's twice as old as Mary.
Mary has two boyfriends.
Kate speaks English very quickly.
I'm not so tired.
You have a vein infection.
He started writing a novel.
He's happy with the result.
Hurry up and you'll be able to catch your train.
You won't need that anymore.
Get him back where he came from.
Let's get started.
I fucked you up.
Tom found out Mary was stealing money from the cash box.
Give me a drink, please.
Where was that?
I'm a little early.
We're not sure what happened.
I want something to eat.
So you did it anyway.
Can you do it alone?
She's bleeding out.
You got me so stupid?
If you give someone $20 and you never see it again, it's probably worth it.
That's Jane's bag.
Tom always smiles.
Tom doesn't believe in evolution.
Do you think Mary's attractive?
What's the minimum wage in India?
Don't make a decision on this today.
She didn't have much money.
You sat in my seat.
When did Tom die?
These two shirts are made of the same material.
Are you studying French?
You don't have to give up English.
It was unfair.
You're wasting your time.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
What's Ken eating?
I went to the hospital.
He did it himself.
Next year we'll be studying in college.
What do you eat, fish or meat?
I made a check.
I thought Tom had a rest day.
Why isn't Tom here?
What's Ken doing now?
There's a lot of talk about DNA, but there's not one about RNA.
One of my parents has to go to the meeting.
Thank you for paying attention to this.
Don't mess with your nose.
The wind blew at the gates.
I want something sweet.
I told Tom the truth.
Her great daughter is married.
Tom speaks French much better than any of his students.
Of the twenty students, only one read the book.
I've got work to do on Wednesday.
Where's my grandfather?
The Japanese have a tendency to trust established authorities.
I came home with a train.
I think I can do it in my spare time.
Are we going out?
They call me Bob.
What situation would you do that?
What was the name of the guy you dated before Tom?
Try it again.
I'd like you to translate this letter into French.
I'm really tired and I want to go to bed early.
Tom's French is very good.
I'm not a philologist.
She lives in New York City.
He must be the principal of the school.
I bet I'll get there before you do.
He was painted like a clown.
In her presence, I'm uncomfortable.
She bought him a dog, but he had an allergy to the dogs, and they had to give it to others.
I haven't told you yet, have I?
At the time, there was no television or radio.
She went to a taxi museum.
Look at your job!
He wrote a letter.
I can't agree with Tom.
These socks have holes on their heels.
Tom likes to play.
You're a good doctor.
I wish you didn't say that again.
I saw him stop.
She felt her knees shaking.
Edison invented the electric lamp.
Tom asked Mary if she could speak French.
I'll meet him again sometime.
She wasn't that strong.
What a strong wind!
That's my CD, isn't it?
I told you not to look for me, Tom.
That's why we're here.
He's dating a group of kids he doesn't need.
It'll be fine if you don't get involved in personal affairs.
Do you have to go to the mail?
My veins bleed every time I use a toothbrush.
We arrived fast because the movement was not loaded.
You need to be careful.
What do you miss?
He came back from France soon.
Molly's got a big watch.
Tom's not helping me.
I haven't been in contact with him for a long time.
Those glasses are on your way.
What did you miss?
Tom opened the box and looked inside.
It doesn't feed until the understanding passes.
I would never lie to you.
Kate's watching a dog.
I don't know everything.
I'll never do that again.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
His friend is a former senator.
Is French more difficult than English?
I don't care about this pair of shoes.
Is there something you're afraid of?
I have two cousins.
The lists fall in the fall.
Aren't you going to do something?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
We can't postpone the council.
Since when did Tom learn French?
He was completely exhausted.
Thank you for coming!
Hey, I'm a little sick.
I'm so ashamed.
Looks like there's already over two thousand Ugurian sentences in Tatoeba!
Tom's stubborn.
We can't postpone the collection.
I'm ashamed I did that.
Let's cut it down here.
I know that's hard.
Are you an exchange student?
If you need help, ask.
You've always been a little weird.
You think you're going to Tokyo tomorrow?
I hope it's worth it.
Don't give Tom your number.
Is it true that Tom and Mary were arrested?
If mankind does not care about the environment, the environment will destroy mankind.
No, thank you.
I felt like I was rejected by these people.
I think you're having a good time tonight.
Don't take it back yet.
I'm sorry to interrupt.
The fact that he's too generous is his biggest flaw.
Press Shift.
You understand, right?
Jane always acted like she was very rich.
Tom wasn't the youngest.
I think he's innocent.
Yeah, I know him.
I wonder what Tom meant.
It doesn't matter.
I have nothing against the hot weather.
I think you need someone to talk to.
I want new visits.
I'm thirsty.
The flowers are wet with no water.
Do you know why I'm here?
Tom wanted to understand why Mary didn't like him.
See, I told you Tom couldn't swim.
I forgot.
The bill, please.
Does the price include breakfast?
Know what he told me.
Salta's done.
She forgot to feed her dog.
The problem isn't that.
Go meet him and then release this letter.
This chicken has recently worn no eggs.
I hear Tom stole a car.
We weren't hungry.
The dolphins are very intelligent.
Did I disappoint you?
Wait for me to finish, please.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
He's very happy that his life at school is going well.
Mrs. Young didn't mind me visiting her unexpectedly.
You have good lips.
A lot of people are going to lose their jobs because of the car industry.
He's coming to my aid.
We'll start the landing down in Honolulu.
I heard you were looking for me.
Our food's over.
The moment of fame for Hanshin didn't last long.
Is there a big house?
Won't that lead to trouble?
He's confused that he's called a fool.
Their condition is getting worse.
Do you really want it?
Will he fail on trial?
I can't understand why he didn't tell the truth.
I'm not a student.
What results did they reach?
We're finally here!
I'm taller than you.
I think I'm lucky.
Tom could have lied.
I feel good.
She pushed the button.
I didn't feel well, but I went to work.
Are you really happy?
I know what I want, I just haven't found it yet.
I have to move.
He's a famous composer.
Tom put a beer on the kitchen window to make a toast.
Happy is the man who is married to a good woman.
Tom gave me good advice.
He's always telling the truth.
I can't live like this anymore.
Ah, how sad!
Hello, Jimmy.
Is he all right?
Are you going?
I heard what happened.
Of course, she's right.
Don't make me shoot you.
The equator divides the Earth's sphere into two semi-circles.
It was personal.
Doesn't it interest you?
It's a great pleasure for us to watch baseball games.
I think it's good for you to rest a little bit.
When did you start learning French?
She solved her hair in front of the mirror.
I've already done my job.
It wasn't easy.
Do you think it's gonna work today?
You're very brave.
There's a bag on the desk.
Where did you throw them?
Tom, how is he supposed to deal with the problem?
The thief got away with the money.
I haven't spoken to you before, have I?
Tom was late for dinner.
This is the picture of my new house.
I want to sleep.
This camera's on Tom, isn't it?
I sent her a doll.
I'm smarter than her.
Uncle gave me a watch.
Please excuse me for the delay.
I felt isolated.
I'm pretty busy.
They're very important.
Are you Japanese?
Nancy looks like my sister.
My friend doesn't know.
I know a man who can speak French well.
You've got to measure that sweater.
I'd better stay home.
This isn't very fun.
The phone's something you can't do without.
A few days ago, I contacted them, but I couldn't get an answer.
Why is your mouth open?
My dad's driving very well.
We need to protect our children.
To a new meeting.
I'm completely exhausted.
I'm just looking at things realistic.
I heard you encourage them.
We know you're not stupid.
Tom didn't like his name.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
I'm going to France in the summer.
Please mix the cards carefully.
Get on the bus to Badsharasse and get off Zeestharasse.
Smile is useful for your health!
That's not a mistake.
I guess you're the Tom they all told me about.
Add this site to Favourites.
When the sun of culture is low, even the jets throw a big shadow.
When's the museum open?
I've seen you somewhere.
He sat on his bench.
We just cleaned the toilets.
Tom and I have a meeting at the mall.
I'm not going to face the threats.
You're in a better shape than me.
Do you have a goose?
I hope it's for the good.
He tried it himself.
I'm from the FBI.
Tom works for me.
He's standing up late.
Tom's getting better.
I'm walking like a penguin.
Don't change the channel.
Watch your step.
Can I get you a knife?
You have to deliver the report by the end of this week.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
Are you armed?
I wish you'd told me earlier.
Don't look in the camera.
Wally, but we're gonna go anyway.
Tom and Mary didn't speak French.
I did it once.
He didn't listen to my advice.
There were a lot of people on both sides of the street.
Don't make me regret it.
I thought Tom was gonna cry.
She's her friend.
His clothes always smell.
I want something to eat.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
We're like brothers.
I can't even put the water on the water, but I can't keep a puddle.
What's the name of this river?
Is she free tonight?
I thought Tom was in love with Mary.
During the winter the sixties were covered with ice.
We're almost out of time for dinner.
I don't want to be your enemy.
I'm already a full-time man.
I want to go.
Bring her back!
I'm not telling you to go alone.
I want a orange juice.
I would never lie to you.
I'm not gonna be surprised if Tom left earlier.
Tom speaks French as French.
I think we should make a deal.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I don't have a problem with that.
Where's the ticket?
I'm really busy.
I think you should go home.
Give me your opinion, please.
I think you'll need that.
I hate flying.
What are the other options?
Get me something to drink.
Am I going to die?
I pulled a little bit more while dancing, and I got up to the table.
I believe you.
How many brothers do you have, how many sisters do you have?
I think you'll remember that.
Please turn this into a pound.
I think Tom lied to us.
I'm gonna make Tom smile more often.
I just want to sit on the beach and die for a week.
I'm thirsty.
The bus was shaking the wrong way.
Tom has the right to know.
Your wind.
She took a test.
I'll study at the library tomorrow.
I told Tom the truth.
Can't you do that?
I've met him before.
Tom didn't give up.
Tom didn't get in trouble.
I made a few mistakes on the test.
This book isn't Tom's property.
Where was that?
I've got to get him out of here.
Can I do something to help Tom?
Take your glasses off.
You're wasting your time trying to convince him.
She wants to work in a hospital.
Tom's already a mature man.
Let's not lie.
I'm fine.
It's not art, it's a tooth fairy.
I didn't see you.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
Take one of these.
You're so responsive.
Did you hear about him?
She sent the blouse fast.
Is there anyone with you?
The museum is open to visitors.
Does Tom really want to win?
My grandfather likes to read.
Did you know you were wearing different socks?
He's making a copy.
What color is Tom's car?
You deserve to be happy, honey.
Tom had a unique desire.
Please tell the truth.
Tom went out with Mary on Friday night, and Alice on Saturday night.
Looks like it's gonna work.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
You can't read in French, can you?
That's exactly what I want.
Letter card.
Some of Tom's students speak French very well.
I can't hear anything.
I'd better make sure.
I can't help you.
He got out of the car.
He writes to his mother from time to time
Men get in shape driving a bike.
It's not the end of the story yet.
Don't be hasty.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Let's get some rest under the tree.
You can improve your English if you want.
Get me a dry cloth.
Jim's name is James.
Are there any other hotels you can recommend?
This bike belongs to me.
You're kidding!
More research is needed.
Are you sure Tom's alone?
You'll never be alone.
Is there a similar expression in French?
Are you talking to me?
You're my best friend.
Anna's a little girl.
Just press your fingers.
I went to the park.
I like to play basketball.
The train arrived ten minutes late.
She lives in the deep province.
Excuse me.
I don't have ammo.
You're my best friend.
I've arranged a meeting.
I didn't tell anyone about us.
It was just stupid.
Are you sure?
Have you ever read any French texts?
Ken wasn't running.
I paid the video at five contributions.
I just want to go with you.
She's become twenty-one.
I heard it coming out.
My stomach hurts, Doctor.
You don't understand.
What does that mean?
They come from Sweden.
Watch out when you cross the loaded street!
A man has to work.
That's fascinating.
What is your nationality?
That part is good.
Merry Christmas!
Come down.
Mary's getting stuck.
They're longing for the city's life.
I'm glad you made it.
The dog was walking around the table.
I'll be in my office.
I think we should call Tom.
It's between eight and ten hours.
Tom wasn't fat.
We're all friends here.
Are you sure you don't want one?
Tom came in with a letter from Judy.
I heard Tom kissed Mary.
I think Tom gave himself up too easily.
I heard Tom and Mary discuss it.
Let's eat sushi.
Throw out those socks if you like.
Please be more careful in the future.
Tom was charged with panic attacks.
Can I open a can?
He was a baseball player.
Don't say anything like that.
He came after you left.
Did you eat breakfast?
The room is completely furnished.
I admire your courage.
I'll check upstairs.
Tom travels first class.
Don't stay out too late.
I'll have a rest day tomorrow.
I didn't say that either.
It's better to give than to take.
Can you take this if you love it?
Jane wrote the letter herself.
Can you solve this problem?
I think that's enough.
You told me that again.
It's been six years since I started studying English.
I can't buy you this dress.
I work like a bee.
Brian made Kate wait for him.
I forbid you to smoke.
I noticed Tom usually doesn't lock his door.
Would you help me translate this?
Tom doesn't understand anything in French.
This is the same hospital where Tom works.
Tom's not that smart.
Why do you want to become a nurse?
Carl seemed very happy.
Linda loves chocolate.
This climate feeds a lot of electricity.
Don't touch this propaganda hunt.
Tom thinks the death penalty should be lifted.
First the good God made man, and then made the woman. Then he had compassion on the man, and gave him tobacco.
I forgot to lock the door.
Do you like it?
Guys, don't raise any noise.
Don't look them in the eye.
I'll be back in an hour or so.
Does that look familiar to you?
Take your coat.
What money do you have?
It won't change anything.
The building's almost over.
I thought they were unemployed.
I'd better get to work.
Aoi dances.
Today, machines can do a lot of things for people.
He went for a walk.
Please start now.
I've seen your driver's book.
Where's my room?
Tom suffers from a flat stage.
Keep digging.
Where's the museum?
"Human stupidity is infinite," I say, and because of this self-criticalness, I consider myself an exception.
The storm didn't stop, but it was getting stronger.
Tom made Mary translate the letter into French.
Unemployment is still high.
Tom thought Mary wouldn't come to the party.
I wasn't talking about him.
Is that what Tom would want?
The whole show goes upstairs.
Aren't you ashamed?
I think you should send Tom to Boston.
Ask Tom again.
I want things to be like they were.
Show me.
Tom got his teeth out last week.
The more you run, the more tired you get.
Don't hide how you feel about it.
Is there anything for me?
Can you open my door?
The girl's Irish.
It'll be a challenge.
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
Tom gets sick a lot.
The key doesn't enter the key.
What's the minimum wage in Italy?
Tom turned the lamp on again.
This bike is mine.
I'm not used to eating angry.
Choose what you like.
Go over there and talk to her.
We met at a summer camp.
Don't talk in the classroom.
It's not from me.
When my father found out I was dating Nimrod Nick, he was very angry.
The teacher made us say the word again.
Tom died yesterday.
I thought we'd have breakfast together.
I think Tom forgot his camera.
I think you'll find out it's Tom's fault.
She put her sweater on.
Sometimes my money's over.
Don't worry, Mr. President: with such bad veins, she barely even has the teeth.
I haven't seen you here before.
I think Tom's gonna die.
He lives in a cozy little house.
Go back to bed.
Why don't you try the dress before you buy it?
Tom killed himself, jumping from a rock.
Where were you born?
These clothes are good for you.
They went straight to their target.
The boy entered the window.
I haven't started anything yet.
The bill, please.
I thought you'd be happy.
Are you finished with dinner?
I heard Tom gave you his grandfather's shoe.
Do what you think is right.
Don't you fall in love with Tom?
Persistence is paid off.
They arrived separately.
Talking French is fun.
Tom won't make it.
Get ready for the worst.
I believe the Earth is being monitored by extraterrestrial intelligence.
Let's go to the beach.
I think it was a mistake.
My father's going to the park.
You're not that old.
He gave each of them a prayer.
Don't blame me.
I think you should let go of your beard.
Do you like French?
Looks like they're ignoring us.
What's going on here?
Are you sure you don't want another drink?
A lot of people share my view on this.
The blouse is clean.
A little tea, please.
I have a stupid question.
He finished his big start at the end.
I have to stay here.
He doesn't need to work.
You just missed the train, didn't you?
The child is not a court to be filled, but a fire to be set on fire.
I think you should see this.
Don't you speak French?
Order the words in alphabetical order.
Tom can speak French much smoother than I am.
I'll hide in here.
She was taking care of her sick husband.
He was playing while he was leaving.
I saw the girl between the crowd.
I could make you happy.
I can't speak English, but I can't speak German.

We make cheese and butter from the milk.
How many episodes of One Piece have you seen?
I didn't mean it.
I'm a vacation this week.
If a sick woman swallows a thousand paper jars, her desire will be satisfied.
I'm surprised that this building is still standing.
I don't owe you at all!
The bus driver didn't see a pedestrian.
Why did you leave?
I want my shirt back.
I spent my vacation in Hakonne.
Look at these documents.
I'd like to translate this into French.
He didn't say a word.
They're drinking tea in the lobby.
Tom set the engine on fire.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Looks like he was a very good athlete.
Give me some milk.
Take 300 grams of rice.
Isn't that enough for you?
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Your bike's better than mine.
I didn't give you permission to leave.
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
Be careful.
How do I get to the airport?
Who pulled it off?
Money doesn't buy happiness.
We're guys.
Bad weather stopped us from leaving.
Now he's learning French.
Because I didn't know where to go, I asked the bus driver.
Did you get what I sent you?
I'm very busy.
How did you learn to speak French?
Be there tonight.
You're in a winning series.
I can't be mad at you for that.
The broadcast of television has significantly deprived us of our time to read.
I'm gonna need it all the time to explain everything.
Don't screw me up in the basement.
The new coronavirus is highly infected.
Every time I look for you, you're gone.
You're going down to the next stop.
Wait a minute.
I'm officially here.
Don't look directly at Tom.
Are you sure Tom won't be here till 2:30?
Tom taught me to surf.
He doesn't believe in God.
All I want is a cup of coffee and a baked cup.
I have to fix this.
I've prepared breakfast.
He's following English literature.
The knife is stupid.
She looked at me a lot.
It's forbidden to smoke in school buildings.
I'm really tired and I want to go to bed early.
I love you more than anything.
Why did you come so early?
Some people are able to speak well, and others are good listeners.
I didn't understand the last word.
No matter how rich she is, she's not happy.
Go and see for yourself.
Have you seen my glasses somewhere?
You can meet him.
Close your textbooks.
I heard someone's coming in.
Tom went his father's way.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
Tom turned to me in French.
He can also speak Russian.
Japan has a lot of great drawings.
Do you believe there's a god?
I'm dating the dog tonight.
What's your blood group?
Ten houses burned.
I shouldn't have let you do it on your own.
Sentenced to death.
I've been waiting for only five minutes.
Would you show me your photo album, please?
Tom's house is burning.
The greatest happiness in life is to love and be loved.
How hard is your daughter?
Tom shouldn't have done this.
I'm an atheist.
I never write the words "borch" and "schi" in German!
I went to the market.
Tom's knee was stabbed.
I'll come back to the hotel with you.
Give me some milk, too.
I think she's over 40 years old.
Are you wearing the driver's book?
I don't need your help.
He's in front of the door.
My business is renegotiating.
The keys are on the table.
I went to the park.
He reported the police crash.
I don't see him.
Do your parents speak French?
I'm afraid you can't talk about promotion now.
You've always been a little weird.
Aren't you afraid?
I haven't talked to anyone today but Tom.
I almost can't hear you.
You don't have to go out.
Can you turn off the light?
He drinks a medium-sized amount of coffee.
I'm disappointed he's gone.
You're wearing your socks on the other side.
We just got information from your related brother in Kansas.
I thought I could trust Tom.
I'm studying French.
Does this new model have it on the market?
Do you know Mr. Brown?
Don't expect everyone to like you.
What's the real deal?
Take care of Tom.
We can't live with 150,000 yen a month.
Cut it out.
She got the ticket without giving anything.
A lot of people think retro cars are pretty expensive.
GDP for the third quarter exceeded 1% of the previous quarter.
I'm sorry, I have to study.
I forgot to tell you what to bring.
Can you see anything there at all?
Everyone was at work.
I'm done with the gas.
Let's ask him.
Where's your father?
I'll do it the way you told me to do it.
What floor do you live on?
Tom was on my bus.
I waited a month.
I have to go meet Tom.
He was forced to sign the contract.
Not as much of the disease as the scar.
Aren't you scared, Tom?
God is great!
I just feel terrible.
At the end of the movie, she's very different.
Are you sure you don't want to study in my house?
Go back to bed.
Tom hasn't eaten yet, has he?
My dog also watches TV.
Let's get to work.
Are you sure you don't want to come with me?
I'm not crazy.
He's watching TV sometimes.
I have to respect Tom's wishes.
That's pretty extreme.
There's only 30 minutes left before the train leaves.
Participants are preparing for the final round of the race.
I have plans for Saturday night.
Like I was tired.
I hope to hear from you soon.
Our arrival here was a mistake.
Don't hurt us so much.
It's her hobby to collect postmarks.
I don't understand German.
I think you'll like it there.
I'll be okay.
That's what Tom won't understand.
Don't forget to get your kitchen supplies like knives and cooking dishes.
We're here.
Where are you going?
We're going to the beach.
I promised myself I'd never do it again.
Jane sometimes runs to school.
I think you'll like that.
I could make you happy.
Every student has a locker.
Have you seen Koala?
Tom couldn't believe Mary really loved him.
I can't buy you this dress.
I think you panicked.
He went out to spend.
I hope you're right.
At least 100 people attended the meeting.
I know you're right.
My plans for rest failed.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
He came to Tokyo and married her there.
I don't think it's true.
I lost my sense of time.
He thought this could be a number.
It's very the greatest poet.
What's your problem?
I'm going to visit my grandmother at the hospital.
Hell is a place where it smells bad and no one loves anyone.
Tom broke his knee.
Where's the bathroom?
I have to report on this.
That's enough of you with French, isn't it?
He postponed the celebration.
Marie said Tom was her cousin.
They caught five peppers.
Do it for me.
"How are you doing, Mike?" "My name is Tom."
What exactly happened to you?
Take the car to the garage.
Are you sure Tom knows what to do?
I saw his father fight him.
Keep your room clean and tidy.
I had a hard night.
She didn't like her husband.
I've been studying his face for wear marks.
Music is the common language of mankind.
Give me some sugar.
I'll take you home.
I wonder if Tom would teach me French.
It would be a pleasure for me to sing for you.
Can you ride a horse?
Tom's really interested in drawing.
Tom's not ready.
Are you alive?
It's Copacabana!
Maybe it's true, but I don't believe it.
I waited as long as I could.
You can't hide from me.
I don't want to be different.
Look how I do it.
We're going to a movie.
He often goes to a movie with her.
You can't smoke in this room.
I heard Tom's membership was suspended.
I'll be with you if you go and do it.
What's the name of the hotel in Boston that you stayed in last year?
That's a complicated problem.
It's exactly 10:00 now.
It's like the wind.
Are you a virgin, too?
He's known as a great poet.
We're not gonna be here after 2:30.
I saw Jesse stand there.
I bought books from the bookstore.
I have to buy one of these.
I like sports.
He's often late.
I wish I had a friend like you.
I speak French every day at work.
I don't believe in coincidences.
He's nice.
I'm still a little busy.
I just couldn't make Tom understand.
He's one of my neighbors.
We're almost done.
I closed my door.
I could make you happy.
I've never seen anything like it before.
Open the bottle if you like.
I'm smarter than you.
The latest innovations in medicine are remarkable.
You have to control yourself.
I'm not interested in doing that.
Tom thinks he's gonna fall.
Can you speak French?
They wrote it off as lost.
I waited three days.
Material wealth often goes hand in hand with the rejection of society.
Did you count your shoes?
You have to find a real job.
You two have nothing to do with it.
Many scientists live in this small village.
I'm sure Tom understands French.
I didn't know we shouldn't.
You're a good singer.
The cat's eating.
I'm used to my parents not paying attention to me.
Speaking of travel, have you ever been to Australia?
I thought you'd be tired.
I need to see you.
Nancy looks like my sister.
Tom doesn't like math.
He educates his children well.
I was just being kind.
Tom's growing tomatoes in his garden.
I like to go fishing.
She gave me access to her records.
Aren't you Tom?
She looks shy.
This is made by Tom.
You can read French, right?
I've got a lot of sleep.
Be more precise.
I was on vacation.
No one will understand.
Tom goes out to drink every night.
The museum is closed today.
She gave me a shirt.
Tom didn't put his belt on.
You think you're funny?
That's what you decided.
Where's the library?
The boy put all his clothes in the bag.
Bring me the magazines.
She tied him up to the table.
I'm young.
The city is big.
He promised me he wouldn't tell anyone.
You owe it to me already?
Will you teach me to speak French?
You're cruel.
Tom's still tough.
The problem seems much more complicated.
Drinking water.
Don't worry.
Tom's not good lately.
I need to tell you something first.
One coffee, please.
I'm a widow.
Did I have another choice?
He's alone.
In China, we put the family first, and then the name.
Give it to him.
The pale boy reminded his father of the appearance.
He always manages to write to his mother at least once a week.
He looked right into my eyes.
Don't stop because of me.
How do you distinguish them?
Time's on our side.
Do you love your mother?
They've improved their results.
Don't bother them that much.
Where's the boss?
When can we say that a person has problems with alcohol?
Is there anyone at the station to meet me?
I haven't heard from him in a few months.
He's not playing both.
I read an exciting story.
Don't be afraid.
This question I understand somewhere.
Why aren't you here?
Tom is the man who gave me this bike.
We're not going to burn under the pressure of a tyrant.
Tom is a complete mystery.
I'm wearing sunglasses.
I don't know why Tom's so angry.
I'm so glad to see you again.
Don't make me stay here.
It's food.
Would you overload that?
Who's your favorite bird?
Everyone but me was invited.
I didn't say that either.
He loves geography and history.
Did you come here on your own?
Do you have subjects who speak French?
I don't have much to talk about in French.
Ask him about the way to the station.
Bill's been fishing all day.
I'm looking for my glasses.
I'm giving up.
My eyes are tired.
The passengers on the bus were fifty.
Tom works in the wine cellar.
Tom had nothing to do with it.
Who's listening to Tom?
I think Tom's asleep.
Children often cry because they want to pay attention to them.
I'm curious.
Please wake me up at six in the morning.
I feel uncomfortable with her.
We don't want you to feel pressured.
The staffs are dried grapes.
I was in India.
Coffee break is a tradition in America.
I told you what I know.
They have another plan.
Life is full of possibilities.
We were driving when we changed.
If you want anything, don't hesitate to tell me.
Tom wasn't that bad.
I can't find my glasses, I might have left them in the train.
Are you sure you don't want me to wait here with Tom?
You look tired.
He plays baseball after school.
The sound of the terrible letter made him shake.
Do you have this shirt in black?
It wasn't a holiday.
Emmy ordered a new dress.
I've seen you on TV.
Meg's talking too much.
I've dropped a lot of things.
I can't believe my eyes.
There's no place to worry.
We've got physical.
Are you having fun yesterday?
This sweater is worth over $50.
Just leave him with me.
I don't like doctors.
Tom refused to speak French.
Tom doesn't make Mary wait too long.
Tony didn't know what they were called.
That's for Tom.
This is where Tom was born.
My car's in service.
I've got an old bike.
Don't you speak English?
Tom won't let you pay.
Spread your shirts before they get stuck.
I'll be there.
Don't get too fast.
Why do you know that?
You're a cop.
I just don't want to see you disappointed.
His investment brought him 6%.
Let's have dinner.
I have to get to Tom.
Don't throw them away, then you'll need them.
Who's Tom's girlfriend?
He convinced his mother to give him extra money.
This book was easy.
I fixed his radio.
I went to Magistral 58.
I think Tom's afraid of you.
Don't let me die here.
I've never seen you so nervous.
I think we should go.
Untie your blouse, please.
I almost forgot him.
Tom can't forget the first time he and Mary had a serious fight.
You're in danger here.
I'll say I did it.
I have nothing.
If you need help, don't worry about looking for me.
We managed to get some foreign marks.
I was laughing.
It's hard to explain.
We got on a trip to Shinjuku.
The police are investigating the case.
You've been drinking since my hour.
It was cheaper than I thought.
How's the job going?
I wrote a few songs in French.
Nancy loves music.
The phone's a comfort.
Are you selling French newspapers?
Now the service is yours.
I'll be gone tomorrow.
I want something warm to drink.
Tom went there to study French.
I haven't said yes yet.
I barely got along with the nuns.
Don't talk to me.
What did you do with your camera?
Tom's very modest.
Thank you for that.
But the ball, the Turkish panic, uh, go ahead, Vancho, our captain.
I'll contact you as soon as I can.
I want to go to the same school Tom's planning to enroll.
The condition of the wounded is improving.
We've got a lot of lotus lists.
We are firmly convinced that when making statements, the author must avoid being subjected to the harmful habits present in the use of too many unnecessary words, which are actually absolutely excessive in the light of the whole sense.
Tom didn't see you.
Tom said, "Move, make your way and sit down.
I forgot his name.
Is Bob right?
I need to know.
When does it end?
It makes me sick every time I see blood.
Don't!
I thought we'd make it by 2:30.
Tom doesn't think Mary looks like her mother.
I've seen Tom do some pretty remarkable things.
He couldn't pass the test.
Almost all students love English.
God knows what can happen in an hour!
I fell asleep while reading a book.
She's late again.
He wasn't that strong.
I'm nothing king.
They've made their way through the crowd.
Bring him in.
I doubt Tom will stay.
It's too expensive!
Good-bye!
I think Tom wants to kill himself.
I don't want to sell my soul.
Tom, I have something to tell you.
The police searched the house and found two kilograms of heroin.
What color is Tom's dog?
Is that close to your house?
Jane made a statement.
I could make you happy.
Why is your French so good?
Fools run where angels are afraid to step.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
I've been doing sports my whole life.
I'll eat here.
I love tennis.
Do you allow me to come in?
Is it hard to learn French?
I've been waiting so long for it to happen.
Come on!
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
I'm very happy.
You don't have to say things like that when there's kids around here.
He pushes easy.
I want to improve my French speech.
You won't believe what I heard.
I'll study, Tom.
Today the train is ten minutes late.
There's a silence.
Are you absolutely sure you want to do that?
She didn't like him.
You're learning French, aren't you?
I have to go to the meeting.
I hope we find Tom.
Although I know a little French, I think we should speak English.
She's getting better.
What are you doing this weekend?
Aren't you nervous?
I need to talk to Tom now.
Checkmate's not opening.
Try to calm down.
We need to carry out an inquiry into the date of the test.
Maybe it's confusing us with the obvious.
Everyone dies.
Tom's a monk.
I have faith in you.
I'll listen to your advice.
A few days ago, my computer stopped working.
In Japan, almost every family has a laundry.
We're moving to Boston next week.
The garage flew away.
Will you marry me?
Close your books.
What exactly are you doing, what the scope of your research is, your main interest.
You're shaking.
I'm a little busy.
I thought I'd go say hello to Tom.
I think Tom may be drunk.
I've had a lot of headaches.
Why don't you sleep?
Mark Zuckerberg is an atheist, not a believer.
There's a little chance I can't get to the meeting.
He always said hello with a gift.
How should I know?
Wouldn't you go?
I think you should see this.
He can read pretty well.
Tom's okay, right?
She showed up in the paper for a while.
J.F. Kennedy was buried in the cemetery in Arlington.
I'm not giving up.
What are you interested in?
I could make you happy.
Carlos raised the mountain.
He added some sugar to the coffee.
Give me your shirt.
I'm not taking any medication.
You'll never be alone.
Does he have a big house?
I'm sorry, I don't have much time.
I couldn't understand his ideas.
He knows how to catch his audience.
He'll reach Hakodate tonight.
I'm not a tourist.
A man has to work.
Hello!
They eat apples.
I got her letter yesterday.
I've been a lot of fuss lately. My favorite football team in the West.
I've made it easy for him to connect to the sweet stories.
Tom didn't know what was wrong.
I know you're right.
I need to know what I saw that night.
I've been studying French for three years with a language teacher.
That's not my car.
If we don't leave soon, we won't get there until it's still light.
Tom's hurt.
His room's a mess.
They set aside part of their free time to care for the sick.
Are you sure you don't want us to come with you?
I really don't think Tom intends to go.
Ask Tom.
Let go of the radio.
I'll stay three more days.
We postponed our departure for tomorrow.
Nature doesn't know the boundaries.
I'm very happy in Georgia.
I'm busy with a lot of things.
I hear you think I'm crazy.
I'm a musician.
I need to know what the truth is.
If John had come, I wouldn't have to come.
You better get your sweater under your jacket.
I thought you'd be tired.
I think you're an idiot.
How complex is it?
I heard you laugh.
I totally erased it from my memory.
How can I leave?
You can't enter the museum.
He insisted on his own, even though I told him not to.
I didn't want to hurt Tom's feelings.
Tom's swimming fast.
Add this site to Preferred.
I have a lot to say about this.
I love my enemies.
I have no idea why.
That's affecting you.
The worst thing is, it wasn't always like that.
All the doctor's efforts were futile, and the man died soon.
I noticed you weren't at your house last night.
He's threatening us.
You want to buy this half.
He's a great brain surgeon.
Last month, I was right.
He can speak French as well.
Are you going?
Let's change the subject.
It was very interesting at school.
They took them to the library with new books.
I couldn't speak French.
Can I go now?
Whatever you say, I won't give up.
I've been in French for the last three years.
I'm much bigger than you.
He only eats fruit.
It wasn't that funny.
Either he or I'm wrong.
You're learning French, aren't you?
The girl used to play alone.
He's playing in a group.
The birds were asleep.
Tom's doing his job at 5:00.
Although Tom left home early today, he's late for work.
I'd rather not speak French.
It was terrible, wasn't it?
He looks strong.
That's how you feel.
The time will come when she will regret what she said.
Think about it, please.
The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
Did they get the bus to the museum?
Is he your teacher?
Watch out for him.
Be right.
What else do you want to read?
There's a golden rule: whoever has the gold, he determines the rules.
The house is inhabited by spirits.
Tom's going to town.
Everything that's not forever is forever old.
You're early again.
Tom got married when he was 30.
I helped Tom do his homework.
Can I help you?
You don't always agree with your boss.
I bought it for $10.
You don't have to go.
Tom lives alone in a big house.
Did you go to the beach with Tom?
I don't care.
Did you hear Tom speak French?
A beautiful bay, isn't it?
You really speak French pretty well.
Say hi, Jimmy.
I heard what you said.
Tom didn't try to hide the truth.
I think you should choose Tom.
Something's going on.
Am I clear?
Many parents worry that their children do not have basic knowledge of numbers.
I finished philosophy at my university.
Which beach do you like to go to?
You can always give part of the work of younger servants.
Maybe that's the problem.
She's a very beautiful girl.
Tom can't do it.
Whatever you're doing, you can't make a person believe in something less than yourself.
I don't feel very well.
The climate doesn't work.
You're sitting in my place.
Don't you think something's gonna scare you?
Everyone agrees with you.
Tom encouraged me to learn French.
I want a MP3 player!
Where's Tom hiding?
I'm worried when I think about it.
I paid two hundred dollars of taxes.
I think you should check under the bed.
That's not gonna happen again.
Because of you, I did it.
Stop it or I'll let you know.
We need Tom's help.
She's an atheist.
There's nothing to worry about.
There's something I need to take care of.
I can't accept the invitation because I have another commitment.
When I first met Tom, he couldn't speak French.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
What the hell is this?
Is there anything else I can help you with?
I have no intention of giving up for a little bit of this watch, and not even talking about sharing with it finally.
He couldn't get the job.
I think you're gonna do great.
Tom wanted to leave, but Mary wanted to stay a little longer.
I think we have enough food.
I'll be on the next bus.
Mary made eggs sandwiches.
What did you see?
I bathe every morning in the summer.
Lock your shirt.
Read it again.
I wouldn't be so sure if I were you.
I think you're crazy.
Unfortunately, I didn't get there in time for his speech.
I prefer grapefruits in front of the oranges.
This place deserves to visit at least once.
He kept reading the book.
Are you sure you don't want one?
I like that color.
Just accept it.
Her sister poured out her blouse.
I told you that again, didn't I?
Why do you keep saying there's too much time?
I'll see you tomorrow.
I don't want your gold or your silver.
I forgot to close the door.
I'd like a orange juice.
Since the moment I took your book, until I left it, I've been turning around all the time, and one day I'm thinking about starting to read it.
I tried to argue with Tom.
The fighter's bent for the round.
That's what I've seen.
Delphine's kind of a bunny.
What color are these?
He searched his son's shoulder.
Tom heard something and wondered what it could be.
Tom asked me to stay.
I don't want to be involved.
I'm not taking drugs.
I'm dying to see Paris.
On Mother's Day, I gave my mother nineteen flowers.
I think you're absolutely right.
If peace cannot be maintained with honor, it ceases to be peace.
She took the room with beautiful furniture.
Job calculators can buy at the price of a pair of socks and are needed for thousands of British children in school, not less than the paint and rubber.
This is the hospital Tom was born in.
You don't have to wait here.
And Tom and Mary covered their eyes.
This is my baby.
I'll give you all the information you need.
Stop whining.
You can't just go and abuse people.
Don't open those windows.
I'm not insured.
I'll take the money.
She's cooking for college.
I think you're really amazing.
Looks like everything Tom wants is money.
I'm not coming with you.
For the cold time when you want to drink something hot, I recommend this type of thermos.
Tom's looking around like a chicken without a head.
Greece is an ancient country.
Several people visited the meeting.
He dressed his coat and got out of the house.
Tatoeba's new site will flush out the home hyper database, built by the basics search engine, and will go to the tattoo-OS server with the tattoo CPU, made entirely from the tattoo.
The old man stopped her.
She hated being called a coward.
I like it so much.
I've never voted.
Where's the bathroom?
Just go to your room.
I'll be back in time for dinner.
I totally forgot.
She gave me a nice gift.
Are you coming?
Let's meet at 2:30.
The crown is the symbol of kings.
I have no intention of apologizing to Tom.
What are you doing?
During my vacation, I read all Milton's work.
What are you recommending me?
I'm sure Tom didn't even notice you're late.
I'll meet him at the bus stop.
Every student was asked one question.
Are you sure you want me to sell it?
I'm really worried about your future.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I haven't seen you around here before.
It's very hot today.
Don't be quick to protect me.
Who's Greece's capital?
Tom can't speak French, Mary can't speak French, either.
I met her for the first time in London.
Can Tom come tomorrow?
Look where you're going.
They described the girl as a little bit.
Tom didn't get used to the city life.
Keep your promise.
I forgot about that.
I think you're putting too much sugar on it.
Do you like Mexican food?
I'll take you home.
Man is the only animal using fire.
All the flowers in the garden are inflated.
They made us work all day.
We chose him as president.
No kidding?
I've seen these pictures.
If I hadn't noticed, I'd tell you.
What's the minimum wage in Luxembourg?
His fate is predestined.
Are those candles?
If you have to choose between a piano and a brick, which one would you choose?
The answer is true.
I think that's great.
Did he pass the test?
Don't miss the bus.
Be careful not to break Tom's heart.
We went there for a week.
That's good.
That kind of thing is dangerous.
I think you better go to bed.
I like you so much.
I called the bell.
The wolves are moving on mussels.
Do you have medical insurance?
Watch out, Tom!
The museum is closed on Sunday.
I've been teaching Russian for three years.
We're married to each other.
Tom won't give up.
It'll cost about 10,000 yen.
Tom speaks French as good as Mary.
How hungry are you?
That guy's stable.
I almost won.
That wasn't my fault.
Did you cut the paper?
I don't care what happens.
I saw you with Tom.
Tom's my friend.
You're looking at this the wrong way.
Something's going on.
Fill it up.
We have a little chance of success.
Let's go ask her.
I can only wonder if that's the same for everyone else.
Are you sure you want to throw it away?
Tom speaks French.
The situation has improved with regard to what it was.
I played you.
His joke was great.
The police will investigate the crime.
The stories you will read in this book deal with some of the many problems young people face.
I've been waiting a long time for this moment.
Can you explain a little more detailed?
Am I wrong?
Tom didn't want Mary holding his hand.
I think we should study things.
So we're all in agreement.
If time allows, I'll go to the museum.
That tie is really good for you.
I think you're gonna be a great father.
There's no way you can contact him.
Never give up, never give up.
Would you show me this bag?
That's my computer.
Bern is the capital of Switzerland.
You won't believe me.
Can you come to nine?
Let's sync the clocks.
I shop every morning.
I wish I could speak French like you.
Please don't do this.
Is this a free store?
I'm looking for a gift for my friend.
And if I had told you, I'd have told you.
This is the camera Tom took the photos with.
Look, don't lose yourself.
I'm tired of changing my plans every time you decide you want something else.
It looks like a man far away.
We worked hard to tie both ends.
Good morning.
John's grandmother died after a long illness.
I have to rest.
She said she wouldn't move and ink, no matter what she was saying.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
The respondent was given the right to appeal.
Let's not rush.
My father went fishing.
They didn't offer me anything to eat.
You don't have to make quick conclusions.
Don't worry.
He gave up.
The wine is the milk of adults.
Tom opens the windows every morning as soon as he enters his office.
I can't work with you if you don't trust me.
That was years ago.
I'm dreaming nightmares.
When Tom woke up, he found out that Mary was missing.
I've seen these pictures.
I'm as strong as you are.
I've never been to Europe.
I'm unemployed.
Why don't we take a cab?
I hope I'm not too late.
I came home with a train.
Why are you always so angry?
Uwe!
That's why you didn't want to come with me?
Did you decide what you wanted to order?
I put the boy to a deep sleep.
She called it how she didn't.
Are we capable of that?
My sister's name is Patricia.
I should have opened my suitcase.
We discussed whether to cancel the reservation.
The kids thought their parents were made of money.
The swimmers were lined up from the cold.
It's allowed for dogs.
The kids are the flowers in our lives.
I had to cancel the invitation because I was sick.
Tom wouldn't be so stupid.
They hated Tom.
Keep moving.
It's a challenge for me, and I'm learning a lot.
Tom was out of his mind.
I've been counting on her.
Don't look at Tom.
I have to pay for him.
I want to marry you.
Calm down.
That's one of the fish Tom caught.
Okay, let's go.
The car's coming.
Looks like we're gonna make it in time.
Being a troll is art.
I ordered you a beer.
I haven't seen him in about three years.
Let's play baseball.
She's a bodybuilder.
The man eats bread.
He's crossing the river.
You don't remember, and I'll never forget.
