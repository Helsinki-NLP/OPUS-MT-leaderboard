Re-election of the Republican Party against Obama
Republican leaders have justified their policy of combating electoral fraud.
Brennan’s centre, however, denotes such fraud as myth that the electoral fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people who die after the strike of lightning.
In the last ten years, only 300 cases of election fraud have been reported by the Republican lawyers in the United States.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures are partly undermining the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States has responsibility for organizing federal elections by individual states.
And in this spirit, most American governments since 2009 have issued new laws that make the election process difficult or a record of the election list difficult.
This event was followed by a series of elections in November 2010, during which 675 new Republican representatives arrived in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 legislative proposals limiting the right to vote in 41 countries were submitted only in 2011.
The new electoral laws require voters to submit an identity card with photographs and documents on American citizenship.
In addition, these laws limit pre-election periods, deprive the right to register on the election day of the voters and deprive citizens of the right to vote in the criminal register.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state requested a photo identification card from the voters.
The first state that introduced this requirement was Indiana.
The Constitution of the Indian Law confirmed in 2008 the U.S. Supreme Court.
The Republican authorities have made rapid progress in extending this process to other States.
In the last two years, the proposals for such laws have been supported in 34 states with the aim of forcing voters to submit identity cards with photographs.
It should be noted that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people at the age of electing, have no identification of the photographs issued by the government of their state.
Furthermore, there is no evidence of this identity of about five million new volunteers in 2012.
In addition, the installation of the required identification card is often worth more than a hundred dollars.
New restrictions are disproportionately affecting young people, minority members and low-income persons.
25% of African Americans, 15% of people under $35,000; 18% of citizens aged 65 and 20% of volunteers aged 18 to 29 are therefore not required to identify the photograph.
And that's not all.
Students who, as voters, are familiar with their attachment to democratic candidates, are not allowed to use their identity card with a photo shown by their school in several countries.
On the other hand, the same Member States shall allow members of fishing or fishing clubs who choose more Republican candidates to use the cards issued by these clubs in elections.
By 2004 no State had requested a citizenship document in the elections.
The first such request was brought by Arizona.
Since 2011, about twelve States have adopted laws which provide for the obligation of volunteers to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Spanish minority.
It is important to note that two out of three Hispanics give preference to the democratic side.
In 2011, the Republican legislators supported the eight states of the law that violates the register of voters on the day of election.
They also restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those who wish to register.
These restrictions have their consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general elections, campaigning for registration of voters helped about 10 million people.
The measures taken after 2009 led to a decrease in the recording of new volumes in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
The Republican legislators then adopted laws aimed at shortening the pre-election period in five other countries.
For example, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of African-American voters were elected, although only 13% of African-American voters in that country were elected.
It was the same with the Spanish.
They made only 11% of all people, but 24% of the people voting in front.
On the other hand, the whites who represented 76% of all the voters made only 46% of the voters who elected in the front.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have made a very important contribution to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
The democratic governors blocked a number of bill proposals with their own veto.
In order to delay the validity of the most controversial laws, the Attorney General of the United States even intervened.
In part, their damage has been limited.
For example, only 16 of the 34 States have adopted laws requiring the submission of a photo identification card.
However, the new rules introduced make the exercise of voting rights particularly difficult in 2012.
The democratic criticisms speak primarily of the presumption of approved laws and consider them a clear effort to influence the outcome of the 2012 elections in key states.
Brennan's 2011 report shows that the States where these laws were approved represent 171 of 270 votes in the voter's assembly necessary for victory in the presidential elections.
It is too soon to declare with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain already today: these new provisions will have an adverse impact on election participation.
In this sense, these measures are partly undermining the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: Whether or not to complete the investigation?
The PSA test resulted in a slight error of negative or even negative results, leading to unnecessary medical advances.
All of this has increased the weight of men who have already tried to investigate even to go.
Let's investigate or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
The studies conducted in the United States showed a high level of contamination among individual tested groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and to make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found a difference between the patients who underwent the investigation and those who did not.
This study also demonstrated after a 12-year derogation that those who fail to investigate have a higher risk of metastases of 30 to 40%.
So I recommend a 50-year-old examination or 40-year-old if your immediate relative had prostate cancer.
The most dangerous group is also African-American men.
The key is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is discovered.
There are aggressive types of cancer and such species that are inexhaustible.
It is therefore necessary to correctly explain to the patient the level of risk of its type of cancer, offer possible alternatives, not necessarily treat prostate cancer that does not affect life in the long term, and focus in these cases rather on active surveillance of the disease.
Today, a number of men with cancer are not treated because their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not endanger their lives.
Let us suggest that they be more actively monitored and offer them treatment in the event of disease progress.
We are increasingly and more precise in determining the criteria that help in deciding which type of treatment and which one does not.
However, I recommend that the investigation be completed.
However, it is important to complete the interview with your doctor and determine whether an examination is appropriate or not.
In cooperation with the International Urological Society, the Movember movement has created a tool that enables assessment for and against the PSA investigation.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle for cancer prevention.
Despite advances in research, the best way to reduce the risk of disease is to adopt the principles of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthy and moved sufficiently, up to 30% of cancer cases could be avoided.
"If everyone stopped smoking, this data would amount to at least 50%," urges André Beaulieu, a Canadian cancer research spokesperson.
On the contrary, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers cause hereditaryity.
Some percentage remains unexplained.
For the Canadian cancer research company, the fight against smoking remains a priority, although the number of smokers decreases.
Cigarettes are 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
It's an insomniatous human health.
"There are still 1.5 million chickens in Quebec today," and the speaker, André Beaulieu, has been turning his head.
Exciting data: 10 years after the smoker stops smoking, the risk of death to cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
Physicality and obesity are, according to the SCC, another risk factor for disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, fat stomach and endoline, stomach, intestines and joints.
"It follows from the research that regular body activity throughout life protects against cancer of the colon," the report adds.
Surviving
That organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
Too high consumption can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also appropriate to avoid the risks for which the same applies.
Preservation of meat by digestion, drying or salt may lead to the production of carcinogens.
"They can cause damage to the body's cells and lead to cancer development," the report adds.
Vitamins
In recent times, different scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, research has not yet brought a clear conclusion.
Studies based on vitamin E are fragmented according to the SCC.
Although the risk of prostate cancer may be reduced, another study says that it is increasing.
Nor has the effect of vitamin D on cancer been clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu continues to see how important it is to talk about his concerns and his family history with his doctor.
"The investigation doesn't mean you're going to have cancer."
Higgs' bobond was examined
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs Bosnu caused a legitimate blow in the summer.
There is a view that this bonnet is divided into a mechanism that is responsible for all mass in the universe.
And then it's the last particle, whose existence predicts a standard model - our best or "at least bad" explanation of nature and mass behavior - that has not yet been empirically observed.
However, among physics, there is no clear evidence that Higgs's bobon.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle, which is very much like Higgs's bonnet, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data published this week during the large physical congress in Kyoto confirm it rather, but still missing all the data so that we can have absolute certainty.
But let's assume that it's Higg's bobon, because the risk of failure appears to be small, and let's look at what the eye actually does.
In this world, there is a completely indisputable law, according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and do not try too hard on it, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it shows that a similar law applies to it: Pauli's exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot take the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" roughly creates some of their properties.
It also divides physical particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we find organized citizens, or farmers, who respect Paul’s principle.
And at the other end, the boobs are moving, according to anarchists who don't care about anything at all - certainly not this principle, which means they can be at the same place at the same time.
These boons are further divided into two groups according to the device (but absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in Berkeley's laboratories: the messes that we leave here without notice, and the "force particles", which expands to great natural forces and which Higgs boons are probably associated with in some way.
It must be said, however, that these boobs are not as exotic as they might be thought.
If you read this article, it's thanks to a bonnet with unusual banality: photon, or "parts of light", which is "the carrier" of electromagnetic forces.
If the particles with the electrical charge accelerate or change their direction, they will "break up" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a shell thrown into a fisher.
From this "distortion" there will be electromagnetic waves (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing but a photomechanical wave - and thus one of the Bosnons, "power bearers".
More stable fields
It's also with Higgs Bosne, but with the difference that "to destroy" is another field, Higgs's field to show up.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; its excitement must reach very high energy values, as in the frozen fisher’s level, which is already very high.
For this reason, it is necessary to use as large accelerometer of the part as a accelerator in the laboratory CERN - a large hadron accelerometer with cutting connections is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - in order to develop such energy.
Analog with the electromagnetic field is again suitable for explaining the relationship between Higgs and the mass.
The electromagnetic field does not respond to all particles or all materials.
Some, for example, magnets do, but others do not - piece paper, for example, will never hold on to the refrigerator.
And it is equally true that with Higgs field they do not react to all the particles: those who do so have a certain amount of mass, while others (such as photos, let's look at it) do not have it.
And Mrs. Novakov is wondering what all these research is, what will they bring us?
From the point of view of science, it is the confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to examine any mismatch between observation and the predictions of the SM.
In addition, the lack of physics literally wants to be able to find it, because the smaller difference could open the space of "new physics" and start some gaps in the model.
It is necessary to note that the model has so far a huge deficit, does not provide any explanation of gravity (ooha!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the universe mass (including oohha!).
However, CERN has not been able to detect such a dispute so far.
Responses
The answers to these studies in your daily life can only be very difficult, but it would be a mistake to think that there will be no one.
Look, at the very beginning of the 1960s, laser propellers in Bell's labs had no idea of the revolution they're already calling for.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
The physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (the previous paprish were pulsed) in 1962, I have already said that - the laser was originally considered such a "laboratory toy".
Just imagine...
In addition, the application may result from all the tools that surround the research.
For example, Willard Boyle created a small light recorder in 1969 during his work focused on optics.
This recording, even though Boyle didn't plan it at first, now serves as the "eye" of all the digital cameras in the world and gave him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, it doesn't mean that activities around LHC have to change our lives, but it means that people don't really know...
Palliative care - the best way to get out of life...
By means of its Commission for the Honorable Death, Quebec has recently taken part in a horrendous issue concerning the end of life.
The debate should be continued soon and the bill is coming forward.
There is still much work to be done in this key area.
Le Devoir’s magazine tried to look at this question more closely.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Monterégie.
The cancer of the prostate that fed her gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years of life and it's seven," she says without emotion in her bed at the house for the palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he says.
Immorality has done its job: Immoderate weakness makes it impossible for him to take himself to the toilet or just eat himself.
He looks at the deliciously looking breakfast and agrees that we can help him eat.
He's brave and even smiles, he talks to strangers who stop at him, he's bringing him drugs, he's offering a bath.
It's a good idea. It's a good idea.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of that entrance, it humiliates me," she confesses.
A few hours later, he found a team of doctors on his drug problem.
"A man learns all his life that men are wetting clothes," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist in Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the stage of the child is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the ability of the person to accept the return, the psychologist claims.
In the opinion of a number of people who are caring for palliative care, the essential moments are played in the very core of such a return.
Patients who go to the home with the palliative care of Victor-Gadbois suffer from all cancer.
Their prognosis is no more than three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who care for them does not provide so-called "medical" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89 years old, it's the worst fear of dying "to breathe with full consciousness".
But the weakness made it possible for me to reveal my children.
"I have good kids," he says.
"I no longer have any wishes in life," she says, and then lets us put on her breathing device.
Yet he is still looking forward to the last visit of his son from Italy in the following days.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers, care is provided for the body with food.
So it looks like a palliative care that's going on if there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec there is one bed of palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little if we realize that we're all going to die once.
Here life continues under optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at home.
Whether it's a level of physical, emotional, or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, for example, a brandy or a pepsi can be given, according to taste.
Diabetes don't have to watch sugar levels anymore.
And death is part of everyday life here.
Last night they brought Mr. X's beer, which he died later in the night.
This morning, he'll drink his son's beer to the honor of his late father.
"We help patients just as close to them," says Nathalie Savard, director of the care service.
In Victor-Gadbois's house, they're going after each other for days, but they don't like each other.
In addition to a 30-year-old man, who rejoices at his last meeting with his family carefully exposed to the pillows, while he is being treated with respect, a tragic 16-year-old man dies surrounded by his parents, a woman and two young children after he has tried all the options to survive.
"For a year and a half, there are always three to five beds, which are designed for people with cancer for 45 years," says Dr. Christiane Martelová.
53% of patients coming to Victor-Gadbois' house, coming here from their homes, 47% from the hospital.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care, which is intended to alleviate the suffering as soon as the patient grows into the final phase of his life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the nursing home.
And several organizations, such as Victor-Gadbois home and the Grand Montreal Home Palliative Treatment Society, specialize more specifically in the care provided to oncology patients.
And this fundamental lack of medical care in Quebec leads to the fact that a number of doctors specializing in palliative care are concerned with the adoption of the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, it has been manifestly signed in the area of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure that all people have access to quality palliative care before it is possible to agree with euthanasia.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in emergency pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to heal her.
It is feared that patients should not be asked to die for the reason that they are not adequately cared for.
At the same time, it is true that a number of oncologists care for their patients until the last moments, regardless of the adverse forecast.
The hopes for the survival of Hélène Richards were already minimal when she left the drug therapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was out of treatment, she answered that she was sorry that I was stopping fighting, and she told us.
And then she told me it was over!
There is no omnipotent care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who want to die thank their treating doctors for not fulfilling their wishes when their palliative monkeys eased their pain.
It must be said, however, that palliative care is certainly not all - powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, the director of palliative care in the Grand Montreal Home palliative care community, patients are prevented from treating pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, physicians often use palliative sedatives, which the patient will be able to sleep until the end of the day, either permanently or permanently.
We cannot face the fact that we do not experience this part of suffering.
The patient we do not relieve of pain will have an ever-increasing possibility of access to palliative sedatives.
The powerless without sedatives, they always say the same thing, "I want to die."
But it doesn't always have to mean "I want you to give me euthanasia," it means "I want you to get rid of my pain."
The implementation of this report made it possible for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Extensive reality scandals in Quebec
Travel officials, construction and public works entrepreneurs, political party lobbyists and Italian mafia experts are still telling us what they know about the amazing "system", where construction, state officials, politicians, experts and mafia are involved.
This "field" came to Quebec taxpayers very expensive especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system has broken up since we took the basic measures," said ironically Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former police chief in Montreal.
As a result, in 2011 he launched a scandal on the basis of a thorough investigation of the financing in connection with the construction contracts in Quebec, which then liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest approved until after long delays.
The Duchesneau report confirmed the direct link between industry, the transparent financing of the parties and the corruption of state officials.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he says, "only the Ministry of Transport has been saving billions of dollars' contracts," when some people kept their instincts in check to get a share on them!
Charbonneau's commission "which led to the demise of two mayors," he adds with hope that she will be able to "discover the zeal of some people".
Standing Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The permanent unit for the fight against corruption established in 2011 is also involved in the fight against its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
To that end, the "Marteau's family" politicians, who since 2009, have made sure that the visual "money card" significantly mitigates the inflaming of orders...
In recent weeks, they have carried out a number of visits and complained about the fraud and corruption of a number of general representatives, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of one of the localities.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
It is suspected that he has repeatedly accepted payments in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have already been received by transport engineers from Montreal and Italian-born entrepreneurs, such as Tony Accurus and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito triggered a sensation when the Commission explained the "system" mechanism for obtaining public contracts.
During these years, he himself committed 3% of the value of the orders he received in Montreal, a mediator associated with the Mafia, who then transferred the money to the Union of Montreal, for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay was running.
After 2000, Zambito was generous to all sides and dedicated more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about EUR 68,000) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were then in power.
He also acknowledged that he had organised an illegal screening of funds for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with financial institutions whose prices have exceeded
In Montreal, there was a "system" of corruption very chili.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described it very carefully before the commission: during ten years he received a gift from the construction companies, a call for trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and a total of $736 000 in exchange for a cash flow contract at which he exceeded the price.
Other public actors in the transport sector have admitted that they have let themselves be paid for by 30% to 40% overestimating invoices through false multiplications.
The mayor's organizer Martin Dumont later accused Tremblaye of turning his eyes on the contemporary budget without any interruption, which brought dirty money into his treasury.
On the basis of these findings, Tremblay withdrew at the beginning of November, throwing Montreal into a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first speakers to issue a warning signal.
As the mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, it has been working against the sale of the state-of-the-art land purchased for 5 million dollars and sold for... 1.6 million promoters directly in the middle of the flourishing real estate trade.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will finally be launched, says that "it is pulling the strings in an effort to understand the operation of the promoted antagonist system to stop gangrene and catch the culprits".
It says the process is "sick, but positive".
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but it is necessary to establish a separate investigation unit in Montreal and ensure that these questionable practices cannot be returned.
It's like she's cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public actors have cut off hundreds of millions of dollars", but he fears in particular the role of "experts informed of this plague", if they have not been involved in these trades!
It estimates that 70% of the funding of election campaigns in Quebec comes from dirty money, and with irony it adds: "I heard it was just a bad turnout of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit gifts to $100, but according to it, the situation does not resolve: "Unless election expenditure is strictly limited, dirty money will not disappear from politics."
It proposes a comprehensive control of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: "We can no longer reduce it; if we courageously focus on the basis of things, we can rebuild on a stronger basis and with greater control and enforcement of the laws."
If this story was painted in Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends that everyone who smiles at him to look at their own castle...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
In this season, you and the PSG have set a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
You can explain to her that all the individuals went to themselves, or just the new size of the PSG.
The big players came to us.
Every day I get next to them.
The technical team helped me a lot too.
Every day, these realities make it possible for me to increase the level of games.
And in the fights, it's easier.
It's all going so fast in football.
But I'm not losing my mind.
From the beginning of my treatment in the INF Clairefontaine until after I moved to Saint-Etienne, I've always considered a single degree.
So you're using the competitive environment that took Carlo Ancelotti...
The poses of this year are common to play matches at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it turns out that a player like me then has a greater taste for running and wants to give maximum performance.
And also, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in relation to my position.
My hand has assistants like Claude Makele who played in the same position as me.
And does Ancelotti have a decisive word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has respect for all techniques.
Today he is not equal in the 1st league and is one of the best European coaches.
He's had a lot of experience, and he's got a lot of titles with the top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he wins another titles in Paris.
In January, I graduated from a calming conversation with him.
I had a lot of injuries behind me.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
In the 1st floor, Lyon took our lead.
But we're stuck in the curtain.
One of our main goals is the League of Masters: very easy to get into the eighth grade.
What's your club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Anything can happen now.
But we certainly want to be a tough opponent for the quality of European teams.
We want to win our team first in front of Port, so we can play at the eight-finals at home.
Can the PSG be in the short term with a large European club?
I've got a budget for that.
To become a great European club in Paris, it has to win titles and sign up in history.
It's not like that today.
On the financial side, PSG has the means to achieve this objective.
And would it be a great failure not to win in the 1st league as in the last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year we really want to win a league title.
We've been missing enough in last season.
We were disappointed in May because we had to win.
We had a great season.
We collected 79 points.
It usually pays to be with 79 points you're a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had even more amazing season.
I think this is going to happen this year.
Even though the title is used by large teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think we have weapons available to defeat them.
Do you think the media from the PSG are expecting too much?
It's not unusual to expect a lot of us because of what we've invested in here and what we have players.
That's what we're accepting.
It's true that if we beat Troyes 4:0 at home and there's still something going on in our newspapers, it's not exactly nice.
A man asks what more people can want from you.
Of course, he can't win 4:0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game style.
You need time to build a team.
In the League of Masters, we proved that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, which was no longer going to the eighth grade in the second season, and they also invested large amounts!
In view of the amounts invested, it would be expected that you will have 15 points ahead!
You're insulting the other clubs and the French league.
Lyon and Marseille clubs, which did not happen too much last season, moved to another stage with the new PSG.
This shows how amazing the 1st league is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say that in spite of all our difficulties, we have been able to win.
It seems like the PSG in everything depends on the performance of the Golden Ibrahimic.
It's a good thing it's said there's "dependence on the Golden."
This means that Ibrahim is very effective and gives a lot of goals.
That's why he came here to prove he's a 1st League star.
Everywhere he went, he proved to be a great player, a world star.
In our team, we respect people and players.
And he respects the people he has around him.
What he's achieved is truly exceptional.
This also led others to increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also makes it possible for others to grow next to him.
How did you live Euro 2012 with French representation?
As a disappointment.
I really wanted to play this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of the injury, I couldn't play the way I imagined.
But I did, and I got out stronger.
I'm having a good fight today, too.
And that's what I've been hoping for since I started to represent.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe ourselves to be exemplary.
How do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps in front of the national team?
He's talking about the results.
We're in a good place at MS.
The coach picks tight, is close to the players and can breathe for victory.
That's how Laurent Blanc was.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the euro.
I hope Didier Deshamps will bring our team to Brazil.
Is the regiment (1:1) of October 16 in Spain a solid starting match?
This battle has given us self-consciousness.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I didn't experience this kind of battle for my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin you can pay and sell without a bank
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and cost of processing between recipients.
As in these technologies is more often the truth, there is a clear political outlook: the belief that the current financial system built on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, the inventor of Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), represents both virtual money (but convertible to dollars, euro...), a secure translation protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between two partners.
Thanks to the 15,000 computers involved in the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites are already receiving bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin price first reached a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later dropped to 2 dollars, today it is moving at the border of about 10 dollars (the price is listed on the bitcoincharts.com page).
Compared to the world exchange for real money or financial products, this is nothing impressive.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on the virtual finances that emerged in October.
Bitcoin refers to "the most successful virtual money", "competition dollar and euro" and "the period of normal money".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money by being used as "credit" for the procedure in the video game that a person gets or can buy (and also swap back).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Every month, however, the central authority controls and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all net depositors of ordinary accounts, controllers, issuers of money and buyers and sellers are all net.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually carried out between two e-mail addresses.
However, the user can choose another address for each payment, providing anonymity.
The information file relating to this transaction is electronically signed by the two-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the validity of the transaction.
Thanks to the file content, it is further possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public book of regular accounts distributed throughout the network.
The key phase is in recording this new transaction into this book.
It is carried out through the resolution of the mathematical task assigned to computers whose solver, such as a temporary central banker, will be entitled to write this additional order.
This is a phase of file splitting; that is to convert a huge file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it, then the whole thing "cut off".
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific print (very zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes easily check its correctness.
The transaction will then be irrefutablely displayed linked to the chain of all other transactions; any adjustments would be made to change the print.
If the user wants to pay the same money twice very quickly for the purpose of fraud (up to ten minutes), the network confirms only one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned because each of them has different prints.
A computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this remuneration is regularly divided into two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is so limited by the number of 21 million, but it can be divided into stamilion, so the space for the margin here is...
The burden of the task is also increased by an increasing level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its rise and fall.
The sites that provide Bitcoin services have been attacked and the protected bitcoins have been removed.
"The shed used does not concern the protocol itself," assures Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But this problem pays for cash.
Important players like Wikipedia reject gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dori Ron of the Weizman Constitution in Israel recently analyzed the book of regular accounts and showed that almost 80% of the bitcoins are not running.
In November, the "great discounts" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," is pleased Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, a bitcoin converting to gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the pedagogical book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent credit card (with real money) or wireless payment mobile, but uses Bitcoin system to verify transactions that are cheaper because of it.
The carrier also manages its identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system is easily configured for traders where you do not need to install new terminals or software.
Just tell the address that can be "photographed and recognized" by the phone, explains Pierre Noizat, who ensures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question the hierarchical systems and the transition to more horizontal systems.
"Before Bitcoin breaks out, it will take a while, but 2013 could be decisive," she predicts.
In addition, in its report, the ECB expects to reassess the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this type of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What else?
The French units left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and US units should follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not expect everything from us.
The greatest harm was suffered by the people in the Afghan countryside, whom we punished because we considered them terrorists.
And we, too, are about 88 killed soldiers, and what are all these injuries and freezes?
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leading representatives who fled to Pakistan, but often are rurals who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They only want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though they were added to them by the jihadists, the Pakistani, the Arab, the Uzbek, the Tadjik.
Now they enjoy tolerances and often help local rebels, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will decrease.
The departure of the French units from the base of Nijrab, which I was following from the peaks of the mountains planted by the Mandlons through the French loans, took place on an orderly basis.
The convoys of trucks and parked vehicles arrived in Kabul without an attack on the air traffic of the helicopter.
Since the end of 2014, the Taliban will not be so active in Kabul.
The conditions have changed significantly between 1994 and 1996 from their unstoppable procedure.
The cabul was ten times empty and the country was in blood and fire as a result of the fights between different combat groups.
Their takeover of control over the country was then considered to be a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the darkness of these peasants, who were completely controlled by Al-Ká'ida, but their situation has not improved in our time.
Some Mujahedinas, the Afghan government and the current Taliban agree to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main values of the war against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became captains, strengthened state land sold as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge US orders for subcontractors.
They were discredited; most of them were neither at all in the battle.
According to what I've heard in campaigns, people are looking for a government that won't make thieves.
A number of young people want to leave as they leave those who have managed to use American generosity: the loss of capital is significant.
Young people are already tired of war and associated ideologies.
During the exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they met the modern world and its benefits impressed them.
About 65% of the population is 25 years of age; in Kabul there are currently 5 million inhabitants, five of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of girls and boys.
These young people will have to provide work, they no longer want to return to the darkness of the former, or to the corruption of some representatives.
Everyone, including armed opposition, likes mobile phones; television and Turkish series that show the modern world are watching everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that stand in her forehead be considered legitimate?
Some commanders of the battle against the Soviet army are already rebuilding provincial militias that will be out of control of the central power.
Afghanistan, a country with a strong local identity, should enjoy a certain degree of decentralisation following the pattern of Western states, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralised state with a strong presidential influence, so the Prime Minister's post that existed since the Constitution was adopted in 1964 was abolished.
President Karzaí does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
His country, however, has been heavily dependent on foreign aid for the past 50 years.
No industry has been able to rebuild, no partition is working, no basic wetting system has been fixed.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, but fruit and vegetables.
Advantage has a private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
The news spread that Afghanistan has enormous ungrowth wealth.
And it just felt like the Western states were here just to strengthen it.
Without energy to process iron or copper locally and without means to transport raw materials across the mountains, there is no need for growth.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the goal of the Mess Aynak castle and left international archaeological teams (in support of the World Bank) to explore the vast Buddhist area to preserve the role of the most important employer in the entire province.
One day, it will also be necessary to restore normal relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depends on a large proportion of imports and exports.
The departure of the French military units was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of common types of assistance: girls and boys lycea, French universities, French institutions, cooperation in military, legal, health and agricultural areas, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the initiative "to acquire the heart and soul" has served to reconcile aid and military activities with the service of "cimic-armed steps" of the Ministry of Defence, which was abolished in 2012, but has been achieved thanks to the numerous French non-governmental organization of a number of achievements in the area of common interest and agricultural reconstruction in the ten mountain villages.
These activities involving the number of local workers have helped to resolve the rise: wetting, cold, drinking water, deforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of processing areas.
What memories do we have of two billion euros of military spending?
A much smaller budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very demanding in these valleys, which are often over 2,000 m above sea level.
The municipality received dozens of written requests for small agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Kapis.
In order to free these farmers from the rise of foreign groups, they want, according to their words, to achieve undue civil assistance in their behalf, which would be properly controlled and directly affected.
Hard work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Muhammad Mursí left for the next part of the poker.
While Egypt remains in its history the most divided for the declaration of the constitution, which temporarily grants it unlimited power, has decided to play vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of the opinion of all the others, that the Constitutional Assembly would adopt a final text tomorrow.
A few weeks ago, the head of the State gave the meeting another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using the provisional text, which has been added many times, which weakens the constitutional stability of the country and leads to legal developments.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the country's dispersal.
From the point of view of the opposition, the President is suspending in his "autocrat delirium", continues to "disobedience his word" and "abstains the right".
However, its members ensure that it is a means, as soon as possible, to deal with the constitutional and political crisis and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in two weeks.
It is a very brief passage of time, which makes the Brotherhood withdraw from the Egyptians’ intention to explain the article after the article.
For the President, it is also about how to regain national and democratic legitimacy while the protests are being rejected throughout the country.
As Muhammad Mursí confirmed in his interview for the American weekly Time, he seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.
Especially because this fast-organised vote puts the Egyptian people before the ultimatum: "Whether you approve my text or I leave unlimited authority," which otherwise should end after the new constitution has been approved.
And in this special air yesterday 85 Members of the said constitutional assembly with a large majority of Islamists approved the text.
Most liberals failed to vote.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitution was declared, they knocked at the door by not having an opportunity to express their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society or members of religious minorities have made their move.
In order to achieve a capacity for reconciliation, 11 of the replacements were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim brotherhood.
No wonder, then, that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
The commentators further argued that one of the many disputes that day was about... hours for prayer, when some members of the committee held the view that the hours in the sitting room were not properly managed.
The text that was voted on last night is made up of 234 articles.
The subject matter of general attention, Article 2, remains in line with the 1971 version of the Constitution and provides that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the essential requirements, hope that it replaces the term "principles" with the term "rules", which would make it possible to apply more stringently.
For the Islamics, the fact that this article has not been corrected is a sign of their good will and respect for other parts of the Egyptian society.
"Traffickness," they say to liberals who see only a verbal problem in it.
According to them, Islamization of the Constitution is carried out through other articles.
They shall focus in particular on Article 220, which confers on the University of Al-Azhar a consultative role, in particular on questions of verification of compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt's expert Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "persons who are invited to express themselves are not elected and do not have any democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of theocracy."
The concerns of the Liberals are even more exhilarating the fact that the future Rector of the University should be less moderated than the current one.
"For the time being, there was no specific religious consequence.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a civil state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not inflamed, but university workers, a number of them have studied in French schools," Alexis Blouet, who prepares work on constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, it agrees that "there may be disagreements as to the interpretation of Article 220, because the terms used therein are part of the religious vocabulary.
There is a particular reference here to "fiqh" [Islamic law science, known as Reg.].
And in the future, there may be a question of the extent to which civil judges are competent to comment on this."
Yesterday, the text approved is highly criticised in addition to the religious pages because of the extended powers granted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brotherhood insists that there was a significant restriction against the former regime.
Another controversial place: the authority of the armed forces.
In accordance with the wishes of the military representatives, the implementation of the defence budget will not be carried out by Parliament, but by the National Defence Council.
They will not be prohibited in military courts from dealing with civilians as required by the Association for the Protection of Human Rights.
These associations speak of their doubts in relation to the text which they consider to be anti-freedom.
The criminal offence is maintained and the offense is still prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for printing.
In addition, no article deals with the protection of women, highlights Heb Morayef from the Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only point of view is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had a TV show last night, events are scheduled for this afternoon.
Then the state's leaders will manifest on Saturday.
In Israel, the Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the world's beak and the sea from a saturated solution of salt
The country that has been promised combines the size of Bible truths, modern comfort, and insecurity of nature.
The company AaF identified five of the most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Give With Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that God’s mercy will be upon all who enter into this “wicked one. ”
And Galilee - the place of Jesus' miracles: changing the water into wine at the wedding, walking after the water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples and after his resurrection.
But most of the holy places are in Jerusalem.
The believers will pass through the Way of Pain or the Way of Jesus Christ (Latin Via Dolorosa).
Starting at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the trial took place, he walks through the streets of the Old City and leads to the Temple of God on Mount Golgotha - to the place of the cross, to the stone of the anointed and the place where Jesus was buried.
There is a symbolic Christian dove of the world that symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built in a place where, according to the Christian legend, a tree from which they produced a cross for Jesus ’ cross was built.
There is also the most sacred place in Jerusalem for the Jews - the wall of the ruins of the temple, which was destroyed by Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, there are people of different denominations leaving notes with wishes that will then be fulfilled.
Entrepreneur the path vertically
The fact of Masada’s fortress remained hidden from the enemy that Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
The cliff is located on the cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who deal with horocescism can get their own powers.
The others on this historic mountain will take out the chain.
And in the north of the country there is a well-known Hermon ski resort, located at 1600-2040 m above sea level, which enjoys a huge tourist resort in the winter months.
To this ski paradise, tourists travel from the hill of the coastal bus.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legends, they were apparently living on the top of the mountain of worship of the gods.
Visit the unique museum
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You won't be able to visit all of them during one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, which is located near Knesset (parliamentum).
It contains ancient Qumran manuscripts or Dead Sea scrolls found in the caves of the Jewish wilderness, and further about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Arts is also worth a visit to Tel-Aviv.
In his exhibition, his wages are widely represented impressive and expressive Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon, you can visit the Al Basha museum, which presents visitors with several rooms of ancient Turkish spas with the figures of spa users and spa caregivers from that time.
In Caesarea there is a unique private museum Ralli, where you can admire the soybeans of Dalí and Roden.
There's no guide here, no paratroopers.
Access is free and gifts are strictly refused.
Five Museums - The Museum of the Foto or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - will tell about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - Children's Memory - was built on the memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
Enter inside - and you will feel in absolute darkness.
The stars are shaking.
The names of the Jews' children and the names of the countries in which they were killed shall be changed.
Ukraine is also being introduced.
Improve Your Health
The three main spa centers of Israel are located on the Mediterranean coast, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, aquaparks, dolphins to the ocean.
Interestingly, the Red Sea can also be bought in the winter months, because the water temperature in it does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and it has people bathing all year round.
The Dead Sea is, by the way, the most unique sea in the world, located at the lowest anchor point of the planet - at a level of 417 m below sea level.
Azur water is a saturated salt solution, which is easily maintained by people who are not allowed to swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealisticly beautiful.
Get out here to be treated with salt water - salty, and with a medical bath that can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergy, asthma, eczema, arthritis, inflammation of the fluid, diabetes, to cure the affected nerves.
Touch the Hidden Past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
They were accompanied by famous sea routes that linked Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The references to this city are in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is the place where Noah built his ark and preserved the beautiful Andromeda, with which they lived together a long and happy life.
In fact, tourists love tolls on the narrow streets named after the signs of the zoo.
It's said that if you press on the walls in the street of "your" sign, your luck will be positive.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to be photographed.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theater and "get" the strength of the crusades.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the home of Roman prosecutors, including Pilate Pontus.
The carefully reconstructed theatre is used today for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, by word of mouth
If you're going to Israel, you don't have to worry about your incomplete English: in this country, about 30% of the Russian population speaks.
On the road it is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for cheques (now 1 dollar is about 3.8 shekels).
The city transport is especially bus, but in Jerusalem it is driving a speed tram and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country with six stations connecting the lower city to the upper.
It's basically a underground wireway.
Traveling by all types of city public transport is worth 6 shekels, for which you can drive 1.5 hours by moving.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath was celebrated.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, it stops working on markets, shops and public transport.
And Sunday morning starts a week of work.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels you will only get a basket of food: with the exception of pork, seafood, fish without mushrooms and food containing a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a wide selection of lamb and beef meat, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish cheese hummus, the most varied kinds of sauces, cakes from the milk of the cheese - falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no fat dogs on the streets of the cities of Israel.
That's why there's a lot of hungry cats here who are gracefully "toying according to their taste."
In the evening hours you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Passing cats love sloppy places and taste their way into every goodness.
The car loan will be from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 per day (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And to borrow a bike will be about 15 shekels a day.
The entrances to the museum are 30 shekels on average.
Indicated numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
To know the country and to rest came the largest citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The country's promised visit from January to October 2012 to 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the expiry of the visa on 9 February 2011.
"Great and powerful" announces it to Moscow: Emigrants will save their money in the language
While MPs and human rights defenders are still debating the law on compulsory language tests, there have already been frauds in the country who sell "failed" certificates
Moscow, Petrohrad and other Russian cities come to 13 million foreign workers every year.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, the law entered into force, according to which every migrant worker must make a test of the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing and municipal economy, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, FMS promises that the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors over time.
However, tests will be based not only on language knowledge but also on Russian history and the fundamentals of law.
Language knowledge will also need to be confirmed to obtain and extend the work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law is not subject to any person who has successfully succeeded in obtaining a certificate and obtaining an academic degree to the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
The use, judgment and protection of rights
The network of test sites will work under the protection of the Russian Language Institute, the University of Friendship among Nations, the State University of Moscow, the State University of St. Petrohradá and other Russian high schools.
Migrants can run tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing has also been supported by representatives of the State pride and FMS (Federal Migration Services).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders have been able to put a lot of questions in the press: and what will it actually bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for Russia and for visitors?
First of all, the representatives of the migration service are responsible for reducing the number of people who suffer from "on-the-job" work.
Many people today talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains the chairman of the FMS Russian Presidency in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
Their rights should be protected before they leave.
Only an organised recruitment system will solve the problems of foreign workers by 90%.
Problems arise in immigrants without a call, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language - says Sebelev - the future migrant is sentenced to shoots with dishonest people, who will provide him with the help of a "instruction" to dangerous, close residents in which he and dozens of others, like himself, will spend months without food and documents and run for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrant workers.
"In their governments they promise one thing, but after arrival they are deceived, they have fun of their passports, they do not pay the promised wages," confirms the Head of the Tajik Labour Migration Board, MS Tolib Sharipov.
Don't you dare!
The less many citizens of the Central Asian Republic who intend to move to Russia, they acknowledge that they do not only know the language of the country they want to get, but do not even have experience with the work they do.
Of course, it is not their fault, as much as the accident: only very few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tadzik can afford at least adequate basic education.
For their families also need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need to be properly dressed, dressed, and equipped for school.
As children grow up to productive age, they first have to get paid for their work.
Without language knowledge, it's hard to admit.
"You feel humiliation and low self-esteem."
It is true that in view of the law on language tests, human rights defenders point to one important issue.
Testing will only be carried out in those migrants who have legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't test it or get any more official work.
In the meantime, most migrant workers live as well as previously in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or unauthorized entry"
Many of the incoming workers claim that getting official status in our country is not easy at all.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and all those language difficulties.
Legalization is also worth money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Russian police officers know that we basically have false documents, without registration, and with that gas leaking cases.
"They demand a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," he shared with the reporters about his experience with the citizens of Tajikistan, Umed Chuškadamov.
"Come on, don't be hungry, get a painting"
On the first day of validity of the language law, it was found that false documents were not only the documents of migrants on registration.
FMS employees have already had a number of false certificates on language exams.
The above-mentioned documents are printed on the ordinary colour printer.
Of course, new owners did not get free: each of the migrants was hoping that it would be so easy to solve the tests, he paid seven thousand rubles for this document.
That's two and a half times higher than the formal test graduation: it's going to become a migrant worker of three thousand rubles.
The main task of the immediate future is to ensure a system against corruption so that workers can not simply buy documents, with government officials and human rights defenders agree.
Government authorities may so far promise foreign workers who have failed the tests for the first time, the time required to complete the course of the basics of the Russian language.
Visitors who do not have Russians are expected to work in areas where active contact with people is not required.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not run an illegal arms market
The proportion of criminal offences involving the use of legally held weapons is very low
MVD Russia submits a proposal to strengthen the law in relation to the owners of civil weapons.
This is the reaction of government authorities to recent events: there was an incentive to shoot cases at the weddings that were hung without a victim, and a massacre prepared by Moscow's lawyer Dimitri Vinograd, who killed seven people as a result.
Police want to ban the wearing of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which you can obtain a license to carry weapons - from 18 to 21 years old.
This opinion supports the Committee's head of pride for security and the fight against Irina Jarovaj's corruption, which promised that amendments to the Arms Act would be submitted to the State pride in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem of the path of "sprouting screws".
An open letter appeared on the network, whose authors - representatives of various social shooting organisations - demand that the law be rejected "unreasonably reinforced".
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, Vasilij Lesnikov, a lawyer and a criminal in the discussion with the Russian editor of the BBC.
According to the Ministry of the Interior statistics, 142 crimes were committed during the six months of 2012 by the use of firearms by the registered authorities of the Ministry of the Interior, while 1168 thousand crimes were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the strengthening of the legislation in the field of civil weapons does not accept the offender to move to the "black" market.
According to their words, any weapon in Moscow can currently be found at a low price.
At present, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from competitions by officers
The "Black" arms market is stocked with several channels.
The main channels are five, says Colonel Victor Baranéc, who worked for ten years at the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot pages receiving arms orders
The first of them is the "military or military journey", which means a weapon that was cut off during the battles in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were also stolen by the Russian officials and the convicts themselves," Baranec says.
Other types of "black weapons" are weapons stolen criminals from security forces.
Baranec explains that there are also thefts from police funds and weapons stolen directly from employees of criminal authorities.
Illicit "mainly" is available for sale from military funds.
In many military funds, explosions often occur.
"It has been proven that some fires have been deliberately founded - to cover up the lack," said the former soldier.
According to the words of Barance and the arms manufacturers, they make their contribution.
"At present, private arms companies that are not competitive on the international market are emerging and are cutting off weapons that are supplying to the black market, including Moscow," said the expert.
Another source of the black market is feeding.
In particular, a large number of guns and machines come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There's their production, sometimes weapons are produced here in painting, and there's a mafia that organized their gas production," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun from?
Experts calculated the approximate share of individual sources of supply of illegal weapons on the "black" market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for the Analysis of Problems and the Design of Public Administration.
Specialists have broken down the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office's records, the literature of crime and the data from public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The overwhelming majority of illegal weapons, the investigators, come from military and executive authorities.
Half of all weapons were found on the black market "in the wine of official agents whose work is linked to weapons," the report says.
According to the data available to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from armed conflicts, 14% of the cases occurred in the theft of weapons during their production, 5% being "black archaeology".
A salesperson-consultant of one of the arms trades, who has asked us not to mention his name, is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations of black "archaeology" have not been bought before - they're just too old.
Most often, as they say, salesmen drive for new shipments directly into military stocks.
Through the solicitor, the interested person buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
You order a gun with him and he sells it to you across the board.
"He will take her to the city and sell her there for 900 euros per piece with two containers," he says.
"The truth is that the police are good in the image, and therefore whenever they start to burn a plan in the explanation of criminal acts, they will carry out a check-up with illegal arms dealers," the counsel says.
"Like in a luxury store."
The sellers with the buyer most often find each other through their acquaintances.
I visited websites and blogs until a guy showed up who offered me the chance to go to the "Example" platform where there will be a man who would lead me to the "cat" where we will act together.
The price was mostly found out by the time I was there.
Military reporter Viktor Baranjec
If I want to get a gun, I need a known person who knows the way out, tell the salesman - a counselor.- I have such a known one, but I don't fully trust him.
The sellers on the market are, but there's also to go, hypothetically "from Mr Ivan Ivanovice, who asked me to arrange for a daughter to fall out of her teeth."
And now I'm going to get over the man I'm sure of.
He also gives it only to me because he knows I won't give it to him.
Beginners are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baranéc tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid - 1990 ’ s, when he was working on a facility for publication on this topic.
The schematics did not change according to his words.
They gave him a photo album where there was "everything you ever thought about."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," the soldier recalls.
To the buyer, according to Baranèce, they don't offer pickles in the bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, just don't buy - we're going with the salesman in the woods and we're going to set up the market.
"They give me the chance to shoot, and when I'm convinced that the gun is shooting well, we're starting to act," she says.
Intruder on the couch
Searchers will bring you to the "Vkontaktu" website and groups where you are offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
There is no need for documents or personal meetings.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the advertising title on the website "Buy a gun or a machine."
On these pages, users leave their notification and ask questions.
And sell the unfavourable?
"Of course without a license," asked the user "Ivan" (record is retained).
"I'm buying TT.Moscow" - it's briefly formulating the "Fedorenkov" requirement.
The Federal Security Service recently has decided on a huge network of targeted websites and people who want to buy military weapons can bury them with a shovel.
People gather like hungry fish for bait and then get carbon on Siberia.
Military rapporteur and senior military leader Viktor Baranéc
I have heard about such schemes: websites are usually registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer shall make the payment via the ATM.
"In response to this, the salesman will send a photo and a description of the instructions where the weapon is hidden," Dmitrij Kislov, a press spokesman, reports the NGO "Right to Arms".
Viktor Baranec confirms that after placing an order on the websites you can stay unarmed and sit behind the nets.
The Federal Security Service recently has decided on a huge network of targeted websites and people who want to buy military weapons can bury them with a shovel.
"People gather like hungry fish for bait and then get coal on Siberia," he confirms.
Macarov for $100
When you buy illegal firearms, you will usually pay the amount from $100 to $900 according to expert estimates.
According to Dmitry Kislov from the NGO "Right to Arms", you will arrange the Makarov gun for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait a month to one and a half months.
The weapon shall be dispatched from the stockpiles for long-term storage through the medium-term stockpiles.
According to the official statistical office, the number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7% in October 2011 compared with the period of January 2011 and was 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of reported cases of theft and extermination of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, staff from fast food and supermarkets are attending
Work on a dedicated "McDonald" goes through to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days in America, there has been a wave of protests against low wages in the high-markets of Walmart and in restaurants of popular fast-growing chains, such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Vendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into a nine wave, or whether it will be judged soon.
All these actions are supported by committees and a number of left-wing social organisations.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages received by a number of employees in Walmart and in fast-growing systems, the aim of the protest organizers is to achieve their creation in their committee organisations.
At present, this economic sector is practically unaffected by the expertise.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called "Black Friday", when a cheap sale orgy hit America, captured millions of residents, and in some cases was accompanied by fighters.
On this day, some Walmart employees, in which 2.2 million people worldwide are working, have left their workplace and demonstrated together with the committees and left-wing activists of international trade chains companies, whose goods are destined for lower and middle-class people.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from prey through hunting rifles and car batteries to dryers, eggs and milk.
Products in its sales are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many employees with low wages in Walmart's stores buy only themselves at work.
Availability and range of goods made from the Walmart chain one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart may allow itself to sell goods so cheaply because it only pays little of its employees.
They also complain about bad working conditions, such as lack of automatic vehicles or hand scanners.
The "Black Friday" demonstrators demanded an increase in salaries and complained that the health insurance costs provided by the companies increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart worker gets $9.5 an hour, but it doesn't correspond to the expenditure, the employees say.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average wage to $12 per hour, it will be $3.2 billion a year.
It is on average 1.1% more than this company is paying now.
If Walmart moves an increase in the wages fully to the consumer's shoulder, each visit to the sale will be only 46 cents more.
In a year like this, customers lose about $12,39 more than they do today.
Walmart’s supporters point out that the protest was carried out in only nine countries and that the company should not cause virtually any harm.
"Black Friday" in company sales lasted from 8 hours on Thursday to midnight the following day, and during this period Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, her deposits were made on "Black Friday" of nearly 100 million transactions.
The representative of Dan Fogelman stated in the interview for the left-wing Huffington Post website that the jobs had left "less than five" employees of Walmart, and that the protest was all "more media sensation" organized by the committees.
"Unbounded treasure!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart's commercial houses (the ones in this advanced city are not too in shape, and therefore they are not nearly here), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of dollars and then doesn't pay you sick and doesn't pay you well for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, City Council member in New York
At present, the minimum wage is paid for work in accordance with federal laws and the New York State regulations of $7.25 per hour.
Fastfood restaurants gradually increase this rent, but only slightly, and on average, they receive their number of workers in New York at $8.90 an hour.
There's no lower wages in this precious city.
I don't quite understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
The "McDonald" employs nearly a quarter of American teenagers who work behind the school desk for part-time and live with their parents.
Only a few people are watching their main source of livelihood or planning to stay there for a long time.
At the moment, I keep meeting with McDonald's employees, who complain that they have to live with these money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum hangs a comment, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children unless you know how to feed them.
Participants of the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at "McDonald" on 40th Street and at Madison Avenue, demanded that treasurers and chefs start to receive at least 15 dollars per hour, which is more than double their current minimum wage.
They also called for the establishment of a committee organisation in the area of rapid nutrition.
American laws prohibit the administration from prohibiting the establishment of trade union organisations and from punishing trade union activists by harassment and release.
On the other hand, management rarely makes life easier for them.
However, it is difficult to establish in the fast-cleaning industries of the Committee's organisation for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high fluctuation of employees.
Incompatibility
This day there were loud protests also in a number of other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The event was held at the "McDonald" Sunday meeting near Times Square, where a number of local democratic policies took place, especially a member of the Jumaane Williams City Council, who said, "McDonald" says he sells billions of portions, and then doesn't pay you sick and does not pay you properly for your honest work!"
The demonstrators also welcomed the support of other prominent New York democracies, such as the mayor of Bill de Blasio, who said that "we need to work together to support fast food workers in order to achieve fair rewards for their work and economic prosperity, which every non-virgin deserves!"
As described in the New York Times, it was the biggest action of its kind in the history of the American sphere of rapid fertilization.
But only a few hundred people took part in it, although not all of them were employees of the fast-growing, tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event becomes a spark that burns the flame of mass movement is still unclear.
"I'm gonna make a brain bet on average"
Among fans of modern technology virtual reality is the popular theme of expanded reality; it means that the world is being occupied, especially through the borders of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer of its annual conference, Google introduced a working model of this news and in November it was announced that Microsoft also applied for a patent.
The interview with the leading group of interactive 3D technologies in the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft Sharam Izadim shows that for scientists of this company, glasses are already in the past.
The perspective is to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands, to create virtual public screens.
- Please tell us in the frame, what's your research group doing?
We're dealing with human interactions with machines, but at the same time, we're trying to move the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, mankind has hung in the stage of work with pixels on the flat screen, at least sometimes touching the screen finger.
We want to look at 5-10 years in advance and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect recorders - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox is for sale without Kinect recorders today, because for everyone it is very interesting to manage using gestures.
- What else is waiting for us in the future?
- Despite that Kinect's system has transferred the interaction to the physical level, a lot of the interaction is still going on on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system accepts more data), but the output flow has not yet been particularly.
We're trying to change it, we're actually working on three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projectives.
We need to get the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to know not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much better form.
And first of all - to hell with those stupid helmets virtual reality!
- What do you think of voice control?
That's a popular thing, but isn't it overestimating?
- Of course he can't be considered an exaggeration - a private question arises, because we don't always want to inform others in our area about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about various, just such short, expensive devices.
At the same time, the guest would not see the camera of the device, but the bracelet that would watch the movements of bones and muscles.
He's already big, but theoretically he can be reduced to the size of a bracelet watch.
However, it is generally true that the future has a mixed type of control, such as the gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how do you ask me to give you this lemonade?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, that's gonna be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to take the user to adjust to what the machine can or cannot do at the moment?
- It's not necessary at all, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future, we will have to work first and foremost on developing new types of recorders that can more accurately detect human reactions.
For example, laser sensors that provide relatively good deep resolution can be very important.
- Do you have to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough divorce, depth, or anything else today?
- Basically, today's generation - that's what we can reflect on in our work on a three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just about the megapixels itself, it's like the math and the depth.
At the current point of view, all current technologies are insufficient for us - this contributes to the work of algorithm designers.
So we need to remember not only the resolution in X and Y, but also Z.
So it's also very important to speed, number of images per second.
The human movement is relatively dynamic and current data flows of 30 images per second are frankly little, especially for guests.
Stephen Betishes from our laboratory in Redmond made the touch sensor with a adjustable delay of processing in length 1 to 100 ms, while the current serially produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how this affects a person's interaction with machines.
For me at work, there would be a very useful equivalent of such a device, but I don't need that much touch, but I need some pictures in a second.
- And there's no need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect system now uses three "camera", one of which is actually the infrared transmitter and the other - the receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera, it's actually a normal visual tape recorder.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or make it worse because it would increase the necessary volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible kinect analogue system, play with curved camera position and see how it will help to determine a three-dimensional position.
- If I remember well, Microsoft (as opposed to Google) didn't present his glasses in public.
You don't think that with regard to the daily use of technology extended reality using special glasses, it's one of the most powerful platforms?
- Of course to walk and still hold the jamtphone in your raised hand is not very comfortable, but I think: the most powerful option would be a "favourable" image of the expansion of reality when it would be possible to switch on the platform of the clouds at any time from the glasses to the smartphone, projection display and further around.
Bryl - it's a very personal device, it's their strength (only you see things), and at the same time weakness - extended reality based on the bryl will not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that manipulation with virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also to the ordinary mortal.
There is one problem that criticism often points to: there is no response!
Hands don't feel anything!
How does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that the extended reality - it's the seventh thing that goes through itself in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the addition of mass volumes could easily become an eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - the use of the second hand as a certain type of background for the display.
It's an excellent way to record pressure!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding massivity to these "images in the air" - for example, interference of some directional ultrasonic peppers at the defined point, where the finger is located, triggers a sense of mass, but it is still very weak - as if you were shooting at the tip of your fingers.
There is also a bracelet on the wrist that affects the nerve marriage in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool your brain?
To think he's feeling what he's supposed to feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here is another challenge that will be fought for a long time - how to accept a person who is physically in a very tight space to believe that he is walking with an open, practically infinite space - we also work on the concept of running tracks (not like clubs), moving platforms and also huge balls.
If the brain's bent, it's still work for many years.
That's what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - a lot of things are at the very beginning.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "Petrohradská avantgarda", dedicated to the citizens who are in charge, are an avantgarde of culture and art.
At the top of the list, there have already been important figures of Petrohrad’s art scene, whose profits exceed the city’s framework, often find recognition in Europe without reaching the full height.
The new hero "Rosbalt" is the amazing artist Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller - a married man, who is all dressed in red, which you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here in fashion halls and on the paints.
The images of Cyril Miller, wherever they are exposed, always attract the gifts of the spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical petro-radic manufacturers, the creators of new mythology.
Cyril Miller - this is an imaginary man of a petrohad avant-garde at the end of 80 and early 90s.
In addition to being a city man, his voice in the streets causes a smile on the faces of the citizens, it increases the mood.
He recently took the bottle into his hand and became a petro-radic bottler, because he had grown up to this complex role in his entire divine life, philosophy, and image.
- Cyril, why are you going all over the city in red and not in yellow or, for example, in Turkish?
- I chose a red color as a designer with a visual and image.
In this world, the red color is a compromise between artist, imagemaker and the public.
Although it is generally true that everything that is a little different from gray is aggressive and promotes bad qualities.
But my provocations are focused on making a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is, above all, an invitation to discussion.
And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition at the House of Culture in Nevska, where my work was shown.
I understand what my way is.
At that time, I was unable to understand the wave of the old unofficial artists and the new, free types of artists.
I was friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gasonics who brought us to Puškinský 10 and the other waves were not.
I like the theatre, the clothes, the music, all the genres except for the words.
- And it all happened in your art clinic... - It was important for me to feel at the center of the culture of Petérburk, where all the best forces of creation should be gathered.
In 1995 I held a place on Puškinské 10, and there was still a music-artificial club, a Bohemian club, a peterburk Bohema home before the reconstruction.
There were many born there: NOM, Tequila Jazz, remember how Schnura brought in with the project "Ucho Van Gogha".
Schnur and his friends sang under a gleam of light song, dressed in prolific suits, among them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg has led many programs of the Hali-Galivian times.
We gave them Trachtínberg, thus starting his great career, basic education and training he got from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Griboidov - that's the call Art Clinic.
This is where our workers left and our guests are staying.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture meant something else.
In 2000 the research was organized in the press, the special price was "People in Our City".
In the nomination "The Artist of the Year" I was appointed, thus ending my peak.
In the new times, according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In today's years it's easy to be popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are characteristic in a recognizable way.
- Many of my images - these are the hits in which there is a live catch of currentity and insight.
I'm going to have a program show "Russian Museum in Clunes".
Clowns are an overtime category.
I used to be social, being like that is painful and scary today.
But in clowns, it's all a mess, it's a tragedy.
I love grotesque, my grotesque ideas.
For example, save the world by means of a total rediscovery in the order of order.
Today, people meet according to their clothes, focusing on external mechanics, not on the inner person.
Or maybe he can't put his hand in his face and he needs to swim in his face.
And the blame will be removed by the overcoating.
- We recently saw you as a city bottler. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should it be if I didn't?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- At present, commercial, useful art should be thorough, tactile, sweet.
There's a breakdown in culture.
People used to meet in noises, God loved one, just other people.
It's all broken up today on a micro-society, it's very hard today to love everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar banker to like everyone.
Today we need to think about who you like.
Today, every cultural hero has 100 fans.
And there's a few thousand spectators coming to St. Michael's!
- Fans come to him, there's a sexual social sphere.
And 300 people and 10,000 will not come to the cultural land, and the result is less management, money, everything is sacred.
I've got fans, the main thing is that no one's gonna let them down and fail what they're used to.
When I was young, I painted images of someone who hung on a wall with Falke and Larionov.
I started with images that most people end up with.
Let's get people to know each other a lot today.
They say:Culture of spiritual, culture of consumption.
There's no culture of consumerism, it's a waste.
I am a man of culture yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, who refused money for drawing images.
And I'm for that kind of culture.
- Cyril, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a concept: an actor through culture.
Not every one of them can deal with culture.
At the time of the proper emperors, it was not so in all, the emperors may not have understood much of the culture, but they understood that it was necessary to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people in Petrograd who might be experts, but they're stuck somewhere in the corner, because they need a lot of experts who really appreciate these experts and they'll put them on the right path.
It's a taste that thrives today.
Tataz Erarta, but it's different from saying that we don't accept all modern art, there are artists who should be looking for another museum.
- What do you think of Peterburk?
- Petěrburk - it's not the main city of culture, there's much more culture in Moscow, there's the right land.
And on our east, art is being done poorly.
We need cultural land, but we have more writers today than readers, that's bad.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious, who like to go to shows, concerts.
We're just weak on this layer.
We need art to become fashionable, as it was in the early century.
The project is implemented through St.Peterburk grant
Draw Spaces
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Cosmic cobra caravans with land on board are released on their way, looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, the main question arises: How can you keep your family safe or on a given replacement planet?
I don't think the choice is big.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be won, even if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," says a highly established scientist at the State Astronomical Institute P. K. Sternberg (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
While there are better conditions for life on Mars, on the surface of Venus temperatures reach 500 degrees Celsius.
It's only possible to live there at high altitude or orbit Venus... in space.
To answer the questions of reproduction in the universe, scientists began with the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were made on plants.
Four generations of games grown on the round track are nothing different from their earthly relatives.
Then it was performed to remove the tissue to the orbit - very small fruity men of Drosophila.
In 1979 it was sent to the universe to verify how the embryo develops in a state of no difficulty.
We're getting a perfectly normal bird at the exit.
But then problems begin.
"There is a problem that this bird must find resistance, build on its own feet and start moving," says the leading laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN Vladimir Sychev.
If they don't find any resistance, the birds are chaotic and they're doing coercion.
After 10 hours, freshly fried birds came to a complete failure of instincts.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was they just died in four days.
" Twice we let the birds fly, but then we refused because it's just impossible to work with them," comments the failure of the chicken experiment in Vladimir Sychev universe.
The last miniarcha was on the round track 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, experiments will continue.
In the biosatellite "Bion" but they'll only be the beings of one sex.
There was an experiment with rats that were already pregnant.
They basically didn't reveal anything supernatural.
"It was only in biosatellites, but again - it is a unique experiment and such attempts must be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on the earth, a seed was born to the cosmic rats.
However, it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in the universe.
It's a difficult task.
Animals simply cannot realize their sexual instincts when they lose their normal environment.
A man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens governs abstract thinking and is able to create the right emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger threatens the Tereskovs.
The most precious thing humanity has is a woman's body.
Our Tchaka flew away, and no one on Earth could tell if they'd take a flight to space.
If he can give birth after that year.
"Because no one has answered this question yet," says the Veteran rocket-space industry of the Vatican.
In June 1964, more than a year after the flight to space, Valentina Těreškov's first wife-cosmonaut was born.
The father of the child was also the cosmonaut of Andrian Nikolai.
In 1988, the son of the second female cosmonaut of Svetlanje Savicke was born, who visited the orbit twice and who also worked in the open space.
However, the risk remains.
We only have a few cosmonauts that have been born after years and a growing health of the offspring.
"In addition, it can be dangerous even in orbital years," says cosmonaut-pilot, Hrdine of the Soviet Union and Hrdine Ruska Valerij Poljakov.
However, mankind must inevitably look for new paths in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK Hydrolaborator is a mandatory stage of preparation for the flight.
Here, under the conditions of zero attraction, cosmonauts acquire the habits needed to work in the open space.
The water imitates the state of undiminishedness.
Although for adults, water is comfortable, but in its strange way, for young children it is natural life.
Little yachters seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a relationship between having a child on average 9 months in the mother’s fertility water and then being more comfortable on the water.
In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first burial, it will only last 2 weeks.
"It's very little for a child to forget something," says the swim instructor Marina Aksenov.
In fact, if for a newborn baby the state of the natural state without difficulty is more natural, then for women the natural inexhaustible gravity is attractive force.
In the state of undiminishedness, the body’s ability to fertilize is reduced very quickly for the brittle muscles, the muscles of the pancreas.
We can keep that off if the muscle stimulators function when they are born.
After all, it is possible for the fetus to take place in a special chamber in which the mother’s body will fertilize the fruit.
"And what else?" asks Valerij Poljakov the complex questions.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If the organism is not attracted to the ground, it cannot properly form the body or the muscle system.
New births on the circuit are not possible as adults in a special suit with a load in which he could train.
He's just gonna get rid of what he needs for his development.
"If we go with you into an experiment that allows the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring a healthly disabled person to Earth, who will be totally unappropriate to the present environment," the Head of the IBMP RAN Igor Pestov Bioethics Commission predicts.
So the birth of children in the universe today is just a theoretical question.
However, the time will come when the earth will become a reality and when the earth will be released into its crusts on a distant planet that will become the home of their offspring born in the universe.
Head of NKU: Control of the fraud system has failed to blame the politicians
In relation to public procurement, the Czech Republic has good controllers and quality legislation, but obeys its application.
In the interview for Aktuálno.cz, the vice president of Miloslav Kal's Supreme Control Office says that.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that is what we think is missing," comments Kala's current situation.
Similar conclusions also indicate joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example, the wrong practice indicates Peter’s approach to the so-called “swift system”.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not burden the entrepreneur with his controls - is it prohibited or allowed?
"The law must be somewhat set up, and if it prohibits something, then neither the president of the government can prevent it from doing the work of the office that is obliged to go to control and enforce the duties," Kala says.
At a meeting of the Audit Committee in the Embassy, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, under which legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly was that about?
It's a parallel check we started about two years ago.
It is simply said that European legislation regulates the way in which public procurement is dealt with, followed by individual national legislation and then by practice itself.
We have put all of this together, and even though the control is not yet over, we have seen very interesting differences - generally the legislation is perhaps even "more thorough and more perfect", but the practice itself is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to continue to create more precise rules, but it is necessary to commit to the same application of the law.
What can this project do for you?
It is precisely such joint control that could contribute to stop us from making efforts to simplify laws, reduce and improve limits, if this does not have such a positive impact.
Economy means getting the right thing for a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price to exclude enrichment and, where appropriate, criminal proceedings.
But by reducing the limit of orders, we don't have to make it.
Perhaps the system pays such a amount of "paper", that those who want to search for holes in the system will get rid of it much easier than if the limit remained higher.
You are talking about foreign problems with the transposition of public procurement legislation into practice.
How does the German control system work?
Is the office here similar to our NKU, or is it set up otherwise?
As for the offices, as the NKU works there, the Bundesrecnungshof, which is organised like us, also has a college, it is just a little different, but in principle both offices are acting similarly.
The powers are also similar to those of a certain degree, namely, that Germany has sparse arrangements, so that these accounting courts also have at the level of individual sparsely different countries, in which the system differs slightly from ours.
BRH can only control the cash pool, represented by state resources.
Public media, which are managed by countries and communities, are controlled from the level of public accounts.
What about the darker legislation, so that's easier than ours?
In general, I would hate to compare it without specific data, but in some respects Germany is marked as an example, but you can't be sure it's better at all.
So it's also the fact that they have better controllers?
No, of course not, but I say again, I don't like this comparison.
But it has to be said that even the countries that we consider to be a model are dealing with a whole range of problems.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be any good for them to cooperate with our office, would it?
What about foreign legislation, which meant new public procurement laws for your office, is its impact?
Since the period of validity of this novel is relatively short, we still do not appear in control actions.
Because we're doing ex post checks, we need to count with a certain delay.
We are observing this until now only in the process of preparing future controls - we have started our new "risk detection tool of inefficiency", through which we have found nearly 14 thousand public orders, and we have analysed them - these changes will obviously occur there, because the limits, the conditions of some types of selection procedure change and so on.
So do you consider the adoption of this law to be more beneficial, or any other burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that can arise here is that the rules are "screwing" and will not be possible to follow them.
For the purposes of the previous rules, controlled persons are already bound by the supplier (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) to the fact that any non-compliance with the public procurement law means a breach of the budget.
So does the law have the price to simplify in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, and not punish those who allow a formal doubt that does not affect decision-making.
Such a system will only create greater pressure on bureaucracy.
So how do you get out of this?
Let's show ourselves where the road doesn't lead.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not bother the business to control the so-called "swift system" - and what does that mean?
Is the dirty system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be somewhat set up, and if it prohibits something, it cannot prevent the president of the government from carrying out the work of the authority which is obliged to monitor and enforce the duties.
He can say, "Let's change the law and let it go," but he can't say we're gonna do it like nothing.
In the public procurement law, there are relatively strict rules as to what should be formally implemented - which is right to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the person with the best offer is excluded only for formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right application - that's what I think we miss.
Roads are places of rust, most of which are mobile
In several places in the Czech Republic, roads are smooth and also snowy.
Mostly, though, cars are mobile, somewhere with increased caution.
Country of Karlovar
In the region of Karlovar this morning, the roads were mobile, but well-furnished and also snowcapped.
The temperature decreased between five and ten degrees below zero, but should be slightly heated during the day.
The snow has risen in the region, and in the lower plains there is only a weak layer.
However, on the hills of the Crusades is about 30 centimeters [30 cm] of snow.
The sites were also less visible due to the noise, resulting from the data of the dispatch of the country's road drivers.
The R6 motorways and first class communication are now accessible in the region without restriction.
However, caution is in place, for example, in some overcrowded areas where the surface can be smooth and smooth.
Passengers are also all roads of the second and third classes including mountain roads.
But in some senses, there is still the leftovers of the frozen and the place of the caught snow.
Above all, higher positions need to pay more attention to the driving.
Pardubic and King's Land
On some roads in the eastern Czech Republic, there is a threat of freezing, in higher places and in the mountains there may be a catchy layer of snow on the communications, it informs on its pages of the Directorate of Roads and Roads.
Motorists warn drivers from freezing, it can be created especially in the higher positions of the Pardubic region.
The sun can be around Lanškrona, Ústí nad Orlica, Poličky, Svitav or High Myth, especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
Chemicals are treated on roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitav.
The snow is especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and the Orlic Mountains.
The covered snow layer is at the highest level on the roads in the periods Richnov nad Kniežen and Trutnov.
In the eastern Czech Republic, it is most often clear today that there is no strike.
Temperatures usually move between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, a weak wind blows.
Plzeňýný
The roads in the Plzeň region are mobile this morning, but there is a need to adjust the weather with increased caution and driving.
It's cold after the wound, the temperatures move between three and nine degrees below the point of the ice.
After the previous snowing and the subsequent cooling, some communication may be infrequent.
The seats must also count with silence, but visibility will improve gradually.
It comes from the information of the country's highways.
The D5 distance is almost unlimited, but increased caution is recommended by communication managers between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most of the first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In southern Plzeńsk and Tachovska, there may be storks.
The second and third classes of communication are wet and in this case there is also a warning to the small sections.
Drivers should be careful mainly on less frequent routes in the area of Forests.
Olomouccan region
With the snowbag on the road they have to count the drivers heading today to the highest position in the Olomouk region.
After the chemical upheaval, she remained on the Red Mountain saddle and on the road towards the Videlský cross.
On the night of snow, the motorists in the field, on Schumpersk, according to road managers, were about three centimeters [3 cm] snowed.
In other parts of the country, the carriages are mostly transportable without restriction.
"Shumper is in the highest position of the rest of the snow.
With the snowbag on the Red Mountain saddle, the drivers must count towards Jeseník," CTK today said the driver of the Sumperian road management.
In the evening, their colleagues on Jesenick also went out, the roads to ae's highest places are now according to them after the chemical treatment of naked and wet.
In the Olomoucks there are roads that are free to travel, but in the Sternbers, drivers should be careful in the woods, where the carriages remained wet.
Austic region, Libereck region
Several difficult travel places report today after the morning of the roadblocks in northern Czech Republic.
In addition to several places with attacked snow or ice cream, the mountain road from Telnice na Knínice na Ústecka is also closed from the police database.
Temperatures are also kept below zero in lower positions, so ice and snow are likely to last on the roads.In the lowlands, especially in the south-east of the Czech Middle Ages, there are no problems and roads are just dry.
Transport complications have not yet been reported.
The appearance of glaciers is reported by road users, especially in the area of Szczeć.
According to meteorologists, the ideal conditions for it were in the night - over the rainy day and about snowing, in the night clear and cold.
From the main points, adverse conditions are reported also on road I/13 on the Oustic and Libereck region.
The tower of Telnica at the Knínica opened the twisted branches of trees, which, under the influence of the snow, turned to the driver.
Šimon Ornest: At concerts we want to gather positive energy
What do you think the end of the world will come in a month or so?
It's just one of the other scary news that people like to catch.
Together with the band The Tap Tap, we make fun of it more and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to distance or prevent it from the end of the world.
In addition, in December you will organize a completely united project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you imagine him closer to the readers?
It's a state-wide benefit action we've been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the May calendar announced on December 21st at 11:10 a.m.
On December 20th, from 21 hours, 3 concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostravo.
The end will be about the time when the May calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in Tichomore, which is in the time zone 12 hours before us.
Who came with this idea?
At first, it was probably my idea, and then we all figured it out together with our artist, Honzo August.
In addition to the fact that we want to gather enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about how we can once deliver this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we also created unique collections of items of shoes, shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world, which people can also support by buying at www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap Group, along with other interpreters, also sang a so-called Hymna against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World Canceled".
She's already very popular on YouTube today, and she's also going to sound at these beneficial concerts?
Of course, and that's in full conclusion, if we can do everything and the end of the world doesn't happen...
All the performers sing it at all three concerts simultaneously.
Hymnas are also intertwined in a unique direct broadcast on Czech television.
He wrote words to this song, and the main role of Jesus in the rock plays Tomáš Hanák, also singing Xindl X in it...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, given that we organize a lot of beneficial events and concerts...
We are actively trying to involve them in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested in and involved in working with us.
What's the race from the concerts against the end of the world for?
For the equipment of the Studeo Barrier Education Centre, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the National Association Tap in the Jedlik Institute.
For students of the Jedlik Institute, lecturers are regularly attending and engaged in activities that are fun and interesting.
The students themselves do not have the means to give themselves up as lecturers, so we try to enable them in this way.
Within the framework of the provision of the Jedlik Institute in the future, there will be a separate building to which we will move.
There will be several music groups and interpreters on every concert.
What did you pick them for?
We've been trying to set up a program that will address all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, China, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bartou, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiří Suchý will show.
For more information, please contact www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar "bombistic actions" to the future?
In May, we will first appear in the Prague Spring, so here we will certainly prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we'd also like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I would like to connect it with a talk in Washington and Chicago, personally, when we're in the United States.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist, for example, you have been in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group made up of handicrafted people.
How do you manage these routes logistically and organizationally?
It's not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five members on the electric vehicle, its vehicles have to travel in the luggage compartment, and of course we are running a lot of load and poor with tools...
However, until now it has always worked out without problems, the ČSA and British Airways have been very prepared for us to see how many times I have been amazed.
Even in Moscow, which we came back from recently, it was without any problems.
With exits abroad, you can compare how individual differences in bariency, public access to the disabled and similar.
What have you been seeing so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than we do, we witnessed in Russia that everything is still in full swings in the east.
On the contrary, Prague is a very barrier, here it is still unusual for a person on the electric vehicle to move himself in the center of the city.
They don't even pay the same kind of self-evidentity as if you'd prefer the riders in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are civil societys that are trying to alert people to problems with disabilities.
And what, on the other hand, do we still have to reach a more prosperous country?
There's a lot of things we're still behind...
It is important, however, to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it's quite common that even people with heavy handshake move on their own to the public, can go to the bathroom, to the museum, anywhere...
But it is not too common that a large number of people with disabilities would actively participate in social life, on the contrary, we are with The Tap Tap a little ahead!
Respect for the public or the barrier is one thing, but only when we have important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things start to change really.
So far, it's the only case of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap chapel is currently very popular, but let's go back in a few years what made you start it in 1998?
I acted as an educator in the Jedlik Institute, where I had a lot of young people around me who were interested in something.
And since I'm a musician myself, I'm playing saxophone, so I started an interesting music circle with my colleague.
Well, in time, as our moderator Ládja Angelovic says, we're a little out of hand (Laughter).
But the popularity has come up in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we started associating with well - known singers and also actively working on the promotion of the band.
It turns out that work that is not visible is basically as if it did not exist.
Moreover, thanks to the contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to attract it with The Tap Tap so high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something else.
Showbusiness is filled with things where one resembles the other.
It's logical in its own way, everything new is taken care of, and it takes a long time.
Things that are unique are very few, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us first is, of course, sorry, it's natural...
But this pity is absolutely unnecessary, because people with a handkerchief are not suffering from all the abandoned beings we have to regret.
They are people who can live a meaningful life and develop, of course, provided they have the means to do so.
I'm saying that if something happens to people with a handkerchief, it's not just moving for them, it's for the whole company.
Has this success also helped you to be a strict boss, how many people have labeled you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many things and require certain discipline.
But I think it's totally normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic performance and head in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to the test twice a week, go to the product and spend a lot of time on the concert trails, the enthusiasm is quick to leave.
But that's how it works everywhere in every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were at her beginnings in 1998?
Only one Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people leave and come, it can't be prevented.
Who wants and tastes, always opens the door to us
The day will come before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21 hours
In Prague Incheba arena, Brno Flédí and Ostravo Plynojem will take part in 12 chapels and other musicians from the Czech Republic
At the end of the evening, all three cities are combined with a telemost in a common song song of the chapel The Tap Tap "The End of the World Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to raise funding for the provision of the STUDEO multifunctional non-barrier education centre at the Prague Yedliksk Institute of 25 million CZK
Access to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 years of age have free admission to the Bohematicket pre-sale
Polish to cosmos.
Last week, Poland was adopted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency, as a second country from the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in a number of projects of the Agency over the next years.
Of course, the way to the cosmos began a long time ago.
For years the Polish were devoted to space before World War II, but they did not always meet with understanding.
For example, I would like to recall a lecture by A. Sternfeld in Warsaw's astronomical observatory, which presented ideas from his prosecuting work on the admission to cosmonautique on December 6, 1933.
The thoughts of a young engineer (1905) left the listeners cold and after years Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch in 1934 for the entrance to the cosmonautique in France.
The mentioned Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a major promoter of astronomy and cosmonautique.
In Polish journals he published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-famous propagandist of cosmonautique and his benefit was also appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the reverse side of the Moon was named by his name.
In 1925, a railway deck was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and is not aware of the details of the project.
It is not clear whether or not a rocket should be used for the derailment or for the acceleration of the derailment.
Information about this garden is known only from time print.
Since 1933, the Polish headquarters has been under attack by rockets.
Research has provided the Nuclear Technology Cell in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawe Wolfke and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckiegi.
Of the materials stored, it is evident that the research has grown to the stage of practical tests.
However, the arrival of the German army was interrupted.
In 1937, in the professional press, a project of photoelectric arable rockets, designed by Rohozyński and in the following year came out of the work of the Rocket - torpedo air and rocket bomb by author Leviwy-Krzywoblocký.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Timely Advisory Committee) was dedicated to all projects of military use of missile technology, which coordinated all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, the war ended.
Further work of the cosmonautics is found after the war in Polish press thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautique Society (Polish Association of Astronautiques).
First of all, the issue of the 1954 issue of Problem magazine contains four more comprehensive articles on astronauts.
In one of them, by Prof. M. Subotowice, it is proposed to create a company that will deal with the cosmonautique.
At that time, projects of artificial species were already under way and it was clear that space research was a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) has been trying to join the International Astronautic Federation (based in 1951) and has become a proper member of the PTA in the autumn.
And next year, PTA President Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became Vice President of the International Astronaut Federation.
This function continued until its death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has played a significant role in the development of highly successful meteorological missiles RM (Meteorological Rocket), which became the first Polish missile to be carried out by scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first started on October 10, 1958.
The 1,800-metre rocket was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of RM-1A was built and two-stage RM-2 rockets were launched in the Bledovian Desert in 1959.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
Another type of development should already have been capable of real scientific work - the RM-34 missile should have access to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the wind.
However, in 1962 another development was halted.
As a successor to the first RM-type rockets, Meteor-1 was developed in 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as two-step, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (named Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) have been developed, which vary the size of the space for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket, space with a volume of 0.4 litre, Meteor-1B with a volume of 0.34 litre and Meteor-1C with a volume of 0.62 litres was available.
Maximum access for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aerospace Institute, whose first summer tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
The following versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is still necessary to mention Poland's entry into COSPAR (Commission for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the national committee COSPAR two years later.
Poland also participated in space exploration in the Interkosmos programme in Soviet art teams, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remkovi.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the Public Works Act.
The resolution sparked a lively debate in the public.
Of course, it will be interesting to look at the problem in a broader way.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalised world are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
In effect, this means that individual economic services, national economic systems, stand in a permanent conflict between themselves.
The reason is the principle of free trade and free movement, the unrestricted movement of private capital, along with unscrupulous financial speculation.
The impact of significant differences in the price of work (sems) is the result of price tension.
In this respect, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the producer is trying to import the cheap goods into a competition by "stirring" the price of the competitor with the aim of making a greater market share and thereby increasing its own profits.
In the mass measure, this means for most entrepreneurs either to transfer production abroad, or to buy cheaply, or to disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
As private capital has no social responsibility and thus also the unemployment it produces, social expenditures are increasing necessarily.
The whole situation makes it possible to pay taxes to the total negligence of the businessmen and thus to replace the economic and social damage that he has caused in the credit for profit.
The situation is so widely known that no specific statistical data should be provided.
Independent private capital practices create a situation in individual economies where governments of individual countries are forced to enter mutual competition with a view to artificially reducing the social level of their own population to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give private capital the respect of their own population regardless of the social loss.
This is particularly evident in the amendments to the laws in force.
The aim is to economically force its own population to accept the price dictatorship of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
However, this is a system of economic recovery in the case of long-term unemployment, but a limitation of the rights of employees in the field of labour law.
As a result, poverty is growing and the differences between the poor and the rich are growing.
In the SRN there has been a number of years of public food spending for the poor who cannot use their own work.
The number of these people is already up to millions.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a very common situation where properly employed people receive wages such that they must be paid up to an existing minimum.
Such a scandal has also been published in the case of auxiliary employees in the social media.
The controversial measures of virtually all the southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same state of affairs when people are forced to migrate under the pressure of a disaster at social level, as it was in the 19th century, or to live on a hunger strike at the edge of society, hoping that private investment capital will come to the country once.
Where is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
If it is from other EU countries, poverty is moving from one country to another, or will not come at all, because China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt, or Africa are still working for a European pay gap.
It's all about Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media argue that the state cannot participate capital in its own economy, that managed economy leads to an economic disaster.
The private capital shall be considered as not to involve the State in the holding by a direct intervention.
Then we need to ask ourselves whether private capital is not affecting, in fact it is now leading politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
There's a clear answer here, yes.
Evidence of existence is practically omnipotent and in all states an omnipotent lobby.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, providing mutual benefits, legislation, where virtually everything is criminal, but nothing criminal.
In the SRN, the situation is that the government ministries for the lack of financial resources provide for the drafting of draft laws to private legal firms that are clever in connection with industry.
These bills are then approved in the Bundestag.
Not all of this comes from people like Western institutions, but from financially strong groups of people who prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberally oriented democracy is now rapidly gaining into the situation described by Appiános in its part of the crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state has long been fully disbanded and the authorities have been obsessed with violence.
For bribes, illegal acquisitions, and by means of stones or swords.
The payout and corruption were out of bounds and people went to elections with a pre-sold voice" ..."character people were not at all concerned about the office, so once it was a state of eight months without consuls" . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The conclusion, as in the past, is based on the independent preference of its own interests, regardless of the overall public interest.
Private capital is no longer capable of being understood and applied for the benefit of the whole of society.
The result is now, as at the time, an unprecedented decade of elites without any effort to reform a deeper race.
Therefore, we must seek to liberalise the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries without delay.
At present, the gap between these systems in favour of liberal democracy can be seen as a certain break with the expectation of another wheel.
Especially disastrous is the fact that the current elites are completely ignoring possible statistical losses in the lives, humanitarian and social disasters that we are now witnessing together with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not a lasting one.
Under the pressure of competition, both at international and at European level, the Czech Government will continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political-social reforms, which strengthen the State's participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the State.
Israel: Chaos laboratory.
"Nothing comes out of violence and can never come" Sting in the song Fragile whose main verse in the refrene is "let's not forget how we're fragile"

After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, many reactions were generated, as always.
One stands behind Israel, argues by his right to self-defence, and the Palestinians match the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, argue with the Israeli state racism, genocide in the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel matches the role of the terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who has been born into the current political situation and who has not experienced the beginning of violence and who has been killed and who has been regularly repeated by the culprits and the victims, the people of Israel today, including self-government.
This is what I want to offer readers a view of the opona, a view of which has been in service for 95 years (calculated by the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) for a small part of the Middle East country.
Some of my thoughts are supported by the historical facts available, some of them are driven on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main hybrid of the events of modern history.
The facts of mankind are primarily the history of the struggle for power.
We can look for any of this Alexander the Great or Napoleon at any time.
What is not so obvious is whether it was always these personalities who were completely autonomously guiding their steps and whether or not someone was behind their throne who directed their actions towards the stated purpose.
We must admit that we are living at a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals and that this concentration of money and their power cannot be achieved by one generation.
Among these astronomical rich families is an outstanding one that could be considered the head of the chobotnica (if someone is still standing over them I don't know, but I don't exclude it) - Rothschild.
It doesn't say much about them.
Of course.
The first printing agency (Reuters) had already been bought in the 1990s to stop the merger of its name with the highly criminal effects in which they stood and which always meant the strengthening of power, the increase of wealth or both.
They have major shares in almost all central banks of the world and against countries where central bank shares do not lead or prepare wars (before the attack of Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the attack of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the impact of Kaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia subjugated the central bank of the Russian government).
Whoever tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the Rothschild Bank of America, began to spend his own money during the civil war (understanding government) and was murdered in 1865 in the theatre.
JFK began to issue his own money and wanted to abolish the FED, he was murdered in 1963, and MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for a major economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led in the years 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of the plan of the three world wars as the highest, 33rd degree dedication by Albert Pike.
The first war was intended to remove large monarchy states in Europe, the second was to remove colonial rule, in particular the United Kingdom, and the third is to lead to a reduction of the world population to some 0.5 to 1 billion people (such a quantity of slaves for their comfort and luxury is sufficient and need not so much resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a precondition for such a solution) and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method used by a group of the richest families in front of Rothschieldy is the trigger of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab chao - order of chaos).
These solutions, however, are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of the EDF, so that the crisis like the one they started in 1907 does not happen again).
So after they succeeded in killing Habsburg's successor R-U throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo to launch the first world war, the Russian Empire destroyed by launching the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended suddenly, military and economicly unwarranted, the capital of Germany (there was no need for war to destroy the Russian Empire) and subsequently broke the central European power, Austria Uherska.
To facilitate the resolution of the second world war, the politicians left behind a situation of latent conflict by calling for huge war repairs on Germany, creating a precondition for radicalisation of the masses and then only encouraged the Germans to be strong enough, to blame the leaders and to provide a simple solution to the warfire, and further to create a multinational Czechoslovakian with a strong German minority, which was supposed to prevail, and also to exacerbate, the function of the fifth colony, when the warfire started.
At the end of the 19th century, Rothschild’s foundation of the Zionist movement, whose one poem sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judah with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration already mentioned created a precondition for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, beginning to come to the first shoots with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The second world war broke out if Hitler broke out of the chain on which the international bankers held him at first, or everything he had done was difficult to estimate, any suffering of European Jews in concentration created a prerequisite for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, like the war repairs made by Germany in World War II, a third war was set up by the declaration of the State of Israel.
If it can be disputed by international bankers, the Jewish nation, like in the second, will be the victims of the first line of battle, now together with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of weight and chaos not only within the country, but also in international scale (we take only as strong people are divided into supporters and supporters of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim of the Palestinian - Israeli conflict, where the crime is brought about by violence in an endless chain of violence when, at the beginning of all, the poverty of individuals and their desire for global power became a reality?
There is a need to distinguish the simple inhabitants of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers insist on the election of people in elections exclusively their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Netanyahu, is a typical example of the fascination, with international bankers loyal, a policy that is doing everything to unravel war with Iran, which, in view of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatens to increase in global conflict and in view of Iran's control over the Hormuz Peninsula, which travels 20% of all the world's oil (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide) and the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with the new world order."
The new world order in their imagination is the world of lords and slaves.
The world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of financial aristocracy.
A world where every new born entity is implanted in the birth of a chip that makes it a completely controlled being.
"And force all the small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have right hand or the front of the cup, that he may not buy or sell, who is not marked by the name of that cup or the number of its name.
That's what we need to understand: who has the right to count the numbers of that slam.
This number represents a man and that's the number six hundred sixty-six."
Film Argo: When it's worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of demonstrating Islamic students held an American embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats as hostages.
They were to be released as a replacement for the caste of Mohammed Réz Páhalvi, who, after the revolution, fled to the United States, who had been the patron of his regime for several decades.
For the US administration, the situation did not offer a positive east side - it could not afford to throw chess across the board, because it would essentially endanger the trust of allies in other countries.
The release of hostages, however, in Iran, where the revolution has led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, has not been able to achieve.
It was the morning for the United States prestige, which later exacerbated the fiasco's attempt to free power.
The diplomats were finally released after 444 days after the negotiation was mediated by the Algerian government.
Their contribution at home caused the wave of solidarity and the anti-Iranian sentiment.
The debate in Iran has made a significant contribution to the loss of Jimmy Carter with Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film directed by actor Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of the story that America has brought a small victory.
Just before the embassy was seized, six employees fled.
After complicated peripecies, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian embassy.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them from Iran, while helping the extravagant cover story - they went to Canadian passports as members of the film staff, who looked at the location in the country for filming a sci-fi big movie.
Combined Genres
The plan that invented an expert on "exfiltration" by Tony Mendez also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
To make the legend credible, it was written about a film project in specialized magazines, held a press conference, a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been hidden for a long time, the film comes from Tony Mendez's memory.
Afflekk's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realisticly perceived political thriller, also called "caper movie", the story of a piece, a surprise - can be an example of Danny's series.
In the film, the moods - on one side of the documentary sequence from Tehran (the title sequence shows the iconic time photography of events and the manner in which the same situation was presented in the film - there are no big differences in that).
On the other hand, isolated passports from Hollywood, arranged with irony and a slight overlap.
And then there are scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in the suit are breaking up the situation at the negotiating tables, at the office's halls, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has made a remarkable contribution to restarting his career.
From a funny actor, he became a respected director, and his acting stopped being the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third film all night, after the dark crime of Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller of the City (2010).
At the same time, it's the first Affleck's video that's not being played in the director's home Boston.
Cit for the atmosphere of the place, however, was among the characteristics that the director's older films had raised above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck also shows it in Arg, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film are played in the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the initial sequence of the Embassy's fall is in its overview, which also mediates the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that occur when history is cleared somewhere.
Similar effects of Affleck and its collaborators are achieved in the scene of thought (false staff on the Tehran Basar).
Too many events in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story reported does not actually offer much in the film-based sense of tense scenes.
It's not working well enough, and sometimes it's thinking something real - it's not all so elegantly coming out there (the scene in which a dangerous crisis at Tehran airport turns the phone in America and the knife after the wound is quite attracted to the hair).
The weakness of Arga, however, is the dissipation resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in the roles of Hollywood co-workers, but their figures would deserve more space and they are not far from alone in this film.
Afklek's film is so little lost in dramatic tach, it's a picture that can be monitored with a slight interest, evaluate the realization and retro style evocating thrillery 70 years.
But it's just hard.
As a reminder of a certain way of living history and the evidence of the exaggerated ideas of all - powerful and all - aware secret services, it is sufficient.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipopakky.com, which publishes the survey annually on the most absurd banking fee, has now decided to issue a competition on "the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU industry".
"It led us to the last event when the EU plans to accept a 40% quota for women in the management of large European companies," said the Law organizer of the Patrick Naker survey.
For example, the recent European Court of Justice decision on the unification of insurance rates for men and women has already been included among the nominated absurdities.
Thus far, women have benefited from life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky for insurance.
"More incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote alone will then take place by the end of February 2013," Naker informed.
The EU controversial regulation also requires the mandatory mixing of biodegradable substances into natural substances, resulting in damage to nature, further banning the use of reliable mercury temperatures only because they contain a relatively small quantity of dangerous substances, or a directive on the size of blind cells, for which the eggs have been significantly damaged this year.
The criticism was also preceded by a fact-finding ban on the use of the expression of anointed butter or the removal of classical lamps from the sale.
Quality bananas have 14 centimeters
The Union apparatus often decides under pressure from the commercial or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels are usually met by some state or group of states (this is where the Czech Republic now and the threat of veto is promoting the requirements of its banks).
The lobby interest was also due to the fact that, for example, the highest quality bananas in the Union had to reach a length of at least 14 cm and not to show "anomalous distortion".
At the same time, the European Commission has defended itself by harmonising only today's incompatible national standards that have complicated trade.
The EU's standards of fruit and vegetables, through the resistance of some states, have confused by the fact that existing directives lead to food consumption.
The candidate for victory in the survey may also be the last EU regulation, which requires that children who are under 8 years of age should not be inflamed without adult supervision.
The EU has relied on American research, according to which the balloons between players lead to the death of children to breath.
Similar restrictions are now applicable for children up to 14 years of age when flaking into puppies.
Curious ideas are born at home
It is a rather absurd rule, then, for the European officials themselves - everyone who has any official function in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia in view of the sensitivity of the theme for Greece and must instead speak about FYROM (Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
The Banking Fees.com server, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Fair, nominated for the poll in addition to some of the above-mentioned absurdities of the EU Regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of the Member State.
The EU has determined the maximum quantities of food stocks that could be found in the territory of the PRC on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the established volumes of preserved mushrooms, which threatened him with a high heel.
The organizers of the survey also raised the idea of paying some countries for having no sea, and the idea of granting grants on the request for grants.
These ideas, however, did not come up in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are disabled by having no sea.
We ask the European Union to repay," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (CSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, we were born with a lot of crops and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, we had to have full funds that had to be exported.
In view of the fact that the Czech Republic continues to have ports, the EU should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros, according to the Palais.
Finally, the European Commission came out of the Czech Republic by organising a tender for the purchase of crops from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive the grant was offered to the local ministry for local development managed by Minister Pavl Germany (US-DEU), specifically to go to write a request for a grant from Brussels.
EU: Bistrial Regulation is an exception
Although the rules are easily criticised in the Member States, EU regulatory efforts and at the same time more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve greater recognition, according to a number of experts.
The more serious problem is, according to experts, for example, the spending of EU grants on projects that do not have anything to do with the deepening of European integration, but which the Member States have won in budgetary negotiations.
The emotion between the Czech Republic is also driven by the fact that, like the other Union countries, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to specific labelling of its traditional products in Brussels, and not always succeed in this conflict.
Although after the sixth battle with the Germans and the Rakušany, the Czechs came to mark the Olomoucian forms, but the foreign rum, the tradition of which goes back to the 19th century, had to be named by our producers.
The name of the rum may be carried only from the third distillate, not from the sugar beet.
In the official list of EU registered products, in the company of world-famous cheeses of feta and gorgonzol, marzipan from Germany, Lübeck or parm hams, for example carnivorous sugar, raspberry and raspberry starch.
The EU's protection mark can then also be proud of pardubic feathers and hot tubes.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm an amateur, tough Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how does a person think he wants to run for president?
I don't care if I'm a senator or a president.
If it works in our country without problems, I don't care.
But I can't see how the country's been stealing for the last 20 years, how the thieves are running, people are getting taxed and the age of retirement.
I wasn't supposed to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, I try to figure out how to change it.
And since I've been forty and I'm an independent citizen, I have no other way to influence things than to run for a senator or president.
You've reached the Senate, but you've come out to the Garden.
Don't you turn your back on the people who chose you?
I've been saying that I'm going to fight the Garden as a result of the Senate election.
Later, I made it clear that if I were elected senator, I would run for the president.
But my goal is not a function, a function is a tool, how can I make my vision come true.
That's why I need the greatest influence and the strongest mandate.
But the trouble is not only that as a nation we're giving up on the house and on TV, but that we're going to drown anyone who wants to try to change.
In addition, the media that denounze people and that distort freedom of speech lie with freedom of speech.
I may have claimed that I was paying for the press or that I was Jrí Paroubka's advisor.
Let's go to your visas.
In the fight for the Garden, you have emerged with your weight and criminal responsibility for policies and the return of property confessions of over 20 million.
You have to change the law to that.
As president, you have no such authority and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this?
When I, as a citizen, lobbyed for leadership to be a free life, it was a success.
The problem is politics - when someone comes with a good proposal to the left or the right, they say they refuse, and that keeps the citizens from doing so.
As an independent citizen, I have much greater potential to get support from all parliamentary parties.
My privilege is that without page sketching and dogmat I can take something that's best for our country on every side and apply it.
You think you're more of a right-wing man or a left-wing man?
From a Czech perspective, it seems to me that people are looking at me more on the left.
It doesn't matter to me whether it's a bit left or a bit of transport.
It's important to me that we move forward.
I don't care if anyone belongs to the left or the right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any public good solution, even if it is proposed by the KSCHM or the ODS, and I will be against the wrong idea anyway.
You get hurt when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you make a business plan at the company, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
And you're trying to get closer to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already working in the world, or important experts have been talking about them.
But without Parliament's support, you'll only have passwords left.
And that's not enough in politics for a long time.
Or do you think that if you follow people and talk to them, for example, you will be able to carry out a criminal and serious responsibility?
I don't have a choice.
Convinced of politics, journalists and the public and trying to get them on our side to overcome it.
If I have been elected President, it is not a problem to arrange a direct television broadcast, where I ask the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the important and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and state representatives.
And they might have to tell us why they don't want her.
If there's a strong personality that's going to name the dirty ones, you can press the political scene.
Take the President's direct choice, it was a public press duty.
On the balance, I say I'm an amateur, I'm not a genius or an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I'm trying to look for allies.
I have just started in politics and I will try to get most support for my program.
I'm trying to move things myself, if it doesn't work out, in six years I'm going to end up and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a little like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything in one person, so I've been running a number of famous people to make sure they don't go to the Senate too.
I went after Radim Janchuru, who refused a lot of work.
So at least I supported investigative journalist Jan Lorenc, who was covering up frauds with light heat oils.
I ran into people being really upset, but now I'm in trouble.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the elections, and those who went chose most of the representatives of the establishment.
We're just two independent in the Senate.
People called on the Senate so that changes would be made difficult.
However, I will fight for my vision, such as for the direct choice of the elderly or the heitman.
You're thinking about setting up your own party?
I haven't considered it yet, because I don't have time to check the clean past of every potential party, and I don't have any money on it.
I don't have any money on the presidential campaign, but on my transparent account, there's only 20,000.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property confessions, what's yours?
Private property is estimated to be 60 million.
In Prague, I have a land of about 25 million, an apartment of ten million, another apartment of eight million, a collection of works of art of about ten million, Aston Martin of 3.5 million, and Skud Superb for a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have Aston Martin because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove in the car, was gallant to women, and at the same time fought against evil and evil.
You drive Aston Martin, you own 60 million and you don't have any money on the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
That's not too convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Is that what I'm supposed to owe you?
I've already shot 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors proves that my program is probably not that interesting.
And I don't have to pay for my campaign.
The cost of the campaign will essentially cover what I'm going to get a senator's salary.
But I wouldn't survive it, for example, I couldn't pay my son an English school worth 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't give up anywhere.
So you're gonna keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd decide these activities?
But it doesn't matter how much you pay.
As I promised, I have partially resolved my activities.
For example, a travel agent will become my representative in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who will save the Republic.
But I also need to live with something.
How many businessmen have you been used to taking a month?
Two hundred to 400 thousand, which I take further.
And if I were president, I'd end my business.
You will find the entire interview in the Saturday edition of the Law.
Architects MVRDV are proof that real adventures are not only in the head - for example Spijkennis and recently built Hora books - 2 pictures
"This building seems to me happy, futuristic. Finally it is again to see something interesting," says Lisette Verhaig, who goes around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, IT technology in a nearby big business, says, "Of course, this house is nice."
But I wonder what we still need a library for today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and electronic books.
None of these old-fashioned books are volunteering today, are they?
Spijkennis, a location close to Rotterdam without its own work opportunities that are not even worth a visit, holds a special record.
This area of 80,000 people shows the lowest level of education throughout the Netherlands.
In order to solve this stupid situation, a few years ago the decision fell to contribute to universal education and to build seven beautifully painted iron concrete miniatures of fictitious bridges that are displayed on euro banknotes.
The success of the offensive education, but it wasn't that bad.
And so the city councils knew that there is only one way to become the masters of statistics: we must have a library!
Wine Maas from the Rotterdam architectural workshop MVRDV, master of bold column charts and designer of funny, often even cynic buildings, took over the thing with normal calm and at the competition in 2003 he appeared with five books under the care and brilliance on the face.
And while the Commission looked around and shook its shoulders in awe, Maas poured out his gifts to himself according to size and his activistly reasoned speech ended the words "Dear City Village!"
So this is my proposal on the Mountain of Books in Spijkennisse, called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, a 30 million-euro mountain was designed.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential and row homes with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Hora book was named the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated at the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
The small-town grass, which has not yet been offered more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unusually bad worker whose white facade you would rather expect a dairy, is richer than a bit of contemporary architecture.
Above all, however, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of his existence.
A Long Way to Book
First sentence: reader's fireworks under the cheese cover.
By means of a mass of mountains, however, lifts, but you will discover real spatial and readerial passions until you walk through topography.
On all sides, the paved interior is bright and transparent, the floor of the burning cabron and elegant street lights clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The city environment is perfect.
You see the park benches, the dog and the boys and the girls playing football.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"There are usually rules with books along the facades and in the middle is a big dark space, which is mostly involuntarily and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We built a classic space configuration up our feet and space for the reader we moved out.
Innřek Hory books are excellently used: on Wednesday there are offices, Internet library, chess club, ecological center and central home techniques.
Special comfort is the black police on books that are once covered with walls, one parapet and the other with stairs.
Look, the structure and the smell affect the alien.
Over the unknown building material, the heads even bend the architects and construction engineers.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, the head of the project in the town of Spijkenisse, to ask Standard magazine.
And so we found a suitable waste product from agriculture in a fresh farm one day.
For many years it has been used as a base under the root of the millimeter of synthetic material in glass and in the fields in the Netherlands.
It's cheap and time-effective.
The thin textile will last one, two seasons, and then it's mature for disposal into bulk waste.
For the library it was run - first in such a quantity - on a thickness board of four centimeters.
The effect of the fire and pressure on the so-called Agricultural Plastic (CLP) will be in a dark, homogeneous and heavy material that will touch a little like a new car and a little like sports boots.
You'll reach the top of 105 feet.
At the end of nearly 500 meters of long journey you will be rewarded in the literary café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and figurines in flowers.
You're taking care of the atmosphere, but mostly of the correct humidity of the air in the literature.
Gifts for a New Soul
"You probably wouldn't believe it, but this house is in spite of a lot of glassed areas with a demonstration project on ecology," Trouborst says.
It melts and cools with earth's heat.
Though the mountain of the Book stands under a glass roof, the sun only shines within a short period of time, even in the sun’s day.
Widely fine wooden lockers, which stand at the edge of the façade, serve as a protection and capture a large part of the sun’s radiation.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
With the rest, they can handle fully automatic roles.
Stefan Spermon, an IT industry initial skeptic, has already visited a new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there.
And also a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogard, which Boekenberg even designates as "a long-awaited soul" Spijkenisse.
Reason: Each city resident was invited to open a book from his own personal fund a few weeks ago.
Thus, optical spaces should be first filled in so far not fully equipped library, which currently contains 70,000 pieces.
The concept is certified.
The police are completely filled.
"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation, every citizen has a certain relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if she was just in the mood.
This was done by MVRDV in the royal discipline, which is called the creation of identity in the expert jargon.
Spijkennies wrote history of literature.
Whatever it is, it's young and uneducated.
That's finally the starting point for identity.
Shabo: "The Germans have to play a bigger role"
Germany abstained from voting when deciding on the adoption of Palestine.
According to an expert on relations between the USA and Europe, Stephen Szaboa thus balanced Berlin on the narrow border of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first signaled that it would vote against the proposal for the observer status of the Palestinians in the United Nations.
Then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Schabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he'll even support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, of course, being too critical to Israel.
During the rise in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting when it came to establishing a free zone.
That's where NATO finally survived.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that it is precisely changing its foreign policy, and that it is from a policy that has been simply controlled by the United States, to a German foreign policy.
The situation is more difficult than the fact that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans are between the fronts.
They are expected to play an independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're just staying in their role, but they're on their way to "normal" foreign policy.
To foreign policy, which they have in France or in the United Kingdom.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows willingness to take on national interests and positions that are independent of the positions of the United States or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. export and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are to some extent different from the economic interests of other powers, and that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interest affect the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
First, Germany has a large resort in the Middle East, especially in the states around the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, it must be careful not to frighten the public, but not elites in the Arab countries.
Well, that's what it's like to play.
I don't want to add too much importance to that, but it's not just a one-sided relationship.
However, it plays a very important role in German thinking.
Did Germany's relationship with the United States damage when both important decisions were held, for example in the course of the Palestinian vote?
I think that in Europe and even in the United States there will be a great understanding for the German position.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic as Libya's question.
I hope that Germany will even earn some respect.
This indicates that it must be considered as an international player and its interests must be taken into account.
There are various views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The U.S. has made a clear statement about the veto.
Are there differences in opinion between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of American internal policy.
I think that Obama's government is probably losing a considerable understanding of the European position.
But as a result of the darker political situation, this attitude cannot, of course, be stopped by the public.
I don't think differences in opinion are really as big as they always seem.
When you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all very interested in Netanyahu's policy.
Is it not difficult for Germany to establish in line with its close relationship with Israel and the USA on the one hand and with the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it difficult for the Germans.
For Germany, of course, it would be a little easier if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not happening at present.
So they can't be part of a wider line and they have to take things ahead of their own position instead.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead in the future and push Europe into a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of its relationship with Israel.
That was always a sensitive topic.
But I think it's clear to the Germans that they have to play an independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player?
Or is the leading role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult to play a greater role for this country.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, when Germany assumes a greater role, anti-German moods will arise.
That doesn't make it difficult for the Germans.
It's really an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by enemy countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be acceptable to the most diverse neighbours and opinions, and it is not easy.
The influence of the United States in European politics is constantly falling, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment.
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, they're uncomfortable and they'll make it even more popular - c'est la vida!

"Protected brand" in China: when Puma and Armani are all of a sudden Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren too.
What about Armani Polo?
This is followed by a label that is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, they need protection for as long as they are not blamed by actual trademark owners.
And it's not even clear if they're going to get the right.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing's office, who specializes in violating rights in the Far East.
Every week, there's a new case coming up on my writing table.
A few letters are enough for the falsifiers to register their badges.
From the Gucci brand, for example, Lu-Gucci will become and instead of Prada will be allowed to register Prada-Kny.
In this way, German companies are legally copied, or Puma’s sports product manufacturer.
Pattloch opens the order with the registers of the Marking Office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, one Chinese company left to protect Zegna DF Puma’s brand. An artificial name that also parasites at Ermenegildo Zegna’s fashion house.
It is known that the Chinese are the world's masters in copying and violating mental property.
In large cities there are several commercial houses, in which pets are sold almost exclusively.
However, the patent cases are different. From the mandate of its mandates, it is against the fact that the Chinese companies have the right to use the label that has already been protected somewhere else from the trademark.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", the associated brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan."
That's what women are talking about, hunting rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It hurts the trade, we have to chase it," Pattloch calls out.
"The badge is disbanded, the exclusive position is gone, the damage of the image is huge."
Financial losses and the costs of the affected industries go to millions, especially in the case of expensive sample products.
According to data from the CLSA market research company, China is the third largest market in luxury goods and markets that is growing as fast as possible.
However, the identification of the questionable records in the registration mark can be difficult and something is worth it.
The operation can be extended to nine years, with the same result.
Pattloch will report cases where the court has rejected the complaint because the name printed has become a long term term "market reality".
When the complainant has a bad side, he still has to pay for it because he damaged his badge in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle reigns here.
Known cases include graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost his legal dispute with the manufacturer of construction machinery Sany, a company that recently took over the German producer pumped on the Putzmeister concrete mixture.
Therefore, the Chinese are allowed to use a emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Geely, who bought Volvo, originally used a blue logo that reminded BMW. The spore was balanced, Geely had to change the logo.
Lacoste’s fashion product producer lost China with a Hong Kong and Singapore fan who turned the known crocodiles in the wrong direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
In 2010, the CTMO authorities admitted that there were insufficient staff and space for too few employees.
But last year, it was reportedly "the work process returned from the emergency situation to normal".
For example, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings decreased by 22 per cent.
There were 57,000 of these cases closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, there are still 81,500 complaints pending at the office.
Something to do against it is expensive
As often as it is in China, it's impressive numbers.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record and it means that China is behind it is leading a list of new applications around the world.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks - of which there are a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were selected at the fees.
This simply means that every application on average is worth 1280 june or 160 euros.
The beginning of this dispute is a number of things, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
This group has been fighting the Chinese plagiarism for more than seven years.
The Germans have achieved the abolition of its illegal production of imitation car parts.
However, the facilitator secured Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand still.
We would remind ourselves of this because in Germany the names cannot be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The TCMO’s reputation also rejected the opposition of the Munich company.
In the other two instances, Freudenberg gained the right, but the resistance in the dispute continues to fight today.
We need to be very careful.
Now the matter is discussed at the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the matter will lead to a good end and commend the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "Driving is extremely expensive, and it takes us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be counted. In the company's archive, they had to even look at hundreds of years of old records to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg, on the other hand, offered a "high sixth amount in euros" for the purpose of settling the dispute.
"You see what it means for us," says Wenzler.
The danger of the Far East also threatens Europe.
And in case the copyrs get unprotected.
One Chinese producer, for example, wanted to sign up in Germany for Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This area of business has long been given up, but it has been able to withdraw registration.
"It's necessary to be careful," says Wentzler.
He and Pattloch counsel German companies to be very careful in dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trade marks rights. Citizens would rather have "everything that stands for protection, even in China," says Wenzler.
Otherwise, it could be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg, in the last story of his drama, is subject to a sign, then it is likely that it will have to pay the licence fees on its own behalf on the other hand, explains Wenzler.
Or we'll be pushed out of the market in the disputed segment.
World Day of Fighting AIDS: Assembling, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, the congregation of Imbongi is being tested - and in Swaziland, there are the joys of orphans after the parents who died of AIDS.
The history of the connection, which exceeds much more than 8733 kilometers.
First of all, there's assembling: cowboy high shoes, basketball shoes, ladies' boats and ladies' mocasins are looking for a tat park and they're looking for it fast.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - slowly rise up, moms and each other reach.
The 29-year-old conductor Fiete Hopfa almost lifts it from his textile shoes when he connects his voices with his hairy wild gestures.
It's Monday night. In the musical dream of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the congregation of Imbongi is testing a new song.
There were 50 singers and singers between 23 and 69 years of age, from the researcher of human genetics to the household.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy composition, each congregation voice has a different text and, in addition, in a very foreign language - zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesothu, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self - Help
Unaids, the United Nations Programme for AIDS Abuse, estimates that around 34 million people are infected with HIV worldwide.
Of that 23.5 million live in South Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 orphans by parents who died of AIDS.
HIV positive is already more than 40% of the population.
For 180 orphans by parents who died of AIDS, in the village of Esitni, the Voicees for Africa found patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend second grade school.
In 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take over the patronage.
Guarantees children a school, a school uniform and a hot meal every day in the Gogo centre.
Imbongi means in the Zulu language a "reparation of stories" or also "the one who worships."
No one can speak in this room with a gas tank, just sing.
For nearly ten years he has been practicing the congregation of songs in this foreign soft speech, and sometimes he also brings them back to where they originally came from: South Africa.
At an air distance of 8,733 km from Heidelberg, it is located in the northeastern part of the Swedish Kingdom of the village of Esitni, which depends on the ability of the voices of the German congregation.
Forty percent Is Infected
Some 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay or strawberries. Most of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they've been infected with HIV.
In Estonia it is seen in small, as the whole of Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to UNICEF.
The male prenup section, which manifestly reduces the risk of infection by half, does not accept the population.
More than 40 percent of the people in Swaziland are carrying the virus of weakened immunity within themselves, and there is no frequency that they die in the next 30 years.
This village was found on a joint trip to Africa in spring 2005. Above all, however, the members of Imbongi saw many children on the streets that were missing not only parental care, but also clean everything: food, clothing, education.
Without an end to school education, they have no chance in the poor country.
At first, it was a private placement of individuals, which allowed a couple of euros a year to send a child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
However, a year later, a group of "Voices for Africa" was established, which has been taking care of orphans after parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial SPIs include syphilis, chlamydia and parsley (gonorrhea).
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papillomavir, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Mounds and scratches belong to parasitic SPI.
Who belong to the most deprived group?
Syphilis and pigs are especially common in men who have sex with men.
The constitution of Robert Kocha is based on the fact that at least four of the five cases of syphilides reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases often occur, Chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candidosis (nearness), swine and human papillomavir.
HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults, but about 20 percent of newly infected HIV belongs to this group.
Among young people, Chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently than in other population groups.
According to European research, three quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15-25 years.
In addition, human papillomaviruses are common among young people.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
According to Robert Kocha, the number of syphilids infected was more than doubled in 2001 than in 2011, according to the Robert Kocha Institute.
The number of newly infected persons has decreased since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
It's about a decade less than a year ago.
What are some signs of sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases may cause fever in the area of genitalia, difficulty in urine, rash, abdominal pain, or chest pain.
Often, however, no pain or other symptoms occur, and therefore they remain unwarranted.
How can we protect ourselves?
Hazardous diseases can reduce condoms, but they do not offer a high level of protection.
Because the origins of sexually transmitted diseases can be partially transmitted also infection from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, in particular in the case of frequent sexual intercourse.
In the case of timely diagnostics, it is possible to cure most SPI and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to the patronage, charity gifts, and in the last series of honors that the congregation earns by singing throughout Germany, some money is collected.
"We have already sent about 200,000 euros to Estonia," said the president of the company Annette Lennartz.
Money from Germany manages in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious woman who can sow.
He also cares about the search for the victims, such as some of his grandmother's children.
Gogo, as the language Zulu calls old women, is the village's resistance.
Some of them also took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads, and made sure that the children were delivered to the school every day in uniforms.
Children who no longer have anyone, go to the Khanyisile shelter, a lonely woman paid by the community as well as two cooks who cook daily for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" founded a sewer school, built two cooks, and together with the American health organization PSI arranged that many people in the village had to do a HIV test.
It's not obvious, even if the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone's quieting about it.
King of 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because she has something to do with sexuality."
In fact, it's quite strange in the country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absoluteist monarch of black Africa, King Miswati III, is known for his immeasurable lifestyle.
Let's compare the place of democracy.
This country's approved way of life is also guilty of the fact that HIV has spread so rapidly over the past few decades.
But also many migrant workers who spread the virus across the country.
Annette Lennartz says condoms are free on every corner, "but no one uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected contact."
To at least support cultural exchange, the congregation travels Imbongi once in two, three years together in South Africa and sings songs full of sorrow, fighting, confidence in the future and self-confidence of black people who have known many in the southern tip of the Black continent since the time of apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the language of the blacks - such appreciation brings not only mood and joy, but also tears have already gone out among many wild foreign soldiers.
The way leads always to Estonia, where the singers visit the children over whom they have patronage.
Although this village is hard to find on maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is more than known.
"Go to Estonia, there's light," people say.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is from here an air-circuit 8733 kilometers, to the hummingbirds in the experiment at Bergheimer Straße, you can see that the light is shining here.
Messenger: NASA discovered on Mercury ice
Sonda Messenger has found evidence that Mercury is frozen on planet Earth.
The ice cover could have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The US National Aviation and Cosmonautique Agency (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although close to the Sun, there is also frozen water as it comes out of three studies that published the "Science" professional magazine Thursday.
Sonda Messenger has found evidence that in the area of this planet, which lies in the permanent shadow, there is an ice cover.
It's probably at least 30 centimeters and maybe up to 20 meters strong.
This water came according to everything from the comet or perhaps even from the asteroids that attacked Mercury.
But let's not find ice in relation to the existence of life on this planet, said leading scientists working on the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help us to explain how water and other basic elements of life have become part of other areas of the solar system.
The probes, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix, undetected land, with a partial exploration of the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they've been taking pictures to Earth, a small window to endless distances.
The image comes from a photographic device that developed German scientists from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, besides the suffering planet Ceres.
As with Pluto, which circles around the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not, according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006 "planet".
This cut from the infrared image of Spitzer's telescope shows the "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue points, the most identifiable are pink-coloured "new-faced" stars in the birth room of the stars.
This area, where the stars are made - scientists call it W5 unromantically - has discovered Spitzer's telescope in Cassiopeia's constellation in the distance of 6500 light years.

One of Hubble's greatest and most outstanding images of telescope: faith galaxy
The images of spiral galaxies are, according to their coloring, becoming real art pieces.
The drawing published by the European Southern Observer shows a few thousand light years away from the Trifid mill in the constellation of the Shooter.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, triple), because the dark dust strips form the burning heart of this star birthplace on three parts.
In the constellation of Hadonos, astronomers photographed the presence of a cosmic crash: at 400 million light-years from Earth, the core of two galaxies are at its core and must inevitably reach the wheel.
This star birth recorded Hubble's telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Whoever doesn't like technical shorts can call her the name of the South Windmill.
Photo from Hubble's space wide view shows the intersection of Iris' mill in Cefea's constellation.
These 1400 light years are made up of dust grains, which are ten times as much as the usual household dust.
This picture was composed of optical and x-ray images of various telescopes.
It displays a ring of black holes that is 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273, recorded Hubble's cosmic remote view of NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this starry mill, there is the clearest group of young stars in our Milky Ways.
The cluster of stars gives rise to new growths.
Also, these star clouds, connected to the Rosette mill, still produce new young stars. They are 5,000 light years away from Earth.
There's still no dust in this clear gray galaxy with a small black hole, but only gas.
Scientists believe that it was just a short time after the Great Depression when it was mostly hydrogen throughout the universe.
Our views on space: the most important telescopes
The remote view was reportedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey. Even before Galileo, he later used it to observe stars.
Since then, optical remote views have been increasing - and the perspectives that are mediating are still deeper.
The world’s largest remote view has been for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, Hale’s telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror on this picture had a diameter of five meters.
Large Binocular Telescope stands in the American Arizona.
It allows you to look into the universe using two mirrors, each of which has a diameter of 8.4 meters.
Innřek Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only mirror measures on average 10,4 meters.
The South African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to reduce costs.
Yet its diameter reaches about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the cheap design method: the telescope is provided by hackodad in the high angle, limiting its mobility.
There is also a Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas.
His specialty is a high-strengthening of the light stream.
In spite of relatively small diameter, this is equal to the world's largest mirror farsightedness.
Radiotelescopes in Arecibu (Portorico) are being watched by scientists in space by extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope has an average of 305 meters.
In "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - looking for extraterrestrial intelligence - can help any computer owner who provides its computational performance.
Look at the observation of the European Southern Observer (ESO) in the Chilean Andeans.
There's a Very Large Telescope standing here and honoring his name.
This remote view with a total of four mirrors can also brighten the middle infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large remote view is also planned for Chilean ESO observers.
Its main mirror shall be full of 42 meters and shall consist of nearly 1000 mirrors.
However, the images can be counted first in 2018.
Two Keck's remote views of Mauna Kea's Hawaiian soup were considered the largest in the world by 2007.
They're offering two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
Keckov's remote views are part of the Mauna Kea observator, who is looking beyond them into space and using the telescope Subaru and IRTTF.
Also on Mauna Kea is going to create a new large telescope - with a mirror diameter of 30mm.
Here you can admire her in the picture.
However, the most important perceptions from the universe is that of Hubble's cosmic remote view.
The arrests of remote worlds have been providing us with since 24 April 1990.
The Kepler Space Telescope has been searching since March 2009 for extrasolar planets - especially for those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets have been identified since the beginning of the mission.
The image contains the last preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
Space Remote View James Webba (JWST) will first be launched in 2018 into space on board the Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to seek the light of the first stars and galaxies by the Great Trek.
Scientists are based on the fact that there's ice on the southern field of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as the Messenger crosses this planet far closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that it is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was sent in 2004 and is the first one that is going around Mercury, scientists now have confidence.
Drink butter daily and you are 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live in Bible times.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Looking for a trail in a country where 97 years of age are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live in Bible times.
There's even a museum of longevity.
Looking for a trail in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
I'm going to burn Talysh, and we can call the savage romantic.
The microbus of counting along the road with many stops along densely forested hills, ancient rivers and plain village buildings.
It's all green and juicy, if it looks like we're in Schwarzwald.
But this one here is the worst in Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here is a Caucasian ethnic group of the Talyshes, which is not known enough to speak perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani, and is living at a very high age.
The final station is Lerik.
This city is haunted by too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which does not fit in the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe are not coming here. Arrival from Azerbaijan's capital Baku is too easy.
It takes eight hours for 323 kilometers because the road is only one-way.
The historic wealth for which the country thanks oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet reached the countryside.
Pilata Fatulaieva (48) is convinced, however, that Lerik has to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku celebrated the Great Eurovision price in May - and we will have the oldest festival in the world next year," Fatulajeva says.
He's the director of a long-term museum, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of almost eight dozen Talyshs from the surrounding area who are hundreds of years old. Fatulayeva shows black and white pictures.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he still had a baby.
However, the contested star of this museum is the shepherd of the sheep of Şirali Müslümov, which was apparently 168 years old.
Of course, there's no such thing as a birth certificate.
And since the oldest man with the evidence was 122 years old, Muslim age seems to be quite questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulaieva explains.
This man was supposed to be married three times and had 23 children.
So he wasn't wrong about Şirali Muslim in his age for a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist of the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard about the flying people in Central Asia.
"Schoolz says, "also lives in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunz Valley in Pakistan."
However, no scientific evidence of age can be provided due to the lack of evidence, especially when the matrix is missing.
Each day a glass of dissolved butter
The fact is, though, that people in the area around Leric have a history of Bible age.
There are currently 20 people who are 100 years of age.
Why, then, do so many people live here in the south?
Azerbaijan's leader Farid Mugimzadeh explains this to the special Thai genes.
On the contrary, the director of Fatul's museum believes it's in the food.
However, just the caloric food of the Talyshes who love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products, and of which many drink a glass of dissolved butter daily, is so healthy, from a bromatological point of view it does not seem quite plausible.
Or is this the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement near the city of Lerik, the village of Rubab Mirzajev.
At 97 years of age, she is still relatively young at this latitude.
Mirzajeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He's sitting on the ground with a butcher that he's chewing on.
Under one roof, eight people live here, including one of the sons of Mirza's and daughter's, both of whom are fathers long ago.
There's two little kids jumping around.
In the kitchen, a tea is prepared for guests, which is given in typical "armada" bottles.
The white teeth of Mirza's teeth form a perfect row and under the coat hide a long dark blonde copy that proudly conceals her son from us.
I always liked my hair with milk, so they didn't look like me and they kept their color.
"That's how I've never used shampoo," says Mirzaev.
The monthly income for life is enough
She always ate just what came from her own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, games.
For the rest of my life, I never bought food in a supermarket once.
Then he'll tell me about his man who was in the army.
It was the worst in World War II.
But it all improved when he took over the "loved father" Geidar Aliev.
Propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which is made round about the throne of the father of the nations, who ruled his land as governor, knoweth no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, then took over his son Ilham.
Old people in Azerbaijan at least don't have to suffer.
Mirzajeva receives a salary of 230 manats every month (approximately the same amount in euros). This is the area from which you can benefit.
And maybe he's right, and a long time ago, Mirza's son, "Old people live in our culture of great seriousness."
They live in the middle of a large family, are loved, cared for, and happy.
If that's not the reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of "lid law" in the constitution is missing
The revolution has returned to Kahiry.
Angry demonstrations in Cairo revealed the country's deep dissatisfaction.
A sharp debate is being held on the future constitution based on the right of the Sharia.
The Egyptian president didn't run a path.
We need to create a transition.
"And for our success, I'm responsible, before people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was directed to the whole nation, especially to the Christian Coptics, the liberals, the enlightened Muslims, and the secular people.
All of you, so far, hopelessly disunity in a confused opposition, that's why they're afraid.
Fear of "the state of God" on the Nile for the mercy of a powerful Muslim brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursí almost apologisedly announced that he temporarily restricted the jurisdiction of the constitutional court and extended his own to "protect the revolution".
But what a 61-year-old engineer who has the title of a doctor of the American University in southern California really wants to save, in which the Egyptians don't even have a clear world.
Is the court supposed to be out of power?
234 paragraphs, which were soon approved by the head of the Constitutional Assembly with the advantage of Islamists in the 15th watch of the night marathon, are a partial cause of concern.
As in previous institutions, it is also said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principals" mean?
It was and is a matter of interpretation, and it can be feared that the Islamics use this vague formulation and the associated legal free space for a stricter interpretation of the Sharia.
At least this sheds light on the new paragraph: In all matters relating to Sharia, it is necessary to consult al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with a great influence on the whole of Sunni Islam.
It doesn't have to, but it can mean that the chlorine will be supervised by the law, which would bring justice to the actual exercise of sovereignty.
In the draft constitution there are many things of interpretation
The problem is also that the civil authority of the military courts should continue to be maintained.
These courts served as Mubara's government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
As proposed, it should also protect "the legal foundation of the Egyptian family and support its morals and values".
This is so clear from the legal page that by means of this paragraph, state institutions can even control the content of film art and literature.
In a understandable word, it means nothing but censorship.
No other paragraph in writing shall determine the explicit equality of men and women.
Therefore, another paragraph prohibits a Hanobit or slanders the prophet Mohammed and his envoys.
However, there is a lack of clarity as to what corruption is and how it will be achieved.
It is equally doubtful that the formulation is prohibited from "imposing people".
In this case, is the president's caricature enough or a joke on the law enforcement account?
The matter of interpretation, as many others in this proposal, which Mursi proposes to sign, and according to his words, he will present to the Egyptians "very soon" for the purpose of a public vote.
"The revolution has returned"
A few weeks have passed since opposition to the Islamic movement was formed.
Tens of thousands gathered on Friday evening at Tahrír Square in Kahir and pledged to destroy the constitutional bill before it began to pay.
"The revolution has returned and we win," said Hamdin Sabbáhi, who was in the third place in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Prize Carrier and former Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed Baradej, declared that the draft constitution belonged to "the trash of history".
By means of the short news service Twitter accused Mursí of wanting to carry out a "fight against democracy".
"If he makes a referendum, let's go to his palace and drop it," said the opposition member Jásir Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been punished," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition policy of Chalda Ali.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to look at the referendum, which would make it inappropriate.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim brotherhood issued a demonstration, but not in Tahrí Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile before the Kaahir University.
She was attended by many distraught women and supporters of the Salafists who called out: "People demand the application of the law of God."
They called out to Murse: "Make the earth clean," and they said: "The Qur'an is ours."
The struggle to overcome the symbolic siege of Tahrír, where it all began, would likely lead to a similar state of civil war.
Mursy's proponents obviously didn't want to risk it.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that the Protestants and the supporters of the constitution were loud and expressive.
Now is the time to let the people in the election hours decide which way the country should go.
Most of them are considered to be for the benefit of the Islamic proposal.
"The word 'lid law' doesn't exist at all"
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, celebrates the Hafize Abu Sa'du.
Eighty-four years human rights defenders and the president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison for Mubarak or standing before the court.
Not because he shared their ideology, but because human rights are inseparable for him.
He was beaten, sentenced, and imprisoned for that.
"And in the new constitution now there are no 'lid law' words at all," she complains in the interview for 'Welt am Sonntag'.
The Mursi extension of power to all three power components in the state has forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"In the place where the president strengthened civil society, he actually canceled it," complains Sa'da.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society's organization.
Sa'da also feels abandoned by the international community, which is monitoring the battle of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be an excuse for him.
The demonstration at Tahrír Square warns: "You have created a monster that you can't control anymore."
Norwegian Cancer: The World's Most Fascinating Fish?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the local appetite for extraordinarily fragrant fish?
Take a few mature cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football equipment.
Let it lie down for a week.
You'll get some paralysing smells of crustaceans, one of the biggest Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in the little town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's a snowy, beautiful view - and in the air there's an all-encompassing smell.
Rakfisk is a salty pear boiled in water for up to one year - depends on how much you want the fish to chew.
As she smiles and starts to be cold, the Norwegians here in Fagernes are beginning to meet at the festival dedicated to this, as they say the best, most subtle food.
"You make it raw and then drink a glass of water," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional fireman, but also called "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for the festival.
People around us eat small pieces of fish and drink them with a large amount of alcohol.
"Some people prefer to aqueduct more than cancer," says Havard.
The potion can break the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not that bad - it's a similar piece of sushi that was on a long way by bus.
Rakfisk is a very different product at a time when there was poverty in Norway, and since there were no icebergs yet, fish in the autumn flocked to the air - conditioning courts with water and salt.
Then in the middle of the winter, when they were well dried, pulled out, and ate, the meanings of alcohol no doubt drowned.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Nora were forced to leave their country and look for work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
At the present time, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% of immigrants form the attachment of large numbers of jobs, high benefits and large care systems.
The people of Sweden, the old rival, who had been far richer than Norway recently, are moving to the country for work.
It is seen as something important, irrefutable, even though the relatively inflammable part of the Norwegian past.
It's amongst the expensive food on the market.
Even though expensive is all - a small glass of beer or sandwich will take you out to 9 pounds (14 dollars) per piece.
Norway often fails to get to world news - and most people seem to do so.
The name Anderse Breivika, a right-wing racist extremist, who shot 77 men, women and children last year, is still mentioned here with contempt.
Instead, the shooting is called "the escape from July 22nd."
The Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
According to the current wealth of Norway, one of the largest oil and gas industries in the early 1970 ’ s is the growth of one of the world’s largest gas industries.
"But the oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," said Anna, who with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes represents a prototype of the Nordic welfare.
We're, like you're told, a lot of people are going to think.
Her English, as well as the English of most of the people here, is completely unique.
We don't pretend, we don't like the occasion.
Norway is very careful with its oil wealth - with the exception of a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund for the future generation.
When all the others in the years leading up to the global financial crisis were wasting money that they did not have, the Nors had a tight grip on their town.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and go on trips in summer, we're happy," Anna says.
"And eating cancer," he adds with an unannounced smile.
I'm standing in the snow in the front of something to eat - cancer is enough.
Such a bad burger is definitely something else and he's pretty neat.
But tonight, there's a burning fish here again.
The hotel in which I live is one of many places where cancer is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for their most demanding fish.
They have a connection to live TV transmission, in which the moderator is with the mollusk surrounded by the plates with the cancer.
It's like a singing Eurovision competition.
"What's your score for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our dot, Havard."
It's called relief and laughter.
A man will fall out of the chair, perhaps with an aquarium.
Or maybe all those fish evictions.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a hard start
As the upcoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Neto prepares to take over the office, he considers Will Grant from the BBC the challenges he is facing and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transportation in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In the city, which is trapped even in the best of times, steel barriers were created that closed several key routes into the main city and caused chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent those coming to work, but to prevent the protesting in approach to parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico Enrique Pena Neito will receive a presidential scarf and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a challenging task.
In Mexico during the time of the departure of Felipe Calderon, however, the country was in the war of drug war, which had already taken over 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment towards the Mexican people in reducing violence," President Pena Nieto told American President Barack Obama in the Oval work at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before he joined the U.S. president, President Pena Nieta gained political experience as governor of his home country of Mexico.
The views of the new leader are also different in his old homeland, a smooth and distant state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, they remember him in a good way.
The citizens attribute to it the development of tourism in aviation and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city after one of the new roads that made Pena Néto build. These roads are a huge improvement against the holes and ridges that were there before.
Boards with its name also hang on the walls of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum with a theme of climate change.
"We expect real and lasting change," said the friend and political associate Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state MP by President Pen Nieta, the institutionalised Revolution Party (PRI).
In particular, we look forward to interesting and real changes in the security and economy that our countries need so urgently.
After 81 years of uninterrupted power, the PRI party was expelled by Vicente Fox.
Ambassador Olver admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, many are expected to be inside of Enriqua Pena Nieta.
And he rejects the statement of opposition that characterizes the new president as a man without material content.
He's a very direct man, very busy with the excellent vision of the earth.
He's a great citizen, and he's mostly a man who can listen.
But on the other hand, this is not the impression that many people have of their former governor.
In Nezaalcoyotlu, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the long streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more obvious.
Congested under road crossings in many places, the suburb of Mexico is the main city itself.
And problems in the self-restraint village are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year, an army was called up to help with the handling of drug gangs operating in the quarters, especially the firearms are violence against women.
In the last two years alone, there have been huge bodies of dead women buried in an empty place.
In Mexico, more than 1,000 women were murdered when Pena Neito was governor, much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez, a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In a better case, Pena Nieta's criticism says that when she acted in the office, she failed to deal with the problem of the murder of women.
And in the worst case, his leadership blames him for closing his eyes.
In the concrete house, typical of the bustling neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me pictures of her dead daughter Mariana Luny and suppresses her crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
Her family, however, believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed as if her body were washed," recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were signs of strokes on him, and there's already been a death-insomnia.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross, on which is the only word: "Justice".
However, this is what the family says, exactly what they were denied.
The state authorities were treating me like I was an old rag, a troublemaker and a boner.
They want you to just accept what they say and shut up.
"But it can't be right when there's so many mistakes and reminders," he says.
Sherpa, who will receive President Pena Nieto on Saturday, is accompanied by a great deal of responsibility.
In the last six years, tens of dozens of families in Mexico have been hit by a violent crime and the new president has promised to be his priority after his office.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was the governor," said PRI Olver at Valle del Bravo.
But that's exactly what families in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about the wrong treatment, the military prosecutor said.
The military prosecutor is trying to get rid of Bradley Manning's claim regarding harsh treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants the case to be rejected on the basis of harsh treatment with Manning in prison.
The military is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that the soldier Bradley Manning, who is accused of the greatest leak of secret material in the history of the United States, has missed many opportunities to complain about the gross conduct he allegedly suffered in the military.
Military Prosecutor May. Ashden Fein at the cross-examination of the Manning Army at the preliminary hearing at Ft. Maede in Maryland claimed that the records of weekly visits that Manning had with the unit officials during the nine months of Quantica's imprisonment in Virginia show no complaints of maltreatment.
The cross-examination that occurred during the hearing of the defence proposal would reject the case brought against Manning for the sake of cruel treatment during a time of imprisonment which is itself sufficient to punish, took place on the day after Manning testified that he considered himself a suicide in the prison.
The military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents in his service in Iraq.
The material was then published online at WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday's hearing, military prosecutor Fein went through a form with Manning, which the officials completed after meeting Manning in Quantica Prison, where he was held in the regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him on Friday on these forms, Manning admitted that the treatment of his guards was "excellent" and the overall treatment in the device was "very professional".
The forms do not show any complaints of maltreatment, even though Manning's officers directly asked how they were treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that concerns about various problems had been voiced and that officials who visited him had talked to him about these concerns and indicated that they were going to deal with them, but these problems had not been identified.
"They wrote down "no problems" (after discussing concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain to his person in January 2011 at a meeting with the committee on suicide, which he expressed several months earlier in the form.
Manning replied that during this meeting it was his intention to achieve a reduction in the "prevention of injury" regime.
The army stated that it had used this restrictive regime (one degree under the supervision regime for the sake of suicide) for its protection and safety of others.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was okay and that I wanted to cancel this system of prevention of injury... so that I could enjoy the increased quality of life as I saw it," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transport to Kuwait, where he was held nearly two months before being transported to a prison on the basis of maritime traffic in Quantica in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he was considering suicide in Kuwait, and once he was there, for a reason, he fainted.
He stated that he was not allowed to know what would happen to him and what would happen to him in the surrounding world.
"My world just died on the Arifdjan base, on the club," Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Manning stated that after arriving in Quantica he spent most of the days (at least 21 hours, but often longer than 23 hours) in small goals without any company.
Manning said he was allowed only one mattress, cover, phone calls, some clothes and glasses.
He said he was trying to walk because sleep or bed was during the day against the rules.
Manning said he always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He stated that if the guards could not see his face when he turned on the other side of the night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's legal representative filed a formal complaint against the Manning Army in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked for the charges he filed in a Thursday statement concerning the fact that after having been forced to sleep one night for his purpose in Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other associations at the time of early reckoning.
Manning said he wasn't allowed to hide his cover when counting.
At a Friday hearing conducted by Judge Manning, he stated that by order of his guards, he had decided that he had a cover which he could hide, but he admitted that no one had issued a warrant for her postponement.
On Thursday Manning said he was forced to sleep naked last night because he tried to prove to the officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer he could use a belt from his underwear or his phone rings to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning said that the night he was removed from his cell his underwear, his phone rings and glasses.
His legal representative hopes that the judge will take into account his experience of his imprisonment and that in the case of his conviction before the military court, whose beginning is expected to begin next year, his punishment will be significantly reduced.
The defence stated that Manning is planning to admit himself to guilt in lower criminal offences and that he will fight against other charges because they are too extreme.
The start of the hearing is scheduled for this week, and the military prosecutor is expected to defend the conditions as legitimate.
The Pentagon stated that Manning was kept in accordance with the rules concerning all prisoners held in custody with a maximum alert.
The charges brought against Manning include the assistance of the enemy, the unlawful means of publishing information on the Internet, the transmission of information on national security and the theft of public property or records.
If he is accused at all points, he may be sentenced to life.
My crisis of Mexican-American identities
He says that many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the inadequate possibilities there are.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remember hard times, they say.
Navarrette says the Mexican Americans are greedy between the two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely broke up with the crowd and arrived in the area for the immigrant agenda, where I encountered a problem.
The strips pointed to one of the two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexican") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Citizens").
I stood there for a few seconds and I didn't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and I've been called "Mexican."
It's an ethnic shortness, the same as when my friends in Boston call themselves "Iry" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italy".
So later I ended up with the term "Mexico American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, it wasn't necessary to use shorts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
But I don't have the verbal resources of a native speaker, and I can't get rid of an American accent.
So I pulled out my American belt and set up a front for "Externanos."
I was thinking about the moment that this week, the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Neto visited the White House of President Obama.
The programme has the usual issues that are discussed when the leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Neto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why it is as likely that the Mexicans will remain in Mexico as they travel to the United States.
He wants to connect with the United States and Canada and create a business block similar to that of the European Union in North America.
And Pena Neito promised to continue in the Mexican war against drug cartels, although he did not provide any details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States attacked Mexico and forced its leader under the threat of weapons to transfer half of the Mexican territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans who think over the centuries, not a minute, the memories are everywhere.
So a minute after the United States representative says something a little critical about Mexico, you hear in the Mexican press and between the elite complaints about how Americans engage in the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And Montezumi's kids are going on a war track.
Yet, for Mexico, the real challenge is the relationship to more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people that the country offers opportunities, and others that it doesn't.
The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point of our family tree, there was a person, perhaps a parent, who was denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it would seem, this person matched the profile - dark skin, poor education, origin from poor village, etc.
We're their descendants and we're loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even if we're living American dreams now, going to good schools and having a good job, we can never forget that we're living American dreams, not Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
He's in front of the United States.
And yet we realize that many elite Mexicans in the ruling class don't like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and look at us as a sub-racial race that is not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our return to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence is, in their view, only a failure.
If our families didn't make it in Mexico, they'd never leave it.
And we're not going to be trapped in a soap oven, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and when she was legalized in the United States, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexicans, because Mexicans understand more who they are, and Mexican Americans don't like it.
Although he is a citizen of the United States, he sees himself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don't feel like part or part of it.
We love listening to Mexican groups, Los Tigers del Norte, but also Bruce Springstone.
You get the best of both countries, but you don't even have roots in one.
He's looking at us in Mexico like the Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And to make relationships even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligence, as I learned on my trip, want to re-connect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "provisional ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great it is to visit this country and press the political leader to establish relations with Mexico.
No, no, no.
That's not going to happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to the inequality of income and the widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that it is a great country.
I feel like it's on you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States how they dealt with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still do not feel the way their family members were dealt with in a much closer past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could still be an unreal basis for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews on the Middle East?
Another blood flow cycle indicates that every such event is useless.
Among the usual unnecessary rumors about who started it, many buildings were turned into riots, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most civilians, and six Israelis. First, rockets from Gaza hit near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to have stuck in their old conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, are trapped in the resulting chaos in the region.
Maybe it causes their fight to be even more bloody than ever.
However, there is reason to believe that it can disrupt their mortal Pata’s situation.
A war that is neither saved nor lost.
At first glance, there seems to be little reason for optimism at the present time.
Even if the ceasefire closed on November 21st lasted, the fights of this week strengthened the mine on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement ruling in Gaza since 2007, will argue that they have forced the Israelites to resign, even though Gaza suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several leaders of Hamas and the closure of 1.7 million people in Gaza in one of the worst and worst corners of the planet, Hamas did not succeed in destroying Israel.
And in fact, Hamas has an influence on the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by its fallen rivals from Fatah, the more moderately Palestinian fraction.
In addition, the leaders of Hamas can very well conclude that time is on their side.
Islamists all over the Arab world gained greater influence, so Hamas won powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, the revitalized regional power, once the closest Muslim alliance of Israel, joined Hamas. Likewise, Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Proud Hamas people say that the Islamic half-month is surrounded by Israel, north of Lebanon, where the ruling party/military Hizballah, across Syria, where rebels, who are still more inclined to Islam, can sit under Bashar Asada, until after Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And above all, on the southern wing of Israel, the rise of the Muslim brotherhood under the leadership of President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, far from the southernmost and narrowest Arab country, has changed the region.
Husni Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is the brother of Hamas and its leaders are more influential in public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may appear as a player who cannot be excluded either by Israel or by America.
On the contrary, the hard lines of Israel will come to the opposite conclusions.
Hamas was put back in the military terminology.
The Israeli anti-fraud system The Iron Cup proved its price and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelites can sleep better for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as unbeatable as ever. Many European countries are also vinyl Hamas from the beginning of the last round of violence.
And mainly - Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahua, the president of the government, which the peace process largely ignored.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been relatively calm against suicide bombings, from the part of the wall that has occupied the West Bank, the main part of what the Palestinian state may once be, and protects Jewish settlements that are still growing despite its illegality against international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose side Likud initially joined the 22nd January election with even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.
Why should we blame those treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled on the West Bank, wouldn't they fire missiles like their countrymen in Gaza?
It'll be better if we keep them behind that wall and beat them when they shake their heads.
Perhaps hard lines will win, but the Arab Spring can change their prospects.
Although Islamists who gain power in Egypt and in other lands do not have too much in love, their primary priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel’s defence expenditure is higher than that of all its four Arab neighbours together.
The launch of a new war with local superpowers will hardly help the new Arab government heal its economy.
The fact that President Mursí worked with President Barack Obama to get a fire stop is a good sign and can mean the beginning of something new.
The Israelites too should look at the situation from a long - term perspective.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, it creates opposition to the Palestinians' right to self-determination with the shooting work that must one day explode in the areas occupied by Israel - just like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Already, repression in the Jewish state of democracy and demographics are weakening this situation as the Arab population grows.
Bloody disasters against Gaza, occurring every few years for the purpose of pressing Hamas, will continue to be the subject of a higher rate of diplomatic tax.
Both sides need a boost outside.
The answer is what reasonable people say on both sides, most of the outside world and these newspapers: two states where Israel will spread security territory.
In the short term, there is little hope that stopping the fire will give the pressure from the outside at least a little more influence on the release of this thing.
Egypt, which together with Turkey and Qatar must establish a stop to arms supplies to Gaza, has a better position than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
The Arabians must also press for a match between Hamas and Fatah.
This would have done more to create a Palestinian state than the immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty in the United Nations.
President Obama also has his part in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first election period, he ignored the presentation of his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems to be equally talented in his entry into the process.
That's a sadly short-sighted thing.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the laws on dirty cigarette packaging entered into force
There are warnings for smokers and the sick parts of the body on non-respected green boxes that are the same for all tobacco brands.
The Australian laws on the harsh packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of their species in the world, and the logos and colors replaced the traditional olive green boxes with vivid images of the sick parts of the body and the display of children and newborns who were ill with the consequences of their parents ’ smoking.
In addition to various health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the boxes is the name of the label printed in the same small letter on Saturday.
This is the strictest regime in the world for packaging tobacco.
The Australian federal government claims that the aim of getting young people out of smoking is to eliminate this abuse from its appeal.
It depends on a study that shows that if people don't start smoking at the age of 26, it's 99% chance that they will never start smoking.
"Even in very small children, you can see that they understand the message tobacco companies are trying to sell together with their product," says the Federal Ministry of Health Tanya Plibersek and quotes studies that have shown, for example, that children are joining a crown in a window with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest number of smokers in the world and changes will only have a minor impact on the profits of transnational companies, other countries consider introducing similar measures.
The tobacco industry has been hardboggling against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies claimed that this law would increase trade in the black market, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"Thanks to this legislation, there are serious inconceivable consequences," says Scott McIntyre from British American Tobacco Australia.
Fading from China and Indonesia will bring a lot more of these products that will be sold on Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws have increased their trades.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for cigarettes packages from silicone used to cover disgusting boxes, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco had lost their withdrawals from Australian Supreme Court laws, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha stated that Zico had sold nearly 6,000 pieces to wholesalers and was expecting new supplies.
It's a good deal for us.
As possible, experts indicate the popularity of social media in the demographic group on which the plan is focused.
Throughout a number of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsoring sports events and demanding that most sellers hide cigarettes in front of direct view, tobacco marketing moved online.
Australia has banned online advertising by local companies and websites, but it cannot limit foreign websites.
"If you are a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you are left with only this small space for the promotion of your products, online space is an insurmountable place for you to be," says Becky Freeman, a research worker in the field of public health at the University of Sydney.
Mrs. Freeman recorded an increase in the rating of social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, performed by "average Honzo".
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and gave yourself a job and created this video, or is it a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the sector has focused on how it imposes new regulations rather than marketing.
The sector has gone so far that it has paid Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for attacks on new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organisation declare that trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia significantly trades.
The adoption of the SOO Decision is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says that the government has been conducting discussions with other governments that consider similar laws regarding packages.
Canada was the first country to take mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
Now more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine, have expanded.
More stringent laws are being considered by the United Kingdom, New Zealand, the South African Republic and India.
A lot of smokers in Australia are fighting.
The images have no effect on me.
I just ignore them.
"Just pull out the cigarette and pull the box back," says Victor El Hage when he buys a box with a picture of the tumor in his mouth.
Honestly, it's just one reason I quit smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack in the centre of Sydney, claims that thanks to the single boxes, it is harder for him to balance it with the rules.
"It took me an hour, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we'd say, "Okay, that's the end, we'll close the store," he said and decided with his hands.
It's not so bad to be bored in the world of uncontaminated connections
The last day of Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So we had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Waiting a half day at the airport for another flight is quite annoying, even through the dispersal of books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts on child development are becoming increasingly bored.
They say it's good for us (and our children) to get bored at times.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can support creation.
And since most of us are constantly attached to a screen today, we have no chance of enjoying it.
So should we support nude?
Yes.
Oh, no.
But I'll be back.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon that came with more leisure time.
But as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University of Calgary, who is the author of the book Boredom: A Lively History (History nudy) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom has a long history," he said.
On the walls in Pompeii was found a Latin inscription regarding nudes, originating in the first century of our summer.
And then there's also a question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it was defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After looking at the research literature and presenting the idea of the target group, about 100 people in Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I wasn't able to do it."
Nudity differs from apathy because a person is not involved in anything, but she wants to be.
He says there's no need to do anything about the apathy.
He says that the core of nude is "a disruption of the process of attention linked to the bad mood and the sense of slow running time."
Nausea can be a great reminder of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have a relationship, people tend to see a problem like the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see a problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when we're just having trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in September in Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to a previous experiment, where participants listened to a tape on which the person read the article from the magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they could hardly notice it, while the third group did not even hear it.
Those who heard the TV program quietly said more boredom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but they were not sure why and attributed these difficulties to boredom.
If you are trying to focus on a difficult or challenging task, a violation of attention may lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, "what it's like looking for bad parts on the factory line, it can be an exciting music to help you not to be bored."
In fact, he said, now we know that bending and piercing, which is often viewed as a sign of boredom, can actually help to fight boredom and keep people physically more attentive.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to go around will learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit quietly," said Professor Fenske.
We've all been bored at times -- the delay of my flight, the sounder, especially the long film.
But some individuals are more likely to get bored than others.
In order to help measure boredom, scientists in the 1980s developed the "Bordom Proneness Scale" (Bordom Proneness Scale).
The stairs include questions such as: "Many things I have to do, repeat and are monotonous," and "I'm so interested that I don't have time to do them all."
With these steps, scientists have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and especially when it comes to needing more and different external stimulation.
Teenagers, however, are generally absent.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 per cent of the adolescents reported being bored at school and doing homework, while 23 per cent reported being bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he doesn't know if the percentage of nausea would be now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
He said, however, that he knows that "growth is the ultimate time for boredom", which is largely due to the fact that children and young people are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question, "Is it boring for you?"
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to face absurd physical risks, gambling, or abuse of conventional substances as a way to mitigate them.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Now there's a way to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the best thing you should do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cooking, it will make you happy.
However, if you watch TV, it will make you happy only for a moment, not for a long time.
So if your child is bored and you give him the iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't learn how to play himself or drive on his own, Professor Fenske said.
And "this separate procedure is transferred from one situation to another," said the professor.
Your child will not only learn how to enjoy himself, but he will gain greater self - control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't even be too critical of her.
Our goal should be to feel more comfortable when we have a constant breakdown of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We blame her for the need to get bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be connected with something meaningful," he said.
What people are actually looking for, he said is a way to relax and enjoy free time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulating," he said, "it's hard to find ways to have fun when the noise turns off."
There is no manual on the new marijuana law in Colorado.
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a student at a high school and a footballer from South Eastern Colorado, faces a charge of criminal acts for something that will soon be legal in the whole state - for holding several grams of marijuana and smoke used for its smoking.
Mr. Orozco said that one January day he went with a few friends in Lamar, on the plains near the border with Kansas when he was stopped.
After the police found in a marijuana car, Mr. Orozco was given a call for drug possession and equipment for the use of drugs - small offenses, in which there is a penalty of $100 - and the date of the trial was set.
"They treated us like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But he's a criminal?
In the last few weeks after the colorad vote on the legalisation of a small amount of marijuana for recreational use, hundreds of responses to smaller drug cases depend more on the place than on the law.
Hundreds of cases of violations of marijuana detention have already been brought here and in the state of Washington, which has approved similar measures, has been abolished.
The police department ceased to accuse adults aged 21 and older for holding a small quantity, which will be legally allowed after the law enters into force in the coming weeks.
But the plaintiffs in the more conservative territories of Colorado have declared that they will continue with existing cases of marijuana, and they still accuse people of detention.
At the same time, several cities from the suburb of Denver, towards the western mountains, vote to prevent the opening of new, state licensed shops with marijuana in their villages.
"This issue is developing so quickly that I don't know what's going to happen," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
The heads are shaking and the regulators in Washington State.
And they are looking for guidance on how to set up a system of licences for growth, production, distribution and sale - all by December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado, whether in good or bad, is in front of most states in marijuana, first for medical use and now for recreation.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the licensing of the state of Washington.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than propose what might work.
"There is no real precedent that we could drive," he said.
Washington law, I-502, has effect on 6 December, which also leaves an annual vacuum, during which there will not yet be a state licensing system, but legal holding yes.
And there are identified mechanical issues that have to be resolved during this period, for example, how to implement the State Directive on "appropriate approach" to licensed marijuana with its prohibition of trade in a rope up to 330 metres from schools, parks, children's playgrounds or children's centres.
"There will be no more difficulty in placing a licensed trade with a rope than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson of the Centre for Legal Coupons, a recently established research group.
On November 21st, police chief Oates sent his e-mail to his officers from Aurora, informing them that the city prosecutor will no longer be indicted for holding a small quantity of marijuana in every citizen aged 21 and that the police "with immediate validity" will stop accusing people of these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police would promote city laws governing drug addicts and continue to reach drug dealers and dealers.
In the period Weld in North Colorado, the periodic prosecutor Ken Buck represents a stronger view.
After the vote, he announced that his office would continue in the process of maintaining marijuana, mostly as a way to press the user to seek treatment.
At present, there are 56 grams or less marijuana indictees of 119 people, although many of them face further charges.
"Our office is obliged to commit a criminal offence, which was a criminal offence at the time it occurred," Mr. Buck stated in his statement.
The response was also complicated in places such as the rural Mesa period, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the period, no longer blames adults for holding a small amount.
The District Prosecutor, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided not to refuse all ongoing detention cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing to promote law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of the colorad wishes supported measures, the introduction of recreational marijuana into the government's hands and the legal system will never be easy.
And the counterproductive reaction across the country has revealed a deep dissatisfaction between local officials in view of this large state green experiment.
For periodic prosecutors, it is a "cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents accused of holding marijuana, and local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of marijuana Laws.
"They spent so much of their lives reaching people that they still couldn't really accept that it was legal," he said.
As the first states that make small quantities of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the best way to become national testing cases for drug law.
Guardians and state authorities are planning new frontiers for legalised sales and are also looking forward to the federal government's guidelines, which are still planned to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The legalization advocates of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will be subjugated.
Despite several arrests by marijuana sellers for medical purposes and patients who use it, which attracted attention, the federal government left most of the trades with a medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and other 16 states in operation.
While anti-drug agents are probably not going to knock out the door to catch a small drug bag, it is likely that they will support the possibility of state-controlled trades with recreational marijuana permitted by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, former adviser to President Obama's anti-drug policy.
A number of colorful cities are not waiting for the federal authorities' procedure.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved moratorium on any new marijuana trade, even if it would take about a year before any trade can be opened.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a half-year ban and is likely to enter into force next week.
"We don't want to be in a situation where we're giving someone a license and then we're going to have a big federal issue," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our pledge voted against this addition.
We're looking at what she voted for, against what she voted for.
There's really a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I'm a conservative."
In their opinion, today's university students are not the only ones attacked.
I don't remember ever having a study at the University of Oxford.
Like my father, my older brother was studying at the university, which I thought was the world's largest thirst for knowledge, a modern-day venison Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And so far, at the end of the 1980s, I was in the middle of the 20th century two weeks after going to Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, pack up my suitcases, and get into the first scandal of my life.
My father fell apart and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I gave it up because I had objections to the love of the students in the next room.
Author A. N. Wilson said I'm gone because I've been forced to drink out of my mind.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was the subject of systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my kind of bizarre name or the fact that I came from private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this collaborator of the supposed enlightenment it was both great and barbaric: my father, the deceased Woodrow Wyatt, was highly appointed counsellor Margaret Thatcher and I am a member of the Conservative Party.
You can ask why I'm pulling it out right now.
Just because the latest reports indicate that a new generation of students suffers from a similar follow-up on Wednesday.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so great that last week, a group of these students sought the same protection of equal rights as gay people, persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Youth Association (JCR) at Corpus Christi College claim that because of their political views they are "frequently isolated, exposed to personal attacks and given that they are not welcome".
They demand the creation of a position in the University Committee on Equal Opportunities, which would ensure that their opinions can be made free of charge.
Their situation did not even help the recently mentioned documentary show BBC Two entitled Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right about the student's political act, which the conservative cured as wonder and non-unionist.
In the series, the graduate Joe Cooke, former president of Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA) who drove Rolls-Royce, was dressed in silver clothes and had a helmet with a silver head.
In other high schools, conservative students say that they are treated as "victims".
Twenty-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President Nottingham University Conservative Association, told the Sunday newspaper that "lively influence on universities is growing.
People think we're like Bullingdon Club without even meeting with us."
One-year history student at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who stands ready for greater protection, says that such a climate is "unfriendly", while a 19-year-old elected president of OUCA Stephanie Cherill says that in the approach of JCR members, the right of people from Wednesday came to an aggravation.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to the good living conditions of members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I arrived in September 1986, when I was 18 years old and in a humiliating way.
The hatred for the Conservative side was the worst.
About a year ago, the university voted against the refusal to grant an honorary title to former student Margaret Thatcher for the sake of the gaps in the funding of higher education.
From the atmosphere, the Stalinists would also be afraid of glory.
During the first few days of the opening week, when new students met with each other and with teachers, I got to taste the pool I was supposed to come to.
I found out that not only do the professors of silence approve the preservation of conservative students, but they also share in it with pleasure.
A policy of mountain status, privatisation and government resistance to sanctions against apartheid in the South African Republic has been introduced into the woodwork.
My first lecture was on the translation of the French text from the 18th century into English and what followed was not prepared for me.
"Ms. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now dead), "please put in the first paragraph."
I'm tired of it.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like a cake cake, was very yellow.
"Thatcherovs refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students moved.
I've had tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your leisure time, so if you are not too busy with social matters," said Professor Pitt.
I went back to my room.
At dinner at school, I sat on my own when I felt a slight stabbing on my shoulder.
He was a second-year-old student named James who represented himself as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said.
I'm afraid so.
Anyone who's suspected of conservativeism is a bully.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most conservatives pretend to be laborists.
Later in the local hospital, I tried to pretend.
I was insisting that I disagree with everything that Thatcher said.
This trick turned out to be a failure.
A student of the first year of the field of philosophy, politics and economy who (as irony) went to Eton said: "You are a daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
Other students took notes with him.
I was crazy, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" one asked.
They're beating each other, right?
I felt like they had to feel gay before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet with people who think in a similar way only after a seven - hour period?
Would I have to change into a laborer and push my natural shelters?
Three years before me, they developed into a clean-up of ignorance and isolation.
The only open conservative professor was Norman Stone, professor of modern history who lived in my college.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher's advisor to foreign policy and one of those who wrote her speeches.
He was almost there.
This place hated for his province and for his attachment to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he went to the place of professor at Bilkent University in Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started coming from Oxford to my parents' house in London, looking for shelter with my unscrupulous metropolitan friends and families.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
All political opinions were accepted during his study at Oxford in the 1940s.
"But it's the best place in the world," said pathetically.
They wouldn't, not in the city of dreams.
Even my communist friends always had perfect ways.
His eyelids have been dulled.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
The frequent trips to London made my emotional stamina worse.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, was under pressure and gave up his conviction.
The following week, during the course of the course, when another professor of history said quite seriously that I am "enemies of the people", I decided to do the same.
Even though I was getting a cold red inside, I confessed to having my "parents brushed my brain" and called them "old lunatics."
The left was only short-lived.
My Oxford career was locked up by my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns every week to Murdoch's news.
My door was locked.
I crashed inside, and after five minutes, my persecutors gave it up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a sickly weak man.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be the subject of such fear and resentment in the educational institution.
However, it is even more tragic that Oxford was not only the 14 conservative prime ministers, but also the undeserved reputation of the place with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino has better elegance than fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Fashion Creation", which was launched this week in London, ABC spoke to Natya Abascalov, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the old-fashioned residence of Isabely I. English, is the only place in the British capital, a great guest of the exhibition Valentina Garavaniho.
The designer confirmed this at the beginning of the famous retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashion Creation", which represents more than 130 models of top fashion created by his studio in the last 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says to his irreplaceable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il Signore" Garavani is the only protagonist who could not have been written without his honored client.
Valentino always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world of aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which lasts until 3 March, recycles private correspondence and photographs with signatures of the most important cults, from Princess Salima Aga Chán through the Greek Princess Marie-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino presents these personal memories as the trophies of his social retreat: from the simple Croatian town of Vogher in northern Italy to the icon of the international "Bohemian trash".
It's not bad to like the royal family.
"They don't at least burn a bad cigarette in a great blanket, like some wonderful pop-music celebrities do," says Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps, and we were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and guests have a great deal of fun and elegance.
"All of us were very pleased when we were invited to his chat at Gstaad," explains ex-wife "Heini" Thyssen and close friends of forgotten beauty such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino always had better elegance than fame.
And yet there's a star from him."
Valeria Mazzová plays Valentina
The designer's charisma doesn't even forget the Argentine model Valeria Mazova.
"It's been many years since we went to him for dinner after a visit to Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were twenty of us, and between us, Sharon Stone and John Kennedy were younger.
In every detail of his apartment, his glory, his food, his music, he was in everything, and he felt his spirit.
All the calls made him feel important and loving," recalls the top model that began working with him during the Paris Week of Top Fashion in 1995.
"He will never get out of fashion, because his designs are artistic works," he says.
Preservation of fertility
The grave's life is not a story of possession, but of truly repeated love.
He loves people with good education and better titles and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House was built to a special 70-metre long pass that offers a change of role: a visitor turns to the model and walks to observe the "observation" of dreams that Valentine's masterpieces like dresses that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, a costume that had Monica Vitti in "Nice", or a coat of wool and leather that belonged to Emperor Farah Diba's.
In the audience, the manikinek is known as Sibilla Lucemburská, Gloria from Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit Norská, Rosario Bulharská or Sophie Habsburská.
Naty Abascal and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say the first Valentine is like the first love, "we can't forget him."
"I remember it perfectly.
They were pants, shirts, vests "gillette" and jackets from the autumn-winter collection from 1971 to 1972.
It was a gift he made for me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designers.
"I give him in front of others the privilege of his feminineness and great love for women because he inspires our beauty," adds the former Duke of Feria.
"I like the colors that I use, they make a lot of sense and they give me the "light" face.
Proportions are perfect."
No princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can forget how Valentina dressed first.
When she was growing up and living in Italy, she wanted to be full - age and have an opportunity to dress one of his evening dresses...
She finally reached the end of the 1990s.
"I bought my first dress from Valentine for the occasion of a celebration in the palace of my cousin, Prince Edward de Ligne.
They were red dresses that had skirts with calls, scarfed life and tops without shoulders.
It was a dream that became a reality," says the widow after Rodrigue d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is lax for fashion, his passion is overtime," explains an Italian aristocrat whose life takes place between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has stored designer dress "very careful... because dresses are not just dresses, it's also a file of memories they have in them."
"King" Mode
The Golden Cemetery at Somerset House are Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dresses from her wedding with Paul Greek in 1995.
To create these silk garments of ivory color with all the pearls, twelve types of different corners and a stretch of four and a half meters long, it took four months of work and 25 "college" (as called the designer of his scarves).
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the largest authority of the specialized press, these dresses represent the top fashion border of the late 20th century, "return customers from high company".
Valentino, who was awarded an elite "savoir-être" over the years, is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and awarded by the Order of Honorary Legie gathers as many honors as any of his clients' husbands.
"My attention has always attracted his choice, peace, adjusted and perfect view," admits Princess d'Arenberg.
"The last time I saw him was a month ago for a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my big girlfriend.
He was useless, time on him left no trace."
When the princess says...
The strongest handle in the world: cheese carriers in the area of Kawah Ijen
In four euros, they gamblers in the area of Indonesian soup with their lives and health, carrying 70 kilos of cheese down the steep rocky trails.
They're people whose work is hell, and they're the ones who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anta Wijayi, one of 400 miners who earn their living by obtaining cheese from the Kawah Ien soup on the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
That's why every day the fahrate has to go to the bottom of the crater, where the raw gases are avoided from the inside of the Earth and when the air is in contact with it, it goes to a steady state.
After cutting large blocks of cheese, which together weighs up to 70 kilograms, it refers to the shoulder in two bamboo baskets along the surface of the stone paths.
To the top of the soup, which is 2,386 meters, it is only 250 meters, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes before they rise at the speed of the gel up, because they keep balance and carefully consider their steps so that they do not slip and fall into ruin.
They know that any misunderstanding could be a life like that of a French tourist who fell off the Kawah Ijen scale years ago.
Mountainers in Kawah Ien make five cents for every kilo of cheese that they carry
When they are upstairs, they travel around tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in the circus, and they tirelessly refer heavy baskets to the vase that the bottom company placed about something below, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
This is the company PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been in the soup since 1960 and has never paid his employees more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilogram of cheese.
It then sells 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this disorder has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of lighters, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even white sugar.
"Because it usually weighs 70 pounds, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3,8 euros) each way," explains Anto, who usually graduates three trips daily.
One journey takes him three hours and eventually it is destroyed, but it can earn 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Even though it appears to be a negligible amount for such a non-indigenous effort, it's a triple of what he would make on the field.
"The daily wages of the miners are very high here. For example, the collection of coffee is worth 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros) per day and the payment for fourteen days is two million rupees (167)," explains the carrier who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a farmer.
There was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the bush, for a serious reason that is as convincing in Indonesia as cheese: "I married a young girl from Bali who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam."
And he's got asthma, he's breathing badly, he's still coughing, and his eyes are poisoned by toxic gases.
In his 27 years Anto three times a day risking his life in Kawah Ijen’s soup, whose cheese has already begun to choose his tax, although his face is protected by a special mask and glasses.
He's got asthma, he's breathing badly, he's still coughing, and his eyes are poisoned by toxic gases that avoid the fungus.
That's the price he has to pay for reaching his dream.
"I will be working for two more years because I want to open my shop or study Spanish or French," he promises more than the existing English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man who has arrived in the fate could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a receptionist at the hotel, and instead, he does the work of the carrier.
It shares a dirty wooden block with other wearers and every day rises in two hours in the morning, because the cheese at night does not cease to grow and its characteristic yellow color changes in blue and September darkness.
Even in the surrounding darkness, Anto goes to the crater and lights up the path of a small light that he has tied to a helmet and bought it for his own money.
Approximately 400 bearers carry on a shoulder basket with cheese from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has a high income, the demand for cheese for cost savings has not mesmerized, nor does it provide any equipment to workers working on their own crops and with such effort.
In fact, they do not even receive a share of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) from the photographing supplement, which, together with an entrance for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), select the visitors from the natural park who come to take pictures of the sop and its human mollusk.
"This work is for the gain, not for the people," says Madrusin, a 42-year-old resident who has been working in Kawah Ien for three decades since he left school.
He can raise up to 110 pounds and assures us that he will continue to work "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retirement, I'm going to die here because the soup was my whole life.
Although the cheese burns the throat and fists in the eyes, when the wind suddenly turns and catches the horn in thick tails that come out of the trunks, the horns are so claimed that none of them complains that they suffer from serious diseases... it is obvious, however, from their frequent respiratory difficulties, arthrosis, knee pain and wound on the shoulder caused by the waves of the baskets.
The one who weighs his basket on his back can load only 50 pounds in his 53 years.
Every day he and his colleagues remove 15 tons of cheese in the soup, which then the three trucks take off the steep road between the cottages in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the soup was my whole life," says Unainik and opens up a wide mouth where several teeth are missing.
Of his five sons, the oldest, 30 years old, he also earns from smelting cheese.
The time of the gas, but the constant beat of one of the most difficult crafts in the world survives from generation to generation - crafts that perform human mulch in Kawah Ilen.
Singapore is looking for a baby to save the economy
The Singaporeans argue that they have no children, no career, no stress and no cost of living and education.
"The population of Singapore needs growth."
I'm married and I'm the owner, you're my wife and you're the owner.
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of advertising on Mental Bonbons, but - or perhaps because of that - the video started this year in Singapore with a massive spread on YouTube.
These words are part of the rap, which uses local attacks of the type "let's buchto to the trumpet" as a smile of the birth rate in Singapore.
The BBH advertising agency, which created the video, hopes that it will be able to alert them in a funny way.
The artistic director of the Douglas Hamilton agency says he wanted to use the influence of music to make people fulfil their "civil duty".
"It was about the Internet, so it must have been fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we should have felt that this is the subject that we need to touch.
We knew the government was trying a lot of things like expanding perfumes with pheromones or organizing a dating party.
Many of these ideas could have been more creative, but not quite functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing possible, like a rape compound, to solve this problem."
1.2 children
Whoever doesn't take it very seriously is a Singaporen government.
He spends $1,300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and grants financial contributions.
But all these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a rich city state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known as the conservative of its representatives and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore with regard to population classification is currently 1.2 children per woman.
Lastly, she exceeded the birth rate of 2, which is considered to be the rate of renewal, in 1976.
Why do the Singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Committee on Marriage and Family of the National Population Office, says it is because of "better education" and "wider scale of career opportunities".
"People thus have a wider range of options, with regard to life's goals and priorities, it's not just marriage and family," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of free people and to the decommissioning of marriages and child rearing, resulting in a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
While there has been a drastic effort in immigration policy to increase the rate of immigrants as a measure against the decline in the number of people, this has caused insecurity among locals.
On some Singapore websites, unscrupulous xenophobia is seen against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticised for maintaining low wages and a small effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore's government has recorded its worst election result from the beginning of independence last year.
After the elections, efforts were made to resolve the problem by means of quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decrease in birth rates has known effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, health and immigration policy, in Singapore, there have also been some unexpected consequences.
The government's trying not to get so many small houses.
For example, she began to influence real estate trade.
The City Development Office has begun to regulate the number of small apartments known as "Bot Boxes", which can be built in certain urban areas.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have great success in sales.
However, there is concern that these apartments can support the youthful lifestyle and reflect the development of large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the EL Developers company, claims that their "botboxes" are sold far faster than houses.
"They're more popular, and so they sell for days to weeks faster than houses with a larger spread.
That's why our cash flow is much better."
However, it would admit that the new standards set out clearer rules for developers who were previously limited when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Although these new rules could lead to an increase in the birth rate of the nation, the interview with Singapore's employees in the financial quarter in the city centre indicates that they will not have much effect.
"People are still under stress, homes are expensive, just like education, so many people are putting off," says the young official.
"The rest of them have children.
But it's important for me to rely on my own money and time," says another, about 20 years old, young man.
Men and women refer to careers, stress and the cost of living and education as the reasons why they are forbidden to have children.
So whatever the government is trying to force citizens to have children, it's also the end of Singapore that has the last word of the family.
What is private offline is private and online
Private.
According to a dictionary issued by the Royal Spanish Academy, it is about something that has a personal character or "the area of private life which has every right to protect against any violation".
What is privacy for a person 16 years of age?
How does this definition apply in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the danger he is exposed to when he publishes on the Internet things he certainly would not tell anyone in regular communication?
Newspapers from ElPeriodic spoke to five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy as "something entirely own" in the personal level and as "user name and password" if it was a social network.
"My greatest secret I would not disclose," says ten-year-old Jorge in an effort to explain the importance of privacy in places such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"It's a very secret secret, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world," she says.
"I'm giving the FB nice pictures or pictures of how we play.
I'm also talking to my acquaintances.
I would not share a picture that would not be mine, or a picture that would make someone laugh," he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscenity photos, photographs of naked persons or photographs of crimes, or to write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on the FB and his nine supporters on Twitter.
Most of them are related.
There's a mother among them who has a name and a password from one of the accounts.
"I set up a Twitter account so that I could express my views and write interesting comments.
I don't know if anyone's gonna answer me, I'm just putting them there," she adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or fast communicating with friends," he says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teen own accounts on the Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask networks and the last mentioned network will admit that he doesn't know 20 people from his list of friends.
"I'm not afraid because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them put him on anything or wanted an address or phone number after him.
"If they forced me or demanded it from me, it would be easy to remove it from their account," he admits.
José applied to Ask after reading his recommendation on Twitter.
Tomuto boys are not foreign experiences with what is today called cyberbulying.
"A friend known to be on social networks has been blackmailed.
They threatened him and asked for money.
He never knew who it was," he confirms.
According to José, the victim didn't report it.
"You just activated your private regime."
Then she explains a series of steps on how to set the account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would publish photos of people in unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I'd do it if someone was bothering me or just wanted me to.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying," he claims.
Key issues
Marielos Porrasová, an English teacher and graduate of the field of Výchý and education, believes that children and adolescents in social networks need to understand that the main purpose of these networks is to inform them.
He says: "The Internet was created as a means of seeking information, but when a social network appeared, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic worker Marc Prensky, graduate of pedagogy at Yale University and author of the article Digital Natives and Digital Movers, introduced these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who need to teach them, and then we are only learning ourselves," he says.
He explains that it is a complex topic, "because we ask them to know what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what is not, at the age when they are not mature enough to do so."
Also, to be - as far as the environment is concerned - balanced, at the time when it is most desirable to be popular, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences," he adds.
According to this expert, it is the most effective way to show children and teenagers what it is to ask questions that they need to think about.
"Tell them not to do anything, it doesn't work," he says.
Furthermore, Marrielos Porras has named some of the options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing this online?
Or: Would you like someone to publish your photo the way you published your friend?
Do you know what others are publishing about you?
When you're marking people on the party photos, did you ask these people for permission?
And one more: Does everyone need to know what you're doing all the time?
The next point is to realize that they have to behave in the Internet as well as outside the Internet.
They're the same rules.
"A person is guided by respect, moral and other principles outside the internet and should be on social networks," he says.
Monitoring
Esturdo Guardia, a university professor, a teacher at first level and an educational advisor explains that it is necessary for parents to read the rules on social networks carefully.
"If they understand everyone's privacy, they have a good basis for talking to their children about the consequences that an online account can have.
For example, about age or what is allowed to be shared or published," he says.
The Guard is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule "not to talk to strangers".
Summit South America ends and the Lima Declaration has not been published
The sixth Presidency of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru today ended without the issue of the Lima Declaration, which was announced and which was reportedly signed by the seven current presidents.
The Efe Agency has repeatedly tried to gain access to a document signed at the sixth meeting of the Head of State and Government of Unasur, but representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who have initially established that the document will be published at the end of the summit, have stated that it will be published later on the Peruvian Government's website.
They further stated that the content was published by Peruvian President Ollanto Humalu in several short press statements.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the discussion, video from the Presidential Assembly was broadcast in the press room without a sound with a report "confidential session, audio transmission banned".
A small amount of information available to journalists was provided by the press speakers of some governments who were present rather than by Peruvian speakers.
The only document published during the discussion was a list of participants with the presidents, which caused hundreds of journalists from different national and international media to be denied more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent an e-mail with a "final declaration" from the summit, but it is only about President Humaly's statement, not about the official document that the summit closed.
Last October, Peru's third summit in South American and Arab countries (America del Sur-Países Arabes, ASPA) was not originally promised, even though it was demanded by the press.
The official pages of ASPA can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities insisted on ensuring that all journalists were sent, but they completely blocked the information.
The Summit concluded, inter alia, with Chile and Peru's joint commitment to the Hague Court of Justice ruling, which deals with the border dispute between the two countries.
President of Peru Ollanta Humala and President of Chile Sebastian Piñar met at the regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will begin on Monday with the hearing of both parties in the defence of the dispute that started Lima against Santiag.
"We will take action and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute that we are discussing at this international court today," said President Humala with his Chilean opponent.
"Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, a peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international courts," Piñar added and greeted President Humal with a shake of hands on the trains of both countries.
The two presidents confirmed that the scope of the International Court of Justice decision was published after Colombia adopted the Bogotá Pact this week, expressing the details of the international court rulings that it had decided on maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered this decision to be totally wrong.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chavez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was excluded from the Unasur organization in 2011 following the resignation of then President Fernanda Luga and did not attend the meeting.
The hosting president, Ollanta Humala, was entrusted with the start of the early talks and the conclusion of the summit in Lima shortly after the afternoon.
The President read a final document informing us that 16 agreements were adopted and that 31 projects were planned between South American countries, with an investment of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, the UNASUR member countries will take "significant steps towards a goal in the form of a South American citizenship for which residence agreements are extended".
He reported that actions are supported to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and international organised crime, to improve the availability of medicines and cheap internet in all parts of South America and to joint and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters".
When Europe is in crisis, "there is no economic consolidation (Latin America), but it should serve to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport linkage between various locations in South America, especially rural and border areas... so that our countries are better connected and created new economic ties," the Peruvian President said in a speech.
He mentioned that five of these projects relate to Peru and its eastern axis from the coast to Brazil, and the other two relate to a better relationship with Ecuador, but he did not provide any more details.
The final document also covered the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its return to the Union of South American nations," which is currently excluded.
Another issue raised by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area, which is a celebratory and good neighbourly relationship.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before attending a regional meeting that he hoped that on Saturday in Mexico he would meet with his Nicaraguan opponent Daniel Ortego to discuss with respect the judgement of the International Court of Justice regarding the dispute on the maritime border that is disputed by the Bogotá.
"It is possible that I will meet with President Daniel Ortego on Saturday," Santos said.
"We are discussing all the solutions, none are excluded, and no agreement with Nicaragua, which would require negotiations with this country," he stressed.
"I hope that I will be able to tell President Ortega that we will conduct the most civilized and indiscriminate manner possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they are to participate in the inauguration of the dark President Enrique Peña Niety.
In the framework of the summit, the EU defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the area of defence.
UNASUR members are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the last country mentioned is currently excluded.
Peru is the interim president of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa today announced that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal in which "in this case South America must really learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the sixth presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on TV TV Peru that Europeans "killed for World Wars" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically one nation".
In this sense, the project to create a South American citizenship supported by the Member States of the Unasur organisation has been thwarted.
"The free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place among members of the Andean community must be achieved, however, there are still areas of return that wish to bring us back to the past," he pointed out.
The President of Ecuador, among other things, expressed his agreement with the regrouping of the United States Organization (OAS), provided that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States would be reduced and those who signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights would be taken into account.
"Those in the front are never committed to anything, and we the South American will sign it all.
It is unmistakable that the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights is funded by the United States in Washington," the founder WikiLeaks Julian Assange pointed out in an attack on political asylum.
President Correa confirmed that he did not respect this decision because he did not break his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at that time "there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange could be issued to a third country regardless of the ongoing process".
In addition, he criticised the Swedish justice who asked him to be interviewed in the Swedish territory for a alleged sexual offence, while "own Swedish legislation allows the hearing to be carried out by videoconferencing, which could be carried out by the equatorial embassy in London".
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange’s physical and mental health will deteriorate.
"I haven't talked to him since our embassy, but the embassy informed me that he had minor lung problems, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of state.
"But it threatens to worsen its physical and mental state, because it is locked in a small space without the possibility of moving in fresh air.
That would mark everyone's health," he added.
President Correa noted that the resolution of Assange's asylum granted to Assange since June at the University of Ecuador in London on the basis of permits that enables him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that talks were held with London with a view to resolving the imprisonment of founder WikiLeaks.
"We do not discuss human rights, we do not use such a word in this case, but talks have been held all the time.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European courts, because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón is leading a series of proceedings at various European courts," he mentioned.
He stated that "if the Great Britain leaves tomorrow, everything will be over."
And if Mr. Assange's Sweden is hearing at the equator's embassy in London or through Skype, how without a problem it enables dark legislation and how it has been done in other cases, this problem will be brought to an end tomorrow."
Correa took advantage of this situation to present himself as a defender of freedom of the press, and explained that he certainly did not tolerate "understanding, wrong intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression".
We are not the biggest enemies of the free press, we are and we are against politics, but bad journalists in profit, pressure and blackmail services," he said.
From this point of view, he expressed his joy that neither journalists, "no bankers, no hegemonic country nor bourgeoisie do not control Ecuador", and he predicted that if he was elected again, "he will continue in the changes led by the right path and direction".
President Correa also supported the decision to continue to maintain the veto expressed by Paraguay regarding membership in the Union of Unasur at least in its future elections and argued that the whole "must be firm and intolerance of opportunism and puhisism rooted in legality", because in fact "has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
In addition, the Ecuadorian President stated that he considered the wish of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, at the time following the judgement of the International Court of Hague, which decided in favour of Nicaragua.
At the moment, the judgment is not accepted.
"It's a problem between South America and Central America.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
It is necessary to assess the scope to be overcome and to be able to move forward."
He also expressed hope in the settlement of the maritime border dispute, which is settled at the same court in Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is appropriate for Latin America to search for international institutions if both countries undertake to take a judgment, whatever the case may be".
In connection with the possibility that he will run in the next presidential elections in Ecuador, to be held in the third mandate, he noted that he perceived this option "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa said that if in February 2013, she loses her election, she will leave public life.
"I have never personally been interested in the power, but the unfair situation, such as the socio-economic poverty in Ecuador, can only be corrected by political power.
My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I could win, it would be my last presidential period and then I would leave politics.
When we lose, it's the same for me.
I've already decided," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
"I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Madura, who says that President Chávez went to scheduled routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign ended.
It is not the same as the President's recovery," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian State today participated in the sixth summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of the South American Nations (Unasur), which was convened by calls for greater regional integration with a view to maintaining development, equality and security.
AIDS victims today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizi was 21 years old when the result of his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if a flash hit me," he says in memories of the moment of truth that the doctor was trying to "a little calm", but apparently without success.
The boy told it in front of the family.
He decided to take his illness on his own and start to inform himself about it, with such a commitment that he already celebrated the 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the latest HIV unit patients in the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after several disease attacks.
Fabrizio has been living with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was something unimaginable at the beginning of the 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, little treatment options and a greater stigma.
At that time, neither the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) clinic, "because he had a severe wound".
At the time, having AIDS was a death synonym.
Now it's possible to survive with this syndrome and live in full.
However, there are many people who don't know about their disease and come when the virus has caused the body to disappear and has sent out an immune system, and then they become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since the outbreak of AIDS in the world, or at least from the first documented cases, "it is a great success that the length of life of a patient who starts treatment in a timely and appropriate manner is exactly the same as for healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, by confirming this information in the April of this year's prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious and HIV/AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of survival and life expectancy depends on the degree of disability in the immune system of patients diagnosed and better on those who do not use drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells may live for up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells for 50 years.
Simply put, it means that the person diagnosed with HIV in 25 years of age can, according to these findings, "live without problems until 75 years", explained the doctor in the interview.
It is worth noting that the average life span of Mexicans is 76 years today.
Although death has decreased significantly in recent years and in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has decreased significantly from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients have died since AIDS was reported.
In the state of Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and by May 187. However, since 2005, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured.
Why do people still die from the consequences of the disease?
- "I don't think there's a problem with access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it happens at our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not exhausted the stocks of medicines. The problem is that patients come at a very advanced stage because they do not know the condition of the disease, or at a late stage of the disease."
It adds convincing data: "nine out of ten patients come when some associated infection is already developing. The only thing we need to do to be more able to affect overall mortality is to diagnose the disease before, and that is why it is important to offer large-scale tests to identify the disease to all those who are asking for it."
In its proposal, experts and officials from the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco and directly with patients such as Fabrizio, who came to make tests in a private laboratory only because they did so by his friend, and even through his low age, he had already contracted the AIDS disease and also suffered Kaposi’s sarcoma, a contagious disease, which is one of the usual complications.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm supposed to die, I'd rather get settled three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
The change was for the better, healthy, exercise, taking drugs."
To this day, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activity, I travel, I lead an active sexual life, but responsiblely, I pay attention to myself and to another person," says Fabrizio, who has taken the challenge of sharing his experience with the journal MILENIO JALISCO, to motivate those who are afraid of AIDS today.
"Let them do tests. If they risked, so that they know first if they are HIV positive, it's better, and if they've been diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like anyone else when they're responsible."
This message sets out the password of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms for the desktop
Between health programs and ordinary citizens is a major failure, Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajar journalist, who finds information about HIV.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "the distribution of condoms has really increased, we were given one or two, today we are given packages and hundreds of condoms, which are very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
They are among the most susceptible to new diseases.
"What do you want to do?" is a common question of irony and assessment from social workers, school counselors, medical staff and medical staff who want to avoid teenagers, says the reporter.
He proposed to change this ineffective distribution, so that condoms are not only behind the counters, but that hundreds be found in the public toilets, in places where young people often walk.
"It's not promiscuity support.
Nor is it "paying beer and motel" to them, as Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether he would agree with the distribution of condoms in his period.
It is not sexuality. It is best to access condoms to those who already lead sexual lives," he noted.
Key numbers in Jalisco State
13 435 cases (12 158 AIDS cases and 1,317 HIV cases) were reported.
This condition in Mexico means the fourth place in new and detected cases of AIDS and 13 places in relation to HIV.
92% of the disease is sexually transmitted, 6% of the bloodstream and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV, because in one registered case there are four to five people who do not know about the disease.
The judgment approved by the Court of Justice of the United States, which does not recognise the restructuring of the Group Vitro’s debt in Mexico, raises a bad precedent for any national business with branches in the neighbouring country and the problem of solvency.
It seems, then, that the restructuring procedures for companies that allow Mexican laws do not apply to the country of pipes and stars in spite of international agreements.
The approval of the judgment issued on 15 June last year by Judge Harline Halem of the North Texas Competition Court leaves Mexican companies in practice without defence against the possibility of confiscating their property on the other side of the river el Bravo.
However, the judgment opens the main Mexican producer of glass to the United States Supreme Court with a appeal against three inequalities.
It should be said that while the judge of this case claims that the creditors are to be governed by an insolvency law of the United States, the Court of Justice of the Fifth Period, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings are to establish a competition procedure in Mexico.
First, it would indicate the ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
For this purpose, a model law of the United Nations for the unification of international trade law has been established, which is determined by an arbitrator by the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment states that without voting the branch of the internal company, when the debt of the parent company Vitro to the branch was recognised, the requested majority would not be reached to approve the restructuring.
However, this option is permitted by Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro's case was not the first to adopt this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples here, such as Agrex and Commercial Mexican, for which the Federal Competition Institute has been responsible.
In addition, it is true that even after the vote was withdrawn, the believers - who opposed Vitro to the United States court, i.e. the funds of the "supply" such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - did not reach the majority.
In the vote, they would reach about 45 percent to 37.
This information shall not be taken into account by the court of appeal.
From a different perspective, Vitro’s court is guilty of a difficult situation that has been facing since 2008 - in the background of a serious economic crisis that has hit the United States.
In the meantime, González Sady's family will appeal for a new assessment directly at the court of appeal to allow the assessment to take place for full participation, i.e. for the participation of five judges, because they originally voted only three.
If it fails here, it will be required as a remedy for the revision of the higher court process, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
In the case, it is serious that the Court referred to a document sent by the Mexican Government as a service of a friend of the curiae, in which the Vitro procedure is described in detail under the Competition Act, and in which it points out that the company has facilitated itself by agreeing to agreements signed between the two countries in order to confront the law in question with Chapter 15 of the United States Insolvency Law.
Moreover, it points out that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, this is the rules for international insolvency cases that guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Hit on both sides: the punishment for Vitro and state.
Overall evaluation
Without noting the table, several months' criminal notice of the Mexican Air Force committees against the former owner of Gaston Azcarrag Andrade, who was ordered from the subversive proceedings, and according to the committee's pilot organisation, has already survived.
The authorities in front of Carlos Díaz Chavez Morineau just filed a complaint against the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which he accused of obstructing the achievement of justice.
According to it, the supervisory authority systematically refused to report to the Attorney-General of the Republic on the transaction carried out by this undertaking, in which it selected 198 million pesos on behalf of the company in Mexico, from Bank IXE from the F/589.
The media were probably directed to buy shares Professional Hotel Management (Administrator Professional de Hotels).
As you know, Azcarrag Andrade is a majority shareholder in the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Martu siege
In the Universidad de Caribe area, a group of domestic and foreign ecologists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens who approved the creation of a association met on the weekend in order to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as we know, about a huge shopping and distribution centre with products from "land with large walls" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential area for employees of 150 companies in the lower part.
The Canacintra (Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) has already managed to unite the governors of the southeast to stand against the monumental area, which would in part destroy protected areas and which represents the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of business with ACTA document
The request of the Senate, which the government did not take into account, and which required an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador signed the Trade Agreement against counterfeiting, known under the English short ACTA, in accordance with the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Méxicano de la Propidad Industrial).
As we know, it has happened so despite the fact that the Senate itself has excluded the possibility of viewing it as a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to pay off long-term debts and do not affect those short-term loans, the company Homex is placing 500 million pesos on the market for investment certificates.
This series is the first of the four identicals that offer interest payments every 28 days.
Born Competitive
The association of leading companies in information technologies such as NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet was formed by an association with a commercial name Competival, which aims to market software services in Central and South America.
Investment in business is going to exceed $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The basketball runner Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was associated with this saloon sport for more than 60 years and processed through him the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have memories of the history of local basketball, such as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was a player of the national basketball league BSN, the owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón team in the national basketball league, or the President of the Puerto Rican basketball federation, before he joined him in 2008.
"I stood up during my life in basketball, including a few at the same time as I was president of the BSN National League in the 1990s, general manager of the national team and president of the federation," Reyes reminded reporters of Primera Hora at home in Bayamón, where she has been living for more than 50 years with Isabel, her faithful wife.
"Basketbal was my life."
Reyes in his claim of failure.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and monuments from his long careers, testify.
Bayamón in the heart
With the biggest move from all the guards, those who remember his actions in Los Vaqueros since the mid-50s, where he was a player until 1982, at the same time celebrating 15 years as a co-owner or team owner.
"It was my best years, the one I used most because I had the opportunity to participate with the team Los Vaqueros since 1967 as a master, co-owner, or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I apologized to one of the champions - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy started in the BSN.
At that time, the team took over the "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," Reyes said.
"I remember Gene Bartow, who was here earlier as a coach and then acting at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, said to me, "I have an adult two-foot player for you.
Do you want it?"
And it was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended to me the player Raymond Gauss, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember saying that if Mincy brings Bayamon to the championship, Gauss will contribute to another."
The championship, when the Vaqueros team played Gauss, enjoyed, but was far away, because in 1988 he was already serving as president of the basketball federation.
At that time, he wanted to devote himself fully to his duties and to use Mincy's location as a national team.
"I remember how we first defeated the United States in a qualifying Olympic match in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the world's championship in 1990, where we ended the fourth, but we should have the bronze not to be the Canadian judge who let us repeat the final introduction," Reyes said.
Is the world's championship man in 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was a national team in the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we blew up the team of the United States, which was quite similar to the one that broke our bronze on the world championship.
It was not only Mincy, Gauss, Ramona Rivase, Fica López and "Piculina" (Ortiz), but also there were young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the Leon brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be on the team in 1990 due to knee injury.
A man who may not have had the perfect composition, but who managed to win the gold medal and bring great joy, was a man of the Olympic qualifications in 1995 in the Argentine Neukén.
With players on matches, such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alice and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced the players excluded because of the competition in the Panamanian games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all the predictions.
What was Puerto Rica's best player?
It was no doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one from Puerto Rica has reached this level of results such as Piculin.
Don't talk about his behavior in various leagues where he was playing.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very difficult.
We had a very good generation, including Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arilla's job very much from young people.
Which success in the federation do you consider to be the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous age of national manhood in 1988 to 1995 and that by the beginning of the 1990s, the national league had BSN in one season to 17 men.
What couldn't you do?
There were things I wanted to introduce as a distribution of youth categories by regions.
For example, Ponce boys would play only in their area and compete with teams from other island corners only in national playoffs.
Now the kids travel a lot and play too many games, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefits of mandatory certificates and courses for trainers, decision-makers and decision-makers.
I'm so glad.
What are you dedicated to now?
The most I listen to music, I watch YouTube videos with music from my time, I enjoy my grandchildren, and sometimes I go to basketball games.
And of course I'm using my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
The actor Larry Hagman died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, declared the world's main role of John Ross Ewing, known as "J.R." in the Dallas television series, where he was a man who acted independently and was indifferent and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the ancient oil magnet J.R. Ewing in the Dallas TV series, became a symbol of famine in the '80s, he died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in the new Dallas series, died according to the official family announcement that the Associated Press provided the production company Dallas Warner Bros. on Friday afternoon to complications associated with cancer.
"Larry returned to his beloved home town of Dallas, where he again played the iconic role he loved the most," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas on Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was the representative of his wife in the original and new series, was with Hagman at the time he died in a Dutch hospital," her agent Jeffrey Lane announced.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, generous, fun, nice, kind and talented and I'll miss him so much.
He was unique and lived his life full," led Linda Gray in the announcement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he himself admitted that he had been drinking for years.
In 1995 he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver, and Hagman underwent transplantation.
Years before the broadcast of the Dallas series, Hagman celebrated himself as a decent man in a remote comedy I Dream of Jeannie broadcast by NBC station from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (Gina), who plays Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He was also a protagonist in two comedys, which were sent only briefly, and it was The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His effectiveness in the films included roles that were well accepted by criticism: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was at Hangman's master's performance in the form of an incredibly repulsive J.R. that led him to the star summit.
The drama series CBS on the Ewings clan and other personalities around them was released from April 1978 to May 1991.
The propaganda slogan "Who shot Jayar?", which was supposed to trigger expectations about the work of full emotion, when Hangman's character was almost murdered, caused not only a huge number of speculators around the world, but also the risk of millions of dollars in bag offices.
It also helped to achieve a record in monitoring.
November 1980, in which the answer was revealed, watched 41 million TV viewers on average. Dallas became the second most popular series of stories after the end of the 1983 MASH series, which was attended by 50 million viewers.
On J.R. she shot his mother-in-law Kristin (who played Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. were pregnant and then threatened to label her as a prostitute if she didn't leave the city, but there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, an unscrupulous chamois with charismatic smile: a clever businessman and an unfaithful husband who was trying to get his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, locked up in the hospital.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on the tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be there: "There's an honest citizen of J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, recalled on Friday on Hagman as someone who was "blessed on the plate and beyond him".
It is unforgettable and irretrievable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who should have known and loved him.
Ten parts of the new Dallas series sent the TNT station a few months ago with great success.
"The film of five parts of the second row and the sixth has just been completed," the TV station reported.
Immediately after Hangman's death, no announcements were available from Warner or from the TNT station about how the series will continue.
A family from Fort Worth in Texas was the son of an actress and singer Mary Martin, who was fascinated by classical works such as the musicians South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when in 1931 she gave birth to Larry, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950 ’ s, Larry was lucky at the theatre scene in New York and then served in England from 1952 to 1956 at the airport.
There he met a young Swedish designer, Maj Axelson, who married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and for a long time they lived in the California city of Malibu, where they lived a lot of celebrities.
In 2001 he published the autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Talll (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't do anything there that I knew could hurt someone or hurt him," said Press Association agency.
After liver transplantation, he began to engage in organ donation promotion and worked as a volunteer in a hospital where he helped the war patients.
"I do them, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them comfort in the sense of, "Don't worry, it'll be a bit uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be healthy."
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
Starts a course that examines "the end of the world"
Every week, students study apocalypse themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
When the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided that this semester would take a course on the end of the world, he knew that it was an inalienable asset: the end of the "long number" of May's calendar, which is due to arrive on 21 December, many people were caught as proof that the end of the world is coming.
Charmé, however, had no idea what was waiting for him in the next few months: Catastrophe Hurricane Sandy, a budget failure that some call a "debt Armageddon", and a growing conflict in which Israel is trapped, where Christians who are theorizing about the end of the world will begin.
"I didn't realize that this would be the most inexplicable semester he ever was," Charmé told Rutgers University students in Camden in New Jersey this week.
It's a really good time to figure out what's going on in the world today, like we've had 30 days left.
And remember, it means bad for apocalyptic thinking good.
And it's not the only professor who offers courses about the "end of the world" in this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At the University of Temple, Barry Vucker will take a course on "Middles, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students study apocalypse themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
"We choose why these ideas are expanding over time," she says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, the war can break out.
This month, students analyze films with apocalyptic themes and examine how they differ from real life examples.
"I tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," says Vucker.
In the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restaurant and his colleague Amara Solari, a professional assistant in art history and anthropology, were given together to arrange a course with a simple name at the end of the world.
"We don't connect "2012," because we're always counting on the possibility of reorganizing the course if the world doesn't end," said Restal.
Even through "dangerous disappearance", students must study, design projects and perform final tests.
On Penn State, a final test will take place on the evening of the Apocalypse, which does not give students a chance other than to work "until the evening of the predicted end of the world," said Restal.
Courses have become quite popular.
"He grew up in two hours," said Restall about his high-average student course, which he applied for 35.
Weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received an e-mail question as to whether it was still in place.
The students themselves make sure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people are doing to please themselves," she said at Rutgers University in Camden, 23 years old Bridged Robinson, a student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield in New Jersey.
So apocalyptic, worldly, or religious thought is only a question of comfort or its absence.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he saw all the apocalypse movies.
"I've never heard of an hour in which it could be taught," he said.
"I enjoy it."
But no spoken student, but the professor, did not say he believed in the date of the end of December 21.
"Our first project discussed the Mayan prediction and we're going to throw it out in a certain way," said Julie Zeglenová, a 21-year-old student of the last year at the Temple University of West Chester.
"May's never foretold the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," said the Restall.
But he added that in Western culture there is an apocalyptic anxiety that spans several centuries back, which people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The spread of these speculations caused the Internet.
"People don't think about it elsewhere," he said.
This is what happens in the absolute majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who is teaching in the Philippines this year, asked if he knew about any course on "the end of the world," he answered quickly.
"The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world," he wrote and pointed out an exception to the highest authority.
We have the Pope's mercy.
The restaurant noted that over the years it has been about many days of the last court, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will start to think immediately about the next date" or to think that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period whose end will disappear.
The date is taken by the students and the professors.
Several of them said they were going to celebrate the end of the world.
"I'll call a few friends to laugh together," explained a 20-year-old student of Samira Ford communication.
