Joseph Wyko’s father: I saw Jesus in the white crowd
He's a charismatic.
The holy mass of relief and healing that he performed brings the crowd back to life.
He was a couple of years old when things began to go unexplained in his life.
Today, through Franciscanine, others experience this.
To the o. Wikko Mass St. about the release and healing of the crowd
At one time, a 7-month-old child came to him who had a 7.5 mm hole in his heart.
It was supposed to be operational.
Joseph Witko’s father prayed about him.
On the same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for surgery.
Amazing doctors said: "The operation is not necessary, the death is only 1.5 mm".
My parents were crying out of happiness.
After another prayer, Franciscanine disappeared completely.
The Creator has begun to experience extraordinary spiritual activities as a teenager.
In a dream, pure souls came to him with a request for help.
I was awakened at night and compelled to pray for the dead and for those who died at that time, as mentioned.
He also experienced the presence of a wicked spirit.
And he had a vision of what would happen to a man who committed mortal sin.
“My body began to change.
I lost human characteristics and started to take a look at the animal," he says.
The invisible force took him up, couldn't get his voice out of him.
He felt lost.
Then God gave him salvation.
“I was set free in the waters of the river symbolizing the baptism of the holy, and I returned to the human form...”, he says.
He didn't tell anyone about those strange experiences.
There was a call coming up in him.
He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.
In his sermons, he not only wanted to tell about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the Charismatic Community Resumption in the Holy Spirit
In the healing tables of Father Witko will be attended by many who expect to get sick.
However, the spiritual one emphasizes that their primary goal is spiritual healing, not physical healing.
First defeat of Kolpinga FRAC Jarosław
Today (September 26th) on the afternoon of the Kolpinga FRAC team, the award was awarded to the current Polish champion Dartom Bogori Grodzisk Mazowiecki in the 3rd row of LOTTO Superligi Table Tennis.
Jaroslaving in such a personal set as they presented with the Grapes has no chance of winning with the League's sovereigns.
He showed this one with Darth Bogory.
The team still lacks the team leader Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps, in his composition, he would have won the third of the triumphs in the new season.
Young Asian Qiyao Han seems to have not yet grown to win with such poems as Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, that is, the Badow Mark.
The racer from Hellady was the largest single star in the MOSIR hall at Sikorski Street in Jarosław.
Both at the age of Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei were a class for themselves.
After three singles, Kolping FRAC ran 2:1.
Kou Lei probably won Mark Badowski, and Daniel Goroak after an emotional, five-year battle – Paul Siruck.
But then it was worse.
Gionis didn't give Lei a chance.
It was possible to hope for a two-point victory, but Qiyao Han did not succeed in Badowska.
There will be no further studies for seniors.
Why?
According to Raphał Trzaskowski, a free prophylactic research programme for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be put into effect because it has not been accepted by the Ministry of Health and is subject to the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technology and Classification.
For reasons, the Agency explained that the target group was badly selected.
“These actions may contribute to the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to deepening difficulties in accessing NFZ services and adversely affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with false positive results of the studies”, it said.
The decision of the resort doesn't understand the President of the capital.
"The money is ours, we predicted it.
Only the government is afraid that if people are tested, they will later go to the doctor, which is absurd, because it is just to lead to a situation where prevention can be made faster.
All experts know that this helps when it comes to the burden of the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a sound approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand," said Rafael Trzaskowski.
“I find it hard to imagine that running specialists are saying, ‘Don’t try because there will be longer lines with the doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, it’s not surprising that there is a health service in that condition,’ the PO said.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all the agreements that have been reached.
Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas announced on Thursday at the UN General Assembly that any agreement concluded with Israel would be broken if the future government of that country tried to comply with Benjamin Netanyahu's command to annex the occupied Palestinian countries.
"If the future government of Israel is to come to an agreement to implement this plan, we will cancel all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made," he said.
"We reject the whole plan completely and completely," said Abbas.
"It is our duty to defend all our rights by all possible means – little of what will happen – by fully engaging in the implementation of international law and in the fight against terrorism," said the President of the Palestinian Authority, who has already made similar statements in July.
Netanyahu, the former Prime Minister of Israel, again received a government formation mission after the September 17 elections.
A week before his election, he ordered that if he wins, he announces the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intends to include in Israel all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank.
In the early 1990 ’ s, Israel and the Palestinians, then led by Jaser Arafat, signed a number of peace agreements that were sponsored by the United States.
84-year-old Abbas also promised at the UN General Assembly meeting to hold the Palestinian elections on the ground.
They were last held in 2006.
"After returning to the country, I called on the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem local elections and all those who would oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," the Palestinian President declared.
Abbas also defended, in his speech, the rights of Palestine, treated as a permanent observer in the United Nations, for the use of the powers of "full-fledged members of the United Nations and all its organs and institutions".
The Palestinian leader concluded his call to the international community to "force Israel to comply with all respect for the provisions of the United Nations".
Ambassador of Israel Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas' speech, stating that the Palestinian leader "is willing to focus in the UN on the efforts of the Palestinian Autonomous Authority against Israel rather than to fight against calls for terrorism in Autonomy under its leadership".
Danon, as the agencies say, did not, however, refer to the annexes of the occupied Palestinian lands promised by Netanya.
Rats want defibrillators at the neurologic points of the Industry
The history of the border crossing shows that the automatic defibrillator AED can save human life.
The Mayor of the Ratunk Potojów Station in Industry wants these devices to be located in the city's neurological points.
For their position, officials received congratulations from the Vyvojvodz Institute of Ratunktoy in Industry.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, Senior Applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wojcik are officials of the Podkarpackic Office of Treasure Customs in Industry.
On 28 August, they served on the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medica. The official of the Customs-Skarbow Service noticed a man lying unconscious in a pedestrian area.
The Chinese activist died in the arrest for torture.
He wanted to take advantage of the rights guaranteed by the Constitution
To Cao Shuxia, a female activist, on 23 September, the secretary of the Communist Party from her family village called to inform her that her husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
What was the cause of death – he did not reveal.
In Cao's bones, she saw the body of a man slaughtered, not for recognition.
"His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were all in blood," she says.
"They didn't let me take a cell phone with them, and there were a lot of cops around who couldn't get close to Wang."
The police pressured her to sign a statement that her husband was seriously ill and died as a result of a "unfortunate accident".
105 million zł for companies in the video game industry from the National Research and Development Centre
Almost 105 million dollars of funding comes from gaming companies, creating innovative solutions.
The National Research and Development Centre announced on Friday the results of the third edition of the GameINN programme.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the NCBR were the development of a platform for the creation of field games based on a real-world real-world gaming engine, with an application for the transmission of data by users; a testing-school platform for the verification of practical skills at work and professional excellence using VR and AI technology; an innovative game for the management of real-time production processes using a innovative model based on virtual-world interaction with the real-world concept of industry 4.0 – provided in the NCBR communication sent on Friday of the PAP.
The aim of the GameINN sector programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish sector of video games producers in the global market by 2023.
According to the NCBR, today the Polish video game sector is growing at 10% a year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to 1.85 billion zł and the forecast for 2019 is 2.23 billion.
"The gameINN research agenda, which has already reached 300 million zł support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral programme, is an important incentive for further, dynamic growth of Polish games," we read in the Communication.
The video game industry is an excellent example of the effective use of the potential we have in Poland.
"Incentives from the government to innovative entrepreneurs such as B+R reliefs, competence improvement programmes, IP box or support programmes implemented by the NCB are encouraging innovation companies and allowing them to be more competitive on a highly competitive market," the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the Communication, assesses.
The head of the science resort points out that money for innovation not only brings innovations in the form of project funding, but also remains in their pockets – in the wake of the B+R in 2018, three fourths more entrepreneurs than a year ago.
‘The estimated costs for B+R activities amounted to 1,7 billion zł, resulting in more than 300 million złs of savings for companies benefiting from this benefit.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCB in the three editions of GameINN," the Deputy Prime Minister stressed.
The Director of NCBR Dr. Wojciech Kamenieński recalls, however, that 78 innovative projects have been awarded a total of over 211.2 million in the two previous funding tenders.
The huge interest in competition III and the variety of applications made show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and enhance its competitive advantages.
"It is particularly pleased that there are projects for not only entertainment but also industry 4.0-related solutions – as in previous editions," he adds.
In the third GameINN competition for funding of up to 20 million zł, entrepreneurs, consortium of entrepreneurs and consortium of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply.
The total amount of funding of approximately EUR 317 million was 87 applications to the NCB.
The tender budget at the time of the invitation to tender was 100 million zł, but it was increased, making it possible for 27 projects to receive almost 105 million złs of funding.
Detailed information on the results of GameINN competition III is available on ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN Sectoral Program is implemented under the Operational Intelligent Development Program.
NCBR launched a programme in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated with the Polish Game Agreement, which includes, among other things, companies such as CD Project, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team or 11-bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga confessed to stealing Kaspera Dolberg's watch
It happened on September 16th.
Dolberg, who finally arrived from Ajacs Amsterdam to Nice in late August, focused on training that his watch had disappeared from the barn.
It's not like that, because it's worth 70,000 euros.
The angry Danes didn't show up in class the next day, interpreting stomach problems.
The matter was a mystery from the beginning.
The dancers in the closet have private safes available, and the club area is monitored.
According to the AFP agency, he was finally admitted to theft by Diaby-Fadiga.
He already apologized to Dolberg and other colleagues from the team and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised the Danish to return the money for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising players of a young generation in France.
He went to Nice as a 13-year-old to get into the first team three years later.
This season was held in seven matches.
He recently signed a professional contract, but, as the newspaper "L'Equipe" said, the club is likely to dissolve it with immediate effect.
At the moment, a disciplinary action was taken against his champion.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on this matter.
See if you can wash your hands.
We all know that they need to be washed (e.g. after coming home or before meals).
But not everyone knows that in order to actually get rid of the contagion, we need to do it properly.
This is especially important now that autumn infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30 to 40 seconds to remove sufficiently dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands.
And most of us are shorter!
Just warm water and regular soap – it’s not true that it has to be antibacterial (many doctors are handing it over).
We wash not only the lower and upper hands, but also: the ends of the fingers (joined or individually) – wipe them with the wheels of the inside of the second hand, the space between the fingers (spread out your hands, rub your fingers around yourself), the fingers – each finger embraces the other hand and in such embrace we turn them right and left for a moment.
In an emergency situation (when you can't wash your hand) we should shake hands with a wet cough and then use an antibacterial gel (in drogeries, 5 zł).
After using the public toilet, do not touch your hands or doors (the recommendation of the Chief Inspector of Health).
Open them through the paper manual.
President of Iran says he has rejected US talks, Donald Trump rejects
Tehran did not hold talks with the American side during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite the American bid to abolish the sanctions, President Hasan Rowhani announced on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump commented that this is an Iranian party asking for the removal of restrictions, which he did not agree to.
According to President Hasan Rowhani of Iran, the United States has proposed abolishing all the sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.
It should regulate both the Iranian nuclear programme and the ballistic missiles building programme.
Rowhani: Iran will not take talks in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
The President of Iran said he did not agree to this conversation because of the "toxic atmosphere".
He claimed to have met with American diplomats because he had been hired by France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
However, he stressed that Iran would not take talks in the atmosphere of "maximum pressure".
"And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in 5+1 format, nobody is able to predict what the outcome will be," Rowhani said.
On the day before, the Iranian leader said he was not excluding talks with the United States, and he accused European parties of favouring the US sanctions on Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran after the US entered into a nuclear agreement "with an initial condition that would not allow" to engage in dialogue.
If we are able to overcome this initial condition and if America removes sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America – he said.
He added that he did not rule out a meeting with US President Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a conversation in the coming week at the UN General Assembly.
Trump: "Iran asked, I said no."
Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he rejected the Iranian side request.
"Iran wanted me to bear the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course I said "no!" the U.S. president insisted.
Voltage with the nuclear agreement in the ground
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran in some way to save the 2015 agreement with Iran, which was signed by the signatories.
It decided that, in exchange for the abolition of economic sanctions, Iran would abandon the nuclear-weapon-building programme and the nuclear sector would be subject to the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAEA).
Since the withdrawal of the US from the May 2015 agreement, its signatories have repeatedly confirmed their wish to maintain an agreement in force.
It didn't work out for the moment.
Washington is using the maximal pressure strategy for Iran, and sanctions include the full embargo on Iran's oil.
Teheran said that if he does not receive permission to export raw materials, he will limit his obligations under the agreement by 60 days.

The judge of the Administrative Court in Warsaw and her husband, Emili, who, according to her words and screens from WhatsAppa, participated in the strike against the judges, was re-elected in the middle to be found by the NSA.
Reason: The disciplinary procedure has not been initiated against him, and therefore there is no reason to support the administration of the WSA President Wojciech Mazura to withdraw him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary speaker at the NSA, initiated an investigation against Smydt at the end of August, but it has not yet been turned against him.
Although the NSA, which in such cases acts as a disciplinary court, must take the decision of the President of the WSA within one month of its publication.
In this situation, the judge, who publicly spoke about his wife's mental problems in order to discredit her, who was removed from the KRS office because of suspicions of participation in the Heresy Group, returned to the horticulture and issued judgments on behalf of the Polish Republic.
Judge Smydt denies his participation in the Heterian Group.
He claims that there is no evidence of this in front of the falsified screens and his wife's words to divorce.
That's exactly what the judges say: they're all innocent, there's no evidence.
And it's quite possible that they're on their own.
Because the prosecution didn't shake its finger to secure evidence from their electronic carriers, it also silences the content of the phone Emili Szmydt, which the phone stopped in June in another case.
The police didn't shake their finger to protect the devices of people whom they as persecutors pointed out in a report from Judge Waldemar Žurek last February.
There's no evidence – there's no Smydt case, there's no "Cash" case.
There is also no case with Chief Mariana Banasis to rent a stone to the Suteners and hide the income.
The CBA shall verify its statement of assets.
And he'll check when he checks.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy will not take part in this process because the Seim is suspended (but the Committee on State Control has somehow come together to take a decision to revoke the representatives of Banasia and to appoint his lawyer, although the law does not provide for such an extraordinary combination).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie novel, an American mistake about how a wife returns home and stands up to her husband with a lover in bed.
She's so amazed and confused she can't spell words.
She's standing in the door uninvited, and at the time, the lover jumps out of bed, clothes and goes out.
And her husband's getting laid.
When a wife regains her voice and cries out, "What's this supposed to be?"
Who is this woman?
My husband calmly asks, "What kind of woman, darling?"
It's just that "Cash" or "Banasia" is going to be a state parody.
And that's not funny at all.

Camila Ličvinko in the final jump up
Previously returning to the season for the rivalry after the break of the Maternity Championship, the bronze medalist of the London World Championships 2017, was the first attempt to defeat 1.85 and 1.89 and the second 1.92.
1,94 managed to achieve it in a third approach.
"I'm glad.
I showed that I could fight because the first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the end, I'm going to have to jump more technically," she admitted to the Eurosport camera Ličwinko.
In the eliminations, the best was the American Vashti Cunningham and the Belarusian Karina Demidik – after 1.94.
Both fighters as the only ones didn't lose any height.
The final jump for women was scheduled for Monday.
Starting at 7:30 p.m. Polish time.
Cornel Morawiecki is in a hospital in difficulty
He went to the hospital, and his doctors define his condition as difficult.
You have to add that he's conscious and conscious.
"We believe it will come out of this that it will win again.
We all pray for him to come back to health," said an anonymous close friend of Kornel Morawiecki in a conversation with the journalists "Super Express".
In the upcoming elections, the Prime Minister's father is running to the Senate.
"My closest family and politics are keeping me alive," said Cornel Morawiecki in an interview he gave two weeks ago to the Super Express journalist.
In January, "Super Express" reported that 78-year-old Cornel Morawiecki was visiting the Military Hospital in Wrocław.
“I experienced strange, disturbing symptoms and went to the hospital.
It turns out I've got a yellow.
But the worst was in front of me.
When a computer tomographer study was conducted, it was found that I had a new pancake...," the Prime Minister's father said.
A few days later, a serious operation took place at MSViA Hospital in Warsaw, Cornel Morawiecki.
As Morawiecki said, President Andrzej Dud sent his personal chaplain, Prince Zbigniew Kras, to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and ran smoothly.
"I know that many people have prayed for me that I am very grateful for.
Luckily, I don't have any interruptions.
I don't know if I'm going through chemotherapy yet.
I give myself to doctors of specialists who are rather good at thinking.
In the meantime, after this difficult operation, I have to go back to some state of use.
I hope everything will be all right," said Cornel Morawiecki in January in the conversation with the SE.
"If I was too late to study, the situation would be tragic and I'd be happy with that fall..." he added.
Kraków: She's 14 years old.

She died on September 26 at night, leaving her place of residence and has not returned to the present time, nor has she been in contact with her loved ones.
The last time I saw her was at the Old Guest Street in Krakow.
Nel Stoklosa is 14 years old, measuring 167 cm, has blonde hair and gray-haired eyes.
When she was last seen, she was dressed in a blouse, gray underwear and shoes.
Anyone who has any information about the missing is requested to contact the police under number 12 61-52-911, 12 61-53-616 or 112, 997.
Power of lead jumps.
The title of the relationship between amateur sports events, played on Sunday afternoon, September 15th at a hypodrome on Oleandra Street in Olava, may be for some mistaken.
The real power of the road is far away, but that's the name of one of the kind of horse racing...
The race of the race power is to be defeated by the rider and horse, which in the most prestigious international professions exceeds even two meters.
It is worth adding that the long and still uninhabitable record of the world, established in 1949, by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the "Huaso" horse, is 247 cm.
So high in Olava, of course, no one jumped, but the result of the best local Amazons at 135 cm is also the worst...
The competitions organised by the unarmed Jan Sienkiewicz and other JKS operators “In the saddle”, were an indicative part of the earlier series of the “Vulnerable Wagons” on page 22.
Eight Amazons trained in oil mining in the U.S.
Four competed on hips and four on big horses.
In the first group, it was best written by Nikola Szołdra, who bore the crazy "Sprinter".
The small, but how dynamic the hump began to overcome the obstacles of 40 cm high and ended only at the station with a top white distance of 125 cm from the ground.
However, he did not give up easily, and only after three further refusals was the competition jury removed from the competition.
Amelia Pawlak, a member of the "Fami" group, and Lena Borunj on "Harmiderze" took the second place in the jumps.
She fought the youngest tour participant - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping through obstacles to the little "Carmen".
Even more emotions were associated with starting Amazons and seeing the competition with large horses.
Terrible dropouts included Paulina Szewczyk, a dissipating "Declaration" and Anastasia Abramenko, who was on the "Flotce".
Luckily, there was nothing wrong with the little kisses or the Amazons or the horses, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A lot of problems with the introduction of the young "Wineta" to the park had torpedo her by Veronika Lücziewicz.
She needed either an assistant coach or another horse for a couple with a little crazy "Wineta".
After counting the obstacle from the park, she also went full-fledged, so moments in the boxes and at the dilapidator became dangerous. "It's all under control!", Jan Sienkiewicz calmed down some of these frightened visions, especially the younger ones.
Since the start of the competition of the big horses, Marta Masalska has been a great man on the park, with a beautiful ‘Whisky’ presentation.
This worthy broom, in a pair of experienced Amazons, after the second approach in the final phase as the first jumped 135 cm and it was the best result at that time.
At the same time, however, Paulina Szewczyk was also counted as "Declaration", and Heronika Lüczkiewicz as "Winece" and Anastazja Abramenko as "Lotce".
So all these racers went out together to decorate the fleet and after receiving the prizes in the shape of the mine equipment, and finally, together with the amazons on the corners of the Radecki march, they made an effective round of honors, finishing it with these interesting and exciting races.
Thank you.
The Jäzdijki Sports Club "In Siodle" warmly thanks to the sponsors of the competition for the power of jump during the XVI "Vocations of the Jäzdijki": the City Office in Olaw, the Waterways and the Canalization Institute in Olaw, the Air Age and the company "Mustang".
Max Kolonko tossed from KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko
KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which the political formation #R Revolution Mariusza Max Kolonki was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution has directed its proposal, especially to young voters of legal opinion.
Before the Kolonko elections, he ordered cooperation with Mark Jakubiak, or Paul Kukiz, but none of these coalitions had arrived, and the Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko himself failed to collect enough signatures to show the letters in any electoral district in Poland.
Kolonko now reported on Twitter that he ended his collaboration with the KWW Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko.
"I'll expect to delete my name from KWW.
He would welcome my person's non-connection with the entity," he added and ordered more information soon.
At the moment it is not known whether the journalist will continue his work or whether it is the end of the formation of #R Revolution.
On 4 July, on the American Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko from the United States informed about the creation of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko has been filming on the YouTube channel Max TV, where he comments on events in Poland and the world.
"We have enough politicians, enough of your stupid games, enough of your amateur governments.
It was time for the authorities in the country to embrace the people and rule for the good of the people," Kolonko said.
The Party's programme includes matters relating to jurisdiction (to be chosen in general elections), tax changes (comparation of tax-free amounts for all), military repairs (in the form of military assistance for the countries of eastern NATO, with special consideration for Poland), referendum on arms possession, the reduction of the number of posts or the introduction of single-mandate electoral districts.
A few days after the announcement of a new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko joined the talks with Mark Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko posted information on his profile in social media suggesting that #R will connect forces to the Kukiz'15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions have finally arrived.
UBS: Gold close to balance point
"The euro course will last for the next few months in the vicinity of cap 4,35 zł, so that there will be a weak economy in global markets," says Michael Bolliger of the UBS Wealth Management company.
"The expectation of maintaining a solid pace of economic growth and a stable monetary policy is talking about the stabilization of gold notations in the current trap," the expert assesses in the discussion with Bankier.pl.
In his view, despite the clear inflationary pressure of the Monetary Policy Council, the Council does not decide to raise its feet in an environment in which the vast majority of central banks are making policy easier.
“If gold is properly valued – euro ratings should be maintained in the next few months in the area of cap 4,35 zł – there are so little attractive Polish bonds according to it.
Much more favourable profitability than Polish paper offers emerging markets bonds," says Michael Bolliger, head of the asset allocation in the emerging markets with UBS Wealth Management.
According to the specialist, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the world's economy.
"The global slowdown can be further deepened, but there should not be a severe recession, and, above all, the GDP dynamic is slightly below zero," says Michael Bolliger.
“Investments should be ignored by investors in global actions that may damage the prospects for a US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including the Donald Trump impeachment procedure and brexit.
Europe should be relatively weak in the stock markets," the latest list for investors of the main authority managing UBS Wealth Management Mark Haefele shows.
"The actions of the euro area countries should behave worse than the Americans, because they are more vulnerable in terms of increased uncertainty about global trade and fear of slowing down," we read in the document.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the debt market in the bond markets of the most secure countries has driven the German profitability of 10 years even down to 0.74 percent, it is still possible to deepen the profitability down.
However, in the longer term, the profitability of long-term and short-term securities should no longer fall due to the slowdown in monetary policy of banks.
The biggest field to lower feet has Fed, which should lead to a weakening of the US currency in the next year's horizon.
The long-term balance sheet for euro banknotes is a ceiling of USD 1.29, which would represent a 19-percent potential for strengthening the single currency to the dollar.
We expect further reductions in Fed's feet, which will result in a reduction in the world's monetary policy.
“The long-term maintenance of the dollar can prevent current and budgetary deficits,” says Michael Bolliger.
The Bundeswehrea loses the weapon.
Confidential German MON report
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehra has recorded the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19,445 ammunition – the result of the secret assembly of the RFN defence facility.
Information was provided by the press belonging to the media group EditorsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the Parliamentary Office, the Secretary of State at MON Peter Tauber (CDU) has so far been able to retrace two weapons, one part of the weapons and 3474 ammunition.
Among the military equipment that is still missing are six MG3, 11 G3, four G36 automatic carbines, six signal guns and two P8 pistols.
In addition, 30 lufs are missing for MG3 machine carabines.
The vice president of the Lewica Party, Martin Renner, expressed concern about the situation.
As RND reporters have said, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is “contemplative”.
Moreover, only a small part of the lost equipment was found as a result of the investigation.
Martin Renner summarised the effects of these actions as "necessary balances".
She also criticised the fact that the composition did not show whether there were any weapons found during the investigation against Lieutenant Bundeswehry Franco A. In December 2017 the Federal Prosecutor in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening State security and violating the law on access to firearms.
The officer was accused of preparing threats to German policy in the face of extreme legal and racist incentives.
His "black list" of goals, which came into the hands of the prosecutor, included the former Minister of Justice Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, human rights defenders and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung Foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. entered illegal possession of four firearms, more than 1000 ammunition and more than 50 explosives.
Crying kids on the plane.
How to avoid them?
There's a solution.
The carrier of Japan Airlines has recently used a function designed for people for whom travelling with a crying child is a nightmare.
By means of the website, the lines allow for the inspection of the location of the aircraft.
If this connection travels minor to the second year of life, the "child icon" appears on a specific, reserved by parents or guardians of the seat.
The same person who benefits from the services of the carrier has the opportunity to choose a place far away from that occupied by the small one.
The BBC reports that the lines have already informed about the inefficiency of this solution.
The "child icon" will not appear when the ticket has been booked by a third person or if the aircraft has been changed recently.
As expected, the idea was shared by the internet.
Some Twitter users point out that the problem of travelling with crying children can be solved by listening to noise reduction.
They're kids, we used to be them.
"We need to learn tolerance, because we will soon need maps of places for breathing mouth, sneezing or drinking," said user G Sundar.
Another of the netizens noticed that he had been harassed by children crying on the plane, but changed his mind when he became a parent himself.
There is also no need for Japan Airlines to issue a solution.
"Thank you for warning me against screaming children during a 13-hour trip," Rahat Ahmed wrote.
Major counts losses after bankruptcy of Thomas Cook's office
More than 25 thousand foreign tourists will not arrive in October on leave to Majorka as a result of the announcement on Monday of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook's travel office.
As reported on Friday by the autonomous representative of the Balearic Government of Marc Pons, among the 25 thousand contemporaries who could not benefit from the October break in Majorce, there are also those who were to travel with companies directly related to Thomas Cook, e.g. Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80% of the expected contemporaries who, due to the fall of the British company, had to give up their retirement in Majorce next month were German citizens and Scandinavian states.
However, as Pons says, because Thomas Cook did not lead tourists to the Balearic Islands during the November-April period, losses for the local economy will be smaller.
He found that the Balearic government had already begun negotiations with international operators on "the entry into the market of Majorka" following the bankruptcy of the British operator.
According to the newspaper Diario de Mallorca, more than 1,000 people lose their jobs in October because of the tourist crisis in Majorce.
About 800 are fired officers from Thomas Cook's office in Palmie.
Other people lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, along with the announcement of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook in many hotels Majorki property owners asked the guest to pay an additional fee per night.
This situation has experienced, among other things, a few dozen tourists from Poland.
By Thursday, the Balearic Government considers that several hundred hotels in Majorce have stopped at least until the end of October in connection with Thomas Cook's announcement of bankruptcy and cooperating companies.
In turn, the Friday newspaper "Diario de Ibiza" shows that most hotels in Ibiza, which cooperated with Thomas Cook, do not deal with the intention of closing the premises in the next few weeks.
The newspaper reminds us that on this Balearic Island, the British bankruptcy cooperated with 42 hotels.
The Balearic Autonomic Authorities have announced that they will contact the Government of Spain to support the region with EUR 100 million to cover the losses caused by the bankruptcy announcement by Thomas Cook's travel office.
They found that the most damaged on this tourist archipelago, about 36,000 people, is located in Majorce.
According to the Balearic Government, Thomas Cook is responsible for the local tourism company, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts for the period July–September 2019 of around € 5 million.
Ranking FIFA women.
Poland still in 29th place, USA in front
The Polish women's representation takes place on Friday in the International Football Federation (FIFA) ranking.
In the same position, the team of Coach Milosz Staupinski was classified in the previous July composition.
It's a weak sword of leather.
How's it going to be in October?
The leaders were the remaining Americans who recently defended the title of the world’s champions.
The second place in the ranking was kept by the Germans, and the third remained by the Dutch.
The Poles are preparing to qualify as ME.
They were supposed to start a race match with the Czechs on September 3rd.
The day before the meeting, it was postponed a year because of food poisoning.
In this situation, the Polish are insinuating the qualifications for a meeting with Spain on November 12th in Lublin.
Earlier, "White-Red" played two games – October 3 to leave Cyprus, and five days later in Kielcach with Brazil.
In the group of rivals Poland are representatives of Spain, Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
Winners and three best teams from other places advance directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six teams from the other positions are playing in the barracks with the last three trips to the European Championships.
The number of participants is 16 in addition to the owner – England.
The male representation of Poland in the FIFA ranking in September fell from 20th to 22nd.
"Rz": Smog oppressed the government
"The effects of the clean air program are nowhere, and carbon furnaces will sink this winter as if nothing ever," we read on the first page of today's "Rzeczpospolit".
“To date, 82,000 applications for funding of a total value of 2 billion zł have been submitted under the Clean Air programme, of which 48,000 were positive.
The accepted proposals amount to over 915 million zł', "Rz", referring to data from the spokesperson of the Minister of the Environment.
As the newspaper points out, only part of the costs incurred is returned from the programme.
The results of the cloudy programme are considered to be "low".
Self-governments quoted by "Rz" are looking at the defeats of "Clean Air" in, among other things, too large a bureaucracy.
‘The programme should be much simpler: electronic notification, e-mail invoices, possible out-of-date verification of implementation.
This would improve the action," said Mayor of the Warminian People's Bar Jacek Wisniowski.
Activists from the Polish Smog alert note, however, that in the first year of action less than 1 per cent of the established target for the exchange of 3 million miners.
Although the programme budget is 103 billion zł for 10 years, i.e. 10 billion zł, this amount is virtual.
"The National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management has been reserved for this year by 1.4 billion people," we read.
Congress agrees on F-35 for Poland
Blaštak: Now price negotiations
Congress of the United States agreed to sell Poland 32 of the latest F-35 aircraft.
"It is one of the last steps before the conclusion of the contract, but not the end of our work," Mariusz Blasztak wrote on Twitter.
"We will negotiate hard to achieve the best price," the Polish minister added.
Agreement on the Polish F-35
Polish Air Force have a target of 32 F-35 Lightning II fishermen produced by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, the Department of State of the United States expressed its agreement on their sale in Poland.
The Communication stressed that investment in support of national security and foreign policy by improving the security of NATO's allies, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department, Poland is expected to pay $6.5 billion for fishing.
But it's not the final price.
The State Department noted that the contract would also include the delivery of spare parts and repair equipment, training equipment, engineering, logistics and personnel services, and related elements of logistics and programme support and staff training.
Thinker Lockheed Martin F-35
The F-35 Lightning II thinker produced by Lockheed Martin is a multitasker of the fifth generation.
The aircraft is capable of carrying out a mission of close support, bombing and typically fishing tasks for air combat.
The use of stealth hunter technology is not detectable for close range radars.
Recently, F-35 fishermen bought Belgium under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace the old F-16.
Other US allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, are also expected to consider the purchase of American warplanes.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Men's or boys' underpants, knitted or crocheted
The manufacturer of Barbie placed a series of neutral rings on the market in sex.
He wants to fight stereotypes this way.
Barbie's producer placed a series of neutral sex dolls on the market
Alongside Barbie, with different colors of skin, figure or hairstyle, Mattel introduced a neutral sex doll for sale.
Toys from the Creative World series carry feathers.
Therefore, children can decide whether Barbie should have short hair or long hair.
Their wardrobe consists of both underwear and dresses.
In breeding the eyes of the dolls, the girls can become boys and vice versa.
They are also available in different colors of the skin and with different clothing.
It was also rejected by emphasising the characteristics of gender characteristics – gender dolls no longer have full mouth, long sleeves and narrow waists or – in the case of Kena – broad shoulders.
The company believes that children don't like their dolls having their sex standards set, and some parents and feminists are convinced that toys made with a view to specific sex inhibit girls' ambitions and strengthen traditional stereotypes.
"New dolls will allow all children to feel free," says Mattel.
Ms. Barbie, who appeared on the market in 1959 in the bathroom and high-end shoes, was in the past repeatedly criticised for the promotion of "unhealthy female stereotypes", such as the unnatural proportion of the body.
The group has responded to criticism and has already placed dolls on the market with different skin colors, as well as more circular shapes.
There were also hidjabe dolls.
Zandberg: near or club Together can have a couple of letters
Zandberg asked for ZET radio , how many candidates of his party can get to the Sejm from the list of left groups (KW SLD from which the list starts candidates to the SLD, Spring and Levicy Together, starting with the common logo "Lewica"), responded that this depends on the outcome of the committee.
"I believe that the results of Levica will be very good, because we feel that people are bound by the hope that Levica is not only right, but also has power," he said.
According to Zandberg, the left may have 60-80 ambassadors.
“This may mean that either the club or the club together will have several hundred ambassadors.
But it depends on Poles and Poles.
I'm not gonna talk about it and tell you how it's going to happen," he said.
Asked if Levica together would have a separate circle, Zandberg refused: “We are agreed that we are different, and we will not pretend that there is no such diversity.
I think this diversity has been rewarded by the Polish because we have shown that, by different means, we have been able to deal with the common programme."
Asked whether the biggest beneficiary of the joint start is SLD leader Vladzimir Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that he thought the biggest beneficiaries were central and left-wing voters.
In view of the fact that this SLD will receive the full grant, he refused that "the political party's goal is to represent its electors".
Zandberg admitted that in the Sejm elections, he was voting against himself.
In the case of elections to the Senate, he said he was wondering.
"The offer is diverse and in this offer there are candidates and candidates to which my heart is closer, but there are also those to which my heart is further", he said.
"I say, however, very frankly and clearly that if I found myself in circle 44, I would take an election statement and vote in another circle," he stressed.
"I don't think I would try to vote on the Minister of Vehicle Kazimierz (KO-PAP candidate)," he added.
In this district, the leader of the People of the RP Paweł Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS are launched outside the Vehicle.
Dakar: The biggest match opened in West Africa
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday for the inauguration of the huge mosque, which is considered the largest in West Africa.
The Muslims arrived by bus, car and foot to the Bopp district, where a new match could accommodate 30,000 faithful ones.
The object was built by the brotherhood of Mouride, which belongs to the Sufi nurturing of Islam, which dominates Senegal.
The work on the match began ten years ago in a subterranean area of six hectares, passed by the government.
The name of the mosque of Massalicul Jinan ("The Path to Paradise") comes from the title of the poem Ahmado Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the brotherhood, honored by the students as saints.
The brand is covered with a career marble and has five minarets.
The tallest of them is 78 meters.
The sword is in the midst of 15,000 faithful ones, and the other one can be on the outside.
In rich finished interiors, you can admire the decorated dome, giant gyrandales and handmade decorations by workers from Morocco.
The builders claim that the match is the largest in West Africa, but there is no comparison between the match in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassana II match in Casablanca can accommodate 105 thousand faithful.
The building of the facility, which cost more than EUR 30 million, was financed from private donations.
The government, in addition to the land, has set up lighting, sanitary equipment and financed road work worth EUR 10.5 million.
Trainer Smile: Our problem is not Słęsk, just us ourselves
The pass of eight league games without winning the Corona football will try to break off in a Friday meeting with the Vice-Chairman extraclass.
"Our problem is not to celebrate, but only us, we have to work on what we play," stressed the coach of the quantity Mirosław Smile.
The last and as so far as the only victory in the people was recorded in the first row, when the 1:0 benamin was played by the frequent cancers on their way out.
Later, the count recorded two remissions and six defeats, and on Tuesday, they lost 0:1 with Lubin in the 1/32 finals of the Polish Pucharu.
“I am touched by the optimism that in the last few seconds, the football players were fighting for the gate, trying to get rid of it.
Their fall on the wall after the last whistle was not due to a break, but it was a fall of anger because they were so close," said Smile.
As he pointed out, Słąsk has very strong wings, which is why he will feel the team at the side of the boxing industry.
"We are aware of the opponent's quality, but we also look at what we want to play," the coach added.
In the fifth match in the Crown, there will certainly be no pause for too many yellow cards of Fire Gnjatic, and there will also be no conjugated Jacob Žubrowski and Michael Gardowski.
The building is to report to the match of a few players who want to play.
"We have headaches, it has recently seemed that he will not, and now he is," said Smile.
Defender Corony Daniel Dziwniel stressed that Słąsk would not be an easy match for breaking the eight league leagues' track without winning, but in an extraclass everyone can win with each one.
"We're a good team.
In the last few weeks, we may not show this in the fight, but the moment will come that we will win and believe that it will be Friday," the baller pointed out.
After nine rows of Corona extraclasses with a five-point pocket, it takes 15 positions.
The spleen has gathered about 12 more and it's in a different place.
The fifth match in Kielcach will begin at 8:30 p.m.
These trees can disappear completely from Europe
"42% of the tree species in Europe are at risk", warns the International Union for Nature Protection (IUCN) in a Friday 'Red Paper of European Trees'.
There are, among other things, cassettes and javelins on the front of the list.
IUCN, an organisation based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered species of European trees for the first time.
It was prepared by experts who, on the basis of the studies, concluded that 42% of the 454 species of trees in Europe (and elsewhere in the world) are "highly endangered".
Among the reasons the Red Paper shares the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, these trees and plants are most at risk, which occur only or mainly on our continent.
In the case of typically European woodland, according to IUCN experts, 58 per cent of the species are threatened, and 15 per cent, i.e. 66 species of trees and plants, are threatened with extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation The Red Paper deals with errors in the exploitation of woodland, accelerated urbanisation, too intensive the root of trees, and further the fire of forests and the changes emerging in the European ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of herbs, flies and vegetables is also highly endangered.
"The consequences of human activity lead to a gradual disappearance of European plant species and create a danger to the extinction of important and underestimated varieties in Europe, which form the basis of European ecosystems and have an impact on the health of our planet," said the report Luc Bas, which heads the European IUCN office.
Grzegorz Schetyna: No accommodation 600+
"Today, PiS wants to buy Polaków, offering them a loan that will have to pay for the next generation," says Grzegorz Schetyna in the interview for "Rzeczpospolitj".
In his opinion, "the entire PiS policy is pic".
At the same time, politicians promise that "what is given will not be forbidden".
The Shetina ensures in her conversation with Jack Nizinkiewicz that she has an idea of defeating the law and justice.
It's about mobilizing the electorate at the polling stations.
In his view, the opposition has more potential in this regard than the Kaczyn party.
"Today, the people who are conscious who want to live in a normal state are more than the supporters of the PiS, a party that has been mistrusted by the voting values, such as modesty, humility, transparency," says Shetina.
The leader of the Civilian Coalition and the President of the Civilian Platform also noted the fundamental foundations of the KO electoral programme.
"First of all, nothing will be taken, but the direction to the future needs to be set, because the PiS is only taking care of the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, even if it is a dramaticly low investment," he said.
Secondly, it concerns "the energy consumption of Polish, aid and investment in those who really work - and those who are entrepreneurs".
Shetina explains that the KO program included a project that gives Poland at least 614 gold per hand and more gold per hand – also after several hundred.
The politician also said he didn't want to race for divorce.
As he said, he will do as much as he can, but he doesn't promise 600+.
"I will never allow the Greek option, where the leaders have objected to the opposition to redundancy, until the end of the country's financial collapse," he stressed.
The report on "Rz" also stated that Jarosław Kaczynski and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Malgorzat Kidawa-Blonski.
"We would condemn their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
“The dog walks before the fall.
Kaczynski is a man of state like Banas is crystalline," he added.
Leader PO also said that he has not yet decided whether to apply for the presidency of the Platform.
Argentina: Six dead large condors
In the Argentine province of Santa Cruz there were six dead large condors – reports TVN24.
Experts believe that human activity has contributed to their deaths.
The great condors were probably poisoned by means of the killing of predators such as pumas, foxes or wild dogs.
The animals could eat toxic waste.
Besides one young person, the rest of the dead condors were grown up.
“This is a great loss for the environment, because the condor has to reach 10-15 years to become fertile and capable of reproduction.
So we lose a protected species, a endangered species," says Luis Jamese, director of the BioAndina Foundation, a Argentine environmental organisation.
"I think that the use of toxic substances and poisons affects not only this species at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health," he adds.
“Rz”: They want a nickname for the president
They've been working on the recognition of the head of the expensive chain.
The idea was supported by Andrzej Dudy’s office – we read in "Rzeczpospolitj".
According to the newspaper, it is the gold chain of the Order of the White Eagle, a royal badge officially called the intermilitary jewel of the Rzečípospolit.
The last time he was probably used by President Ignacy Mištsky.
"Rz" says that soon such a chain can hit Andrzej Dudy's shoulder.
The Senate Human Rights, Justice and Petitions Commission has voted in favour of a proposal for a new law on orders and designations to restore them.
The newspaper says it's not the first attempt to restore this chain to the state.
The Senate has already proposed this amendment in 1992, but it has failed by one vote.
This time, the work is brilliant.
At the beginning of August, the senators devoted a few minutes to this matter, recognizing that they would have the opinion of the President's Office.
She arrived in the middle of September.
"I inform you that the Office of the President of the RP does not give any attention to the position presented in this petition," President Andrzej Dera wrote.
In the middle of the case, the Senate commission continued and again devoted little time.
"The President's office replied briefly: it is for this to be restored," said the chief of commission Robert Mamutov of PiS quoted by "Rz".
He tabled a proposal for legislative work, which the Commission supported.
Cops will teach drivers how to drive by crossing
The police action will be conducted, among other things, at the crossroads of Al. Tieplinski from Al. Pilsudski.
There is little connection between the recent complaints by the city authorities to drivers who are not always able to maintain proper cross-border behaviour.
On Friday, September 27th, the police are launching preventive actions in the Transmissible Crossroads.
It is about eliminating traffic difficulties: going to crossroads without getting out, not using light signals or road signs.
"We often think that we are alone at the crossroads, and so we really make life difficult for other drivers," said Marek Ustrobinski, the vice president of the city a few days ago.
His words sparked the press conference, at which the city authorities presented examples of inappropriate movement of cars after crossings, resulting in shocks.
At that time, the president called on travellers to reason on the road, including faster movement in the lights or not writing texts during the ride.
The topic has been taken up by the Soviet policemen, who have been launching the Action on Crossroads since today.
What's the matter?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the occurrence of a restriction on the cross-roads by drivers driving on them without the possibility of continuing the ride.
It is a frequent exaggeration that contributes to exacerbation of the difficulty in moving and creating the corks.
It is threatened with a mandate of 300 zł and 2 punishments.
In addition, the uniforms will pay attention to the non-use of light signals or road signs and incorrect parking in the intersection area.
They will also observe a lack of fluidity of the drive, late movement below the signalers, free passage of crossings, and too much distance between vehicles.
What intersections will take place?
M.in on Lisa-Kuli ul. from Jagiellońska; al. Cieplišniski from al. Pilsudski; Targów ul. from al. Pilsudski; Plac řenaviti from ul. Dębrowski or ul. Hetmanski from al. Povestančów Warsaw.
This type of shares in the capital of Podkarpacia will be held next Friday October.
They checked the company's waste disposal company from "Czejka"
"The officials of the Department of Environmental Protection of the University of Wroomin and the Environmental Inspection of the Construction Supervisory have checked the plant in the municipality of Zielonka, where waste from the "Czajka" sewage treatment plant is used in Warsaw on Friday," said the spokesman for the Vroominian Ages Karol Szyszko.
The inspectors of the Roman Empire carried out controls at a plant located in the forests of the municipality of Zielonka.
The "Dar-Trans" Private Trade and Transport Facility, under the agreement with the civil cleaning of the "Czajka" liquids, carries out waste management services.
"The installation was carried out, and the operator was also asked to provide documentation related to his activities," Szyszko said.
He added that the post-control report will be transmitted to, among other things, the Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw.
The last check in Dar-Transie was carried out by the Forest Inspectorate of Environmental Protection in Warsaw from 29 December 2015 to 11 February 2016.
It was found, however, that the company did not collect samples, measurements and soil water tests, nor did it have the results of studies of stabilised municipal sewage plants from the "Chajka" sewage treatment plant.
Following the monitoring of the WIPO, Darius Sobota was called upon to stop violating the conditions of the decision.
The private business transport company "DAR-TRANS" Darius Saturday is one of the companies that collect waste in the form of stabilised municipal sewage deposits from the clean-up plant "Chajka".
According to the decision to use waste in the production area, in the forests around the Greens, waste is processed by weight up to 60,000 tonnes a year.
The Warsaw City Water and sewerage Company reported last Thursday that on November and December 2018, STUOS was disabled, which was linked to the damage of one of the combustion plants.
As MPWik reported, their monthly export cost is 1.7 million zł (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
The Lech Wałusa supported the Malgorzata Kidada-Blonyan.
"You have taken on a difficult task, you can count on my full support," Lech Wałęs said to Malgorzata Kidawy-Blonski on Friday.
"Mr. President, this is a very important word for me," replied the candidate of the Civilian Coalition to the Prime Minister, the leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that as far as the situation in Poland is concerned, it is now "only a kibik on retirement".
Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonska met with former President Lech Walęsa at his office at the Gdańsk European Solidarity Centre on Friday.
In a short conversation behind the closed doors, the son of Wałęsa — Jarosław — also took part.
"You took on a difficult task," he said after the meeting of Lech Wałęs.
"You can count on my total support," he added.
“The problems facing Poland are known to us all.
That is why it is a great hope that you, as a woman, will deal with these problems, and all of us – those who love Poland – will be able to fully support your actions," the president said, addressing the Kidawa-Blonski.
Very Important Words
Kidawa-Blonska thanked you for your support.
"Mr President, it is very important to me because no one, like you, can talk about freedom, about constitutions and knows what this is about," she said.
"Let us show that we can do another, wise policy, together, but according to the constitution, according to the law, according to respect for others.
That's how you did your revolution, and that's how we want to change Poland," Kidawa-Blonski stressed.
Kibic on retirement
Wałåsa, in his interview with the journalists, said that he is now "only a kibik on retirement".
"Of course I look at it.
I hope we reverse the course of events, that what was good, proven, will be returned.
The threefolding of power is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are necessarily needed.
And that's all we have to clean up, that's all we need to get back to normal, and I believe we're doing it this time.
'Cause if not, we're waiting for a street criterion," Lech Wałuss said.
"That is why it is so important for the Polish to go to the elections, decide and decide on their own.
And that's the most important thing," Kidawa-Blonski gave up.
"Last chance we'll improve the status of things in Poland," the former president replied.
"We need to build on a new foundation"
Asked about the most important changes to be made to Poland, Kidawa-Blonski said: "The President said very well.
We need to build on a new foundation on which we can do all the other things.
If there is no trifle of power, if the constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and lead it to become clear and all know that otherwise Poland will not move forward."

The Senate decided on key laws
The Senate adopted without amendment the Act on the disclosure of the property of the most important civil servants and the flights of the most important persons in the country.
The new law on the property of civil servants – without amendment – voted 52 senators, 14 opposed, three abstained from voting.
The same senators decided to reject the 12 amendments tabled during the mid-term debate by Senator PO Sławmir Rybicki.
According to the amendment, they had the law to "civilize" and to limit the scope of information given in the statement of the situation of their own children, the children of their spouse, the children of children adapted to cases where children remain in the common household with the person obliged to make the statement.
The Act on the Publicity of the Family of the Chief State Officers, whose project was established in the Prime Minister's office, was adopted by Sejm on 11 September.
The provisions require that, inter alia, the ministers, ministers, ambassadors, MEPs, senators, presidents: the Constitutional Court, the Chief Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as those in charge of other State institutions, will be obliged to place property information on the property of the spouses, children and persons remaining in common interest.
The Senate also did not propose an amendment to the Aviation Act of the most important persons in the country.
It regulates which flights have the status of HEAD and who can be on board government aircraft with the most important persons in the country.
The Act also specifies who is responsible for the conduct of the Central Register of Flights.
According to the law – without amendment – 55 senators spoke out, 12 opposed, four abstained from the vote.
In accordance with the law, each flight of the President will be a flight "in the official mission".
Members of the family and others invited by the President will be able to accompany the President in the flights.
Instead, the flight in the official mission of the Prime Minister and the marshals of Sejm and the Senate will only be "responsible for the performance of tasks directly related to the full function".
The Act also specifies the list of persons who can accompany the most important persons in the country during the flight.
Members of delegations may be invited, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts on board the aircraft; persons providing technical, medical or organisational services; and journalists.
According to the law, if there is doubts about the pilots of the Sejm and the Senate, the head of the KPRM will explain them.
If such doubts are not clarified within a specified time, the Head of the KPRM will be required to notify the Chief of the Sejm Office or the Senate of the lack of the possibility of organising such a flight.

It was loud about their troubles on the trip to this one.
This time, without such problems, they met with the Slovaks on Friday morning in the charter to Paris, and a few hours later they had training in the famous Bercy hall.
According to the relationship between the people present in the class, the world’s champions were undernourished.
As assistant Heynen Michał Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not the exercise of sitar elements itself.
“We went to the hall, but in most cases it was time for the team.
It was about spending more time together than training.
Talk, think about how to rebuild it as a team," he said.
He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the racers and the training staff.
"We were brutally brought to the ground.
Without two words, we're disappointed.
We still believed we'd get back to this game.
We were discussing this game with each other at the station, the coach talked a lot to the contestants.
As two main causes of failure, I would indicate inability in the attack and much worse than usually meeting with the situational balls.
The Slovenians were much better than we," he said.
In his view, "White-Red" did not prevent the stress associated with the speech against supported by the loud and numerous public co-sponsorships of the tournament.
He admitted that the world's champions could sleep a little smooth way to the semifinal.
"Perhaps if we had a similar failure in the group phase, we would be faster to analyze this lesson and later to play in the further phase of the tournament.
But it's just fucking," he warned.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with Poland's Thursday defeat will be overcome by aggression in the brown game.
"I hope that we will then show our true faces.
There's nothing to fight about.
The last ME medal we fired in 2011," he recalled.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by Polish during these championships.
In the group phase they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, at the first two meetings of the group phase they met in Apeldoorn, and at the semi-final they moved to Ljubljana.
Nick Kyrgios: cruel punishment, but suspended
Australian tennis player received a 16-week start ban and a fine of $25,000 - a half-year suspension - for forced words, gestures and acts during the last ATP tournaments.
The ATP World Tour operators are losing patience with Kyrgyz, but they still give him a chance to improve.
The summary of the results of the most unaccompanied professional tennis player in recent years seems dangerous – 16 weeks of break plus a lot of crime, but both penalties are suspended for half a year – a trial period in which the football sportsman can improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but has been working out for a long time and has earned his own tennis record in the world – he had to pay the highest in the history of discipline a single financial penalty for breaking the rules of behavior on and next to him.
Voice curses, strange gestures, non-sport behaviour, injury to the judge and the sights, breaking two rockets during a lost match with Karen Chačanov – all for this after the August ATP Masters 1000 tour in Cincinnati paid $113 thousand.
In the US Open 2019, he did not play for long, but was able to publicly say that ATP operators "are corrupt", which hurt the organization's authorities so much that they conducted a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgyz and, after a couple of weeks, they gave the above-mentioned warrants to suspend the start-up and further punishment.
However, the word about corruption has been forgiven, after hearing the accused and knowing the context of the statement.
However, in the reasoning to the tennis industry, the investigation showed that Kyrgyz’s behaviour over the last 12 months has in many cases raised serious reservations and constituted almost continuous violations of the rules that he has been injuring, without a break, the Vulgate person associated with the tournaments and the sights, from which there is a high penalty.
The ATP, however, gave him five days to appeal and immediately dismissed the verdict, ordering the execution within the next six months of several conditions: in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios tournaments, no longer can violate the rules of the Code of Conduct of Professional Tennisists, in particular, no longer be allowed to curse, destroy the rockets, fight with judges and the public, nor can any other way of acting unfavorably and vulgarly.
He also received a recommendation to seek "continuous support" from mental coaches during the tournaments and also outside the season to consult with people specialising in solving sportsmen's problems without proper behaviour.
Nick Kyrgyz’s first comment (in social media) was as follows: “Hey, everybody, I can still play.
I just need to control my behavior, that's all."
In practice, the Australian will have at least a two-week break, since in Puchars Lavera, he had to stop at the nearest start in Beijing (30 September – 6 October) and Shanghai (6-13 October).
The ATP Kyrgyos ranking takes 27th place.
This year, he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, earned over 1.3 million dollars, so even after the war, he will have a lot to do.
GUS: Poland is getting better
The report published by the GUS on the budgets of households, published on Friday, shows that as a good or rather good estimate of its material situation, up to 44% of them.
The previous year was 37.2%, in 2016 33.5%, and earlier, since 2009, when the statistical authority first examined the subjective estimates of the situation of households, it never exceeded 30%.
Its material situation was considered to be bad or rather bad by 8.1% of households, compared to 11.2% of the year before and more than 20% in 2009.
The material situation of households of people working on their own account is best.
In this group, it is considered to be good or rather good by 70% of respondents.
In the second run, there are households of pensioners, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.
The number of children also has a significant impact on the subjective assessment of the material situation of households.
The worst is known to parents who are self-educated offspring, including a good or rather good material situation, 32%.
Among couples with children, this percentage (depending on the number of children) varies from 55% to 60% and among homeless households is 48.8%.
These statistics clearly show the effect of the 500+ programme.
Before being launched (in 2016) the worst material situation was assessed by single parents of offspring and multiple families (with at least three children).
Improving the subjective assessment of the material situation of Poland is a reflection of the rapid growth of income, especially from work.
This is not all, however, because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good increases faster than real income.
Moreover, there is no clear link between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of the households.
The best estimates are made by the inhabitants of the Polish Voivodeship, where they consider their situation to be good or rather good 48.9% of the population.
In addition, there are Ljubus voivodships (47.7%), Ljuske (47.6%), Mazowiski (47.3%) and West Pomerania (47.1%).
Meanwhile, in Opolska, the regulatory income (i.e. after tax payments and contributions) was 94% of the national average and 98% of Lubuska.
The highest income was from the people of Mazowiecki (120% of the national average) and Silesia (104%).
On average, in Poland, the administrative income per person amounted to EUR 1693 per person in 2018.
In real terms (as adjusted by price change) the rate increased by 4.3% in 2017.
In the past few years, this has turned out to be quite low.
In 2016, income per person increased by 7% and by 6.3% later.
Although income growth slows down, it also inhibits expenditure growth.
These were calculated per person in sub.r. 1187 zł, which means that in real terms they were reduced by 0.7%.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure per person increased by 1.9% and in 2016 by 4.3%.
Studies in household budgets suggest that the domestic statistical economy currently spends 70.1% of its regulatory revenues, while that share still exceeded 80% in 2014, and by 2006 it exceeded 90%.

USA: Three suicides among the airline crew
Three sailors committed suicide last week on board USS George H. W. Bush – the American Navy reported.
In the last two years, in total, five members of the crew of this ship have been killed.
The previous suicide took place in July of this year, and earlier in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors were shot last week.
Every one of the events happened on the ground when the USS George H. W. Bush dug up on the coast of Virginia.
As so far, the participation of third parties has been excluded.
Moreover, death is not supposed to be connected.
“We need everyone to get involved in presenting suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent another suicide.
I would like to stress that there is no stigmatization or other impact on the search for help," said Captain Sean Bailey, captain of the ship on Facebook.
It's very critical of the pope.
John Paul II didn't do anything
In his discussion with Peter Lekszyk Stefan Niesiolovski, he stressed that in 1981 John Paul II was a huge authority for opposition activists.
‘In fact, all of his opinions were accepted.’
Later, a criticism of some of his actions appeared.
“For me, John Paul II could not eliminate the harmful activity of Rydzky, it is a great appreciation for his pontificacy.
On the other hand, the Redemptorist – the harmor of the Church and Poland – developed his media in the best way for the life of Pope Polaka," he explained.
The PO said: “There was a dissatisfaction, and the pope said something he had never accepted, but he had the authority and politics to simply throw him out of the church or send him to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not do so, like his followers," Niesiolovski explained.
“In addition, this fatal cause of paedophilia and Church activities has been achieved, and indeed their absence.
I ran a little ahead of me, but I wanted to pay attention to the entire shape of his life.
We've known about the scale of pedophilia in the Church since relatively recently.
There is a question as to how it is possible that John Paul II, as head of the Church, did not know of these disgusting things," says Niesiolovski journalist.
In the assessment of the former PO policy, the Church is an associate of the PIS.
“It must be acknowledged that during the period of Solidarity the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations began from the sacred mass, and the cross was hanging all over.
Now these crosses are written, become a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the written regime.
I repeat: one of the most unpleasant surprises is that such people as Rydzik shake the Polish Church that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of the PiS.
This is the black chapter of the Polish Church, for which the island will pay him," Nesiolovski convinced.
"I hope that the Pope of France drives the Adriatic, Riddish and a few others of this kind," he said.

D-Bus Call Failed
The old Pukharu Polski between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk with a small hair did not end tragically when the wibs of the Wejher Rac with millimetres passed by the team's opponent, Zlatana Alomerovici.
After this incident, the game was interrupted for 20 minutes.
This case was investigated by the PZPN Commission, and the Gryfovs had a severe punishment, excluding it from future games.
The club will not be able to start in the Polish Pucharze in the 2020/2021 season.
In addition, the kibbies will not be released in the nearest match at their own stadium.
They will also not be able to go to leagues until 31 December.
Burds at the Vidzev Łódź stadium also called the Člęska Wrocław kibika.
However, the decision of the PZPN was easier because Slovakia had prevented such events from happening and felt the appropriate authorities in this regard.
However, the services have allowed the industry to be tainted by the cyclists, the heating of chairs and the economic sector to be forced.
This game was suspended for eight minutes, and the interfering police had to use the watercraft.
PZPN imposed a one-time stadium ban in the closest match in Pucharze Polski and banned the organisation of the matches in this and the next edition of the PP.
The ban on departures also covered the League Extraclasses, but it will last until December 31.
Foreign names of cities on road signs also in Poland
DGDKiA plans to exchange the label on the entire managed network of roads by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Reese
In Podcarpaci, the implementation of a new regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on the storage of foreign names on road signs also began after Poland.
For example, "Lows" will appear next to "L'viv".
In our village, changes will be made to 94 road signs set at A4 motorways and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it's supposed to be easier, easier and easier.
The new guidelines result from the updating of the Minister of Infrastructure Regulation on specific technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
"We should remember that local names in neighbouring countries are often also Polish.
Thanks to the changes that we have prepared, they will finally appear on the roadside.
The introduction of a new label begins with the sub-carpack section of the A4 motorway," the Infrastructure Minister Andrzej Adamczyk informed.
There will be 94 road signs set at A4 motorways and national roads: DK19, DK94.
The total investment cost?
200 thousand zł.
In the first order, the new label will be implemented on motorway A4, which is scheduled for 1 November 2019.
How's the idea going to look?
It's going to go without changing the plates, basically.
They will replace the existing local names with new ones written in Polish on existing marks.
Both names will be written in one line – in the first order after Poland and then in the original, in the poem.
This will be a great relief for people who do not know the written names of foreign cities in the country where they are located.

Someone shot the windshields.
In the state of Zamec in Lower Silesia, the inhabitants noticed the weaknesses of the wing problems.
After catching and visiting the veterinarian, it turned out that someone had set a target for the animal – in his body, the windshield was found.
“The information on the bird was received from the residents of the Wild Animal Rehabilitation Centre in New Sole.
The report showed that the animal had broken wings.
We made it to the place.
It was right now that something was wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely so that we would not hurt him or affect his extra stress.
The boat was caught and put into the vet.
After the first picture of RTG it was known that someone had made a shot of him.
In his body there were fractures," says Marcin Walasek, president of Malpol, who manages the rehabilitation centre.
Translucent in the center
"The mornings have been cleaned, the birds have been given antibiotics, access to water, a safe place in the center where they spend the whole winter.
We're trying to strengthen him.
He can't fly right now.
The release would now be linked to the likely failure of winter," Walasek adds.
The staff, after being rehabilitated, intend to release him for spring to the same estate.
After receiving information on the cause of the animal health condition, the authorities of the municipality of Zukowice intend to inform the prosecutor.

Gowin: "We need to encourage Polish, small trade"
"The effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of retail trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the State has any instruments to encourage Polish trade," said the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Jarosław Gowin Agreement on Friday.
Gowin, during the "Day Signals" interview in Radio Unit, found that trade is being developed by international networks that throw so low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot actually develop.
Given that it is very difficult to fight this problem, the Deputy Prime Minister recalled that the PiS government was trying to measure it at the very beginning of the term of office, but was given "the opposite of the KE".
"We have won the Court of Justice and I hope that if the United Law wins the closest elections and forms the government, we will return to this issue," he said.
At the same time, he noted that "the effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the Polish problem, so small trade".
"It will now be necessary to decide whether the government has any instruments to encourage Polish trade," Gowin said.
In May, the EU court found that the European Commission made a mistake in recognizing that Polish retail tax was not permitted by public aid.
The Retail Tax Act introduced two rates of trade tax: 0.8% from income between 17 million zł and 170 million zł monthly and 1.4% from income above 170 million zł monthly.
The tax has been in force since September 2016.
In September 2016, the EC initiated a infringement procedure for EU law by Poland.
Brussels argued then that the tax structure could favour smaller shops, which could be regarded as public aid.
It subsequently found that the tax had been imposed in an inconsistencies with the law.
It also ordered that the tax be suspended until its analysis was completed by the officials in Brussels.
Poland did not agree to this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The May decision of the EU court opened the way for the reintroduction of the tax, but did not end the case.
On 24 July the Commission brought an appeal before the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the TEU Press Service informed the PAP that the case is now at a written stage, in which both the European Commission and the Polish Government present their arguments in writing.
At the moment, it is not known whether or not the oral procedure is in motion, namely hearing of the parties and any report.
It takes a good couple of months to make a decision.
"This procedure lasts for an average year," said the PAP source of the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
How do you get the baby to be baptized?
Let us consider a few practical solutions.
Baptism is an extremely important Christmas in the life of the infant and his parents.
It is often the first time that the entire family is focused around the child, celebrating its appearance in the world together.
It's no wonder, then, that freshly baked mom and dad want their comfort to look as good as that day.
Before you make a final decision about your child’s machine, however, think about whether or not it will be convenient.
In stores you can find many machine kits that do not provide small appropriate comfort.
So what should you pay attention to?
The basic criterion of selection for baptism is the age of the child
Recently, several-year-old babies were baptized, arranged in white sets, and inserted into the same bees or large swellings.
Today, children attending the funeral are often older: a few months, a few months, and even older.
It's not hard to imagine that such a great comfort needs something else to be baptized.
Therefore, if your child on the day of baptism has 3-4 months, a certain ceremony will take place in the carriage or in the hands of parents or Christians.
The best way to go is to put it in a comfortable, cottony bed or a set.
Although this wardrobe element is considered to be a daily supply, it is enough to search for its excellent options, such as a falbank or a crown.
For the boy, perfect points are displayed with the printing of the muscles and the stems.
In the case of older children, you may be allowed to have a greater fantasy in the closet.
A girl will look pretty in a simple, tiuli dress
Many parents of girls with disabilities look at the rich, falbanian dresses on the cross in a set of plazas, monkeys and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of producers use artificial, non-rehaling materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
Looking for the appropriate clothing will better look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant machines on cotton underwear.
The delicate, tiulis, satin dresses, crowns, apps and charming kits will make your daughter look beautiful and comfortable.
Ideal suit for a small gentleman: cotton suit
Until recently, there was a fashion on clothing that was a copy of the "adult" models.
Polyester sailors and lower, rigid collages or caskets often made young elegant ones show their dissatisfaction.
Luckily, today they were separated by comfortable, cottony kits.
Just look at the kits available in Asanti for Kids, that is, soft, hairy underwear, and the shirt is decorated from the front to the shirt pattern.
These machines look extremely remarkable, but at the same time they don't touch the movements of the little world.
Kristina Pavłowicz published a statement
Kristina Pawłowic made a statement at the end of her term of office.
As a result, the PiS sent 110,000 bad savings.
Let's remember that Paulowic ordered his withdrawal from politics.
At the end of his term of office, he has an amount of 110 thousand zł
As a result of the statement made by the letter, it takes a monthly pension of 4,7 thousand dollars.
Pavlović has an apartment worth 570 thousand zł and a little less that he rents, taking 880 zła per month.
The mission also invests in industrial metals, assessing the investment of 150 thousand zł.
Earlier, Jarosław Kaczyński also published the statement of assets.
Voting on the suspension in proceedings during the Conference of the Conservative Party
The British parliamentarians voted against a three-day break in the proceedings of the Gmin Chamber for the annual programme conference of the Conservative Party, which the government has referred to.
289 sent out against 306.
Usually, the Gmin Chamber does not discuss during the parties' conferences, so that the Members do not have to give up their participation in them or in parliamentary meetings.
However, the opposition parties considered that, in such a crucial time as the last weeks before the British withdrawal from the European Union scheduled for 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt the debate.
At the request of the Government, 289 sent an appeal against 306.
Two opposition parties already after the Conventions
The absence of a suspension may be taken as a political revenge against the opposition to the Boris Johnson Prime Minister for his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday the decision was recognised by the Supreme Court as inconsistencies with law and non-conformity) and for the fact that the judges do not wish to apologize for it.
After that decision, the Gmin Chamber resumed the session, and the most important event of the day was the performance of Johnson and the ensuing heated debate.
Johnson accused the opposition of blocking the brexit and avoiding the preliminary elections.
“The time has come to realize the brexit.
It needs to be done to respect the outcome of the referendum.
Brexit must come so that we can deal with the citizens' priorities, the health service, the cost of life.
Brexit needs to be realized so that we can unite this country," Johnson said.
The Conservative Party Conference will begin in Manchester next Sunday and take place on Wednesday 2 October.
The two main opposition groups, the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats, have already been held.
One of the reasons that Johnson gave, explaining the long suspension of Parliament, was the fact that it was a party conference.
Media: Andrzej Dude accuses Israel of anti-chemical attacks in Poland
"President Andrzej Duda believes that the anti-chemical attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders," says foreign media.
The President's spokesman strongly deplored these reports.
"It's just not true," he wrote on Twitter.
Israeli media, including "Haaretz" and "Jerusalem Post", referring to "Jewish Insider", writes that Andrzej Duda, when meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora in the Soviet Consulate in New York, said that Israel is responsible for the recent anti-chemical attacks in Poland.
The president said that the increase in the anti-Semitic attacks in Poland is a reaction to the Israeli leaders' rhetoric.
He referred to the words of Israel's foreign minister, Israel Katza, who said in February that "Polish sent an anti-Semitism with mother's milk".
Andrzej Duda said he regrets Israel's not apologizing for rejecting his policies.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish ambassador to Israel, Mark Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by a rapist who shouted, "Polac, Polak."
‘The quote is not only inaccurate.
It's just not true," he wrote on Twitter.
He stressed that Duda "never said that Israel is responsible for the last anti-chemical attacks in Poland".
According to the Spyhal portal, "this is what he invented."
According to speakers "JI" at the meeting, there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivors, marked by the Commandary Cross of Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was to agree with President Dudy's words and say that Jews from Israel "are responsible for the growth of anti-Semitism.
According to the source of the Boteach portal, he was going to interrupt Mosberg's speech.
Who's Banas and what's he guilty of?
The stone mine rented by the builders led the journalist to discover neglect in Marian Banasia's property statements.
We're summarizing another affair that has shaken the government's camp.
TVN journalist Marian Banasz, president of the Supreme Control Chamber, has not reported in recent years on the statement of a 400-metre property stone that is located on the Krakow Podhorz.
More than that, his tenant had in that rock sexbiznes (and thus renting rooms for hours).
In turn, the building has been declared to have secured the payment of the loan since 2016.
Bertold Kittel pointed out the irregularities in the Supervision program.
The journalist revealed that people associated with the criminal world rented a stone from Banasi to use it as a place of "erotic meetings".
Clients were supposed to be men using prostitute services.
On the charge of Banas, he answered inadvertently and inadvertently.
What's interesting, rented by the stonekeepers, led the journalist to discover neglect in Banasia's property statements.
The stone itself was in them because it was described as unclear, and the income from the rent was to be reduced.
“The mother of Mariana Banasia and his wife may be worth between 6 million and 8 million dollars.
In total, married couples can boast of two homes, three apartments, savings[...]", writes Money.pl.
And as a result of the portal analysis, Banasi's stone was worth about 3 million dollars.
The Central Anti-Corruption Office is currently monitoring Marian Banasi's property statements from 2015 to 2019.
Banas said he would suspend his activities in NIC by the time it was finished. "I will join you in a free leave march," he assured.
The opposition demands clarification.
"We do not hear that the CBA has expanded its investigation or has accelerated the investigation of the claims made by Marian Banasia.
Therefore, we are forced to order the state authorities and to report on the possibility of committing a crime [...]", said PO-KO Mr Witczak.
"If the normal Polak had been so low in terms of renting its properties, he would already have 10 controls, a tax department and a carnival procedure," he added.
He went high, he fell low
Marian Banasz is the new president of the Supreme Chamber of Control.
This position was called on 30 August 2019 for a 6-year term.
His candidacy was declared by the Law and Justice and the votes of the politicians of the party.
Banash was previously associated with NIC in 1992-2005, acting in this institution as a co-worker of Lech Kaczynski.
During the first governments of PiS (2005-2008), Banas was the President of the Customs Service and also the Under-Secretary of State of the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015, he has been re-chairing the Chief of the Customs Service and has been managing the National Treasury since 2017.
Banas has served three months as Minister of Finance in the government of Mateus Morawiecki.

"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoring the police command will be punished
According to the newspaper, the violation of a particular order of conduct issued by the police is to be a new kind of offence, a threat of crime, a arrest or a restriction of liberty.
This is what police allies want to do.
The idea came to the Commission's summit on Petitions.
"The case is serious, because now every year more than half a million cases are brought before Polish courts," we read.
"Rzeczpospolita" has established that the request made by the Independent Police Trade Union to send for a change in the code of departure has a chance of success.
The authors of the petition propose the new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Infringement.
He would say: “Any person who does not comply with the request or order of a public official issued within the limits of the law and subject to the provisions of the law shall be liable to imprisonment, imprisonment or limitation of liberty”.
"Par. 3 of this provision speaks of an identical penalty for those who do not comply with orders which are impossible or difficult to carry out the service activity," the journal states.
Sociologist Andrzej Kowalski said "Rzeczpospolitj" that although it agrees with the main text of the proposal for a regulation, it is afraid that if it is implemented, it can be used in political demonstrations.
"In the situations of freedom demonstrations, it would be unfavourable and instead alleviate the situation rather than exacerbate it," he adds.
According to the statistics provided by the newspaper, 86% of citizens have assessed police interventions in 2018 and 1.5 million urban interventions are undertaken each month.
The storm is worried about Europe.
I'm Topol writing we have blood.
Among his predecessors are editors, interpreters, writers.
The father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important battled Czech playmakers, today listed in a row with Václav Havel.
From the beginning, therefore, the curse of the talent that this man has been trying to use.
After eight years, he returned with "A Sensitive Man".
The heroes are Buras and Sonya along with two sons, but they do not create a typical Czech family.
They're marine actors, they're traveling across Europe.
He's a lover of Shakespeare and a thief, she's a one-eyed translator who doesn't break up with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys from birth didn't make a sound, and for the second time, he stopped in childhood.
But they're not heroes, they're the most important thing in this story.
Everyone is the only one to watch a world where there is no room for artists.
It is a world of troubled provinces, societies of old, suspicious people and solved youth.
"Sensible man" places are turned into an absurd theater.
Narration follows didascalia, and the conversations of heroes create this world.
The scene is Europe is full of concern about its future, but also persistent questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to bankruptcy Thomas Cook
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook fell, his Belgian daughter Neckermann works.
But the company has problems.
As VRT TV reports, the Brussels Airlines lines have announced that they cancel 105 flights in October due to the bankruptcy problems of Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also fired 75 employees.
All departures with an office that has been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but they will be able to receive a refund in time.
The Gandawi court also announced the bankruptcy of three Belgian sugar companies: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently, about 12,000 Belgians are staying abroad on trips purchased by Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were supposed to leave with the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, spokesperson Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers said that the company is currently "full of operation" despite the announcement of bankruptcy by the British company of a mother who caused anxiety among workers and clients.
The Bureau then insisted that the customers who bought the trip in it would go on vacation.
Thomas Cook – the oldest and one of the largest travel offices in the world – announced a fall at night from Sunday to Monday.
The direct cause of bankruptcy was to break off Sunday's last chance talks with creditors and potential investors.
The creditors were required to obtain an additional 200 million as collateral for the winter period, in addition to the rescue plan already agreed in August of 900 million pounds, when the travel office usually has lower rotations.
However, the company's problems have grown over the years, with a long effect of 1.6 billion pounds.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for your opinion
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an extraordinary offer was prepared for the arrival of the German Görlitz.
The actions will help to combat the ongoing decline in the number of inhabitants of the city.
Görlitz is the most driven east of the city of Germany.
A beautiful pastel cake attracts 140 thousand tourists a year.
However, as The Guardian writes, the city is struggling with significant problems.
There are the lowest wages in Germany in Görlitz.
The city also competes with a steady population of its inhabitants.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the western part of the country, which turned into a 25% drop in the city's population.
In 2013, it accounted for 54 thousand people.
To fight the population, officials came up with the idea of starting to offer free monthly accommodation in the city.
As far as the programme is concerned, 150 applications have been made.
Two thirds of them, the inhabitants of large cities.
The program also took an interest in people from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom.
"When we applied, we thought that the program would convince people to move to Görlitz," one of the project participants said.
"Now we feel that it doesn't matter whether we stay here for four weeks or not," he added.
The city has seven thousand free apartments, and unemployment is three times higher than the average in the whole country.
Although the city authorities hope that some will be carried out on a permanent basis, the main objective of the programme is to obtain the opinion of the participants.
Information gathered from the interviews and questionnaires will help to revive smaller German cities.
"We want to learn more about what people need, and if they decide to move – what their motivation was," said Robert Knippschild.
Other cities have already experimented with the idea of evicting new residents by offering encouragement in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, who introduced a payment program promising young specialists for life and work in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy or to the American Tulsa in Oklahoma state.
