The members of the Belgian assembly are afraid that they will “seem to be Mupeti”
Some of the members of the Belgian Assembly are continuing from the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament)
For the purpose of the proposal, plans are to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the assembly, contrary to the political spectrum, are concerned that the name could lead to ridicule.
One member of the Labour Party stated that his group was concerned that "it was held with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In the realm of twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A member on the part of Plaid said that the group as a whole "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
The Dutch Conservative stated that his group was coming to change the name "in open mind", but noted that MWP was close to Muppet's word.
In this context, the English word "w" is similar to the word "u" in yorkshiri English.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is now preparing legislation to introduce amendments to the name, stated: "The final decision on what will be called the members of the Belgian assembly will, of course, be on the members themselves."
The Belgian Government's 2017 Law gave the Dutch Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on proposals, where broad support was obtained to call the assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of the meeting members, the Commission preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP option received the highest support in the public debate.
The members of the meetings clearly propose alternative options, but the fight to achieve consensus can bring the concerns of President Elin Jones, who will present a legislative proposal within a few weeks.
Reform laws will include further changes in the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the disqualification of members and the draft committee system.
The members of the assembly will vote on the question of their title in the course of the discussion of the new legislation.
Macedonians will vote on the country's name change
On Sunday, voters will decide whether their country's name will be changed to the "North Macedonian Republic".
A separate vote should resolve ten years of ongoing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long been insisting that the name of the northern neighbour represents a claim to Greek territory and repeatedly protests against the EU and NATO country membership request.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is a plebiscite's resistance to the change of name, has announced that he will not vote.
The representatives of the referendum, including the President of Zoran Zaeva, argue, however, that the change of name is simply a price for entry into the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's will be silenced because the churches in Harlem are fighting for survival
"The old people I spoke to say that there was a bar and church on every corner," says Mr. Adams.
"There's nothing there today."
He thinks the removal of bars is understandable.
"People meet today in a different way," he says.
"The bars are no longer the living room of a neighborhood where people walk regularly."
As for the churches, he is afraid that the money from the sale of the property will not be enough for as long as their representatives expect, "and sooner or later they will be exactly where they started."
As he adds, the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of people who do not help the remaining saints in the quarter.
"The simple majority of people who buy apartments in these homes will be white," he says, "and that is why the day will soon come when these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into the apartments will become members of the churches."
Both churches built white congregations even before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The original white - language Methodist congregation moved in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was taken over by the Black Congregation, whose worship was not far away.
St. Martin took over the Montenegrin Congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who stood in front of the boycotts on 125th Street, the main shopping bulwark in Harlem, who refused to hire or raise blacks.
The fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson’s soldiers planned to rebuild it, they ordered the bell tower.
Reverend David Johnson, son of the father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin, proudly called the bells of the poor.
The expert who played the soundtrack in July called it "cultural treasure" and "an irrevocable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first ringleader in the world to be played by a black singer, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to a larger ringleader in a church in Riverside.
Mr. Merriweather says that no one has ever betrayed him at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, St. Martin’s story of architects and designers, some of which have been called upon by late church representatives, and others by the episcopal diocese, has been a complicated one.
The council of elders, the head of the Farty Authority, consisting of laity representatives, sent a letter in July expressing concern that the diocese would "try to impose costs" on the council of elders, although the recruitment of architects and designers who sent the diocese did not take part.
Some Pharisees complained about insufficient transparency on the part of the diocese.
The shark injured a 13-year-old boy in California who drowned for lobsters
According to the official report, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who drowned in California for lobster on the day of the start of the lobster season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near the Beacon's Beach beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that on Saturday morning he and his friends had drowned for about half an hour when he heard the boy calling for help, and then he joined the whole group to help him pull him out of the water.
Hammel pointed out that the call was first considered to be joy from the humr catch, but then “you realized that he was shouting, ‘ Shoot me!
Shoot me!"
When Hammel got to the boy, he noticed that “he had broken the entire area of the key bone.”
"I cried that everyone would go out of the water: ‘In the water is a shark!’ says Hammel.
The boy was in critical condition transported by helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council Hospital in San Diego.
It's not known what kind of shark is behind the attack.
Dr. Larry Giles pointed out at the press conference that the shark was seen in this area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma at the top of the body.
The authorities for investigation and security closed for 48 hours access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca after Swami's in Ecinitas.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the cosmetic market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's wants to build chains Boots, SuperDrug and Debenham's cosmetic streets in the style of a business house, where specialized stores will be available.
Within a strong market with cosmetics in Great Britain, which has a value of 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household needs decline, streets with cosmetics will be tested in 11 sales throughout the country.
Investment in cosmetics is linked to the efforts of supermarkets to find use for the regimes that used previously for television, microwaves and household needs.
Sainsbury's suggests that it doubles the size of the offer of cosmetic products to 3,000 products, and first, it also mentions brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
More space will also get the current range from the L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brand because of brand places similar to those in shops like Boots.
Supermarket also again introduces its make-up Boutique range, so most products will be vegan, which young customers still require more.
In addition, in two Saintsbury’s sales it will test the concession of the retail perfume dealer Fragrance Shop. The first such trade was opened last week in Croydon in southern London and will occur next year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Buying online and moving towards daily buying a small quantity of food in local stores means that supermarkets need to make more effort to attract people.
Director-General Sainsbury's Mike Coupe says sales will continue to look more and more like business houses, because a chain of supermarkets is trying to better offer services and non-food products to combat discount sellers like Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's opened in hundreds of sales side of Argos and also introduced a number of Habitat departments, which are chains that he bought two years ago. Thanks to this increased sales of food and supplies are even more profitable.
The previous attempt to convert the department into a cosmetic and pharmaceutical range ended in vain.
At the beginning of the millennium Sainsbury’s tested a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after the dispute over the distribution of drug sales revenues in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s three years ago sold his 281 doctors for 125 million pounds of Celesio, which owns Lloyds’s network.
Lloyds has a role to play in the plan by adding a range of luxury brands to four sales including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Business director Sainsbury’s Paul Mills-Hicks says: “We have changed the view and style of the street with cosmetics to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues with whom customers will be able to consult.
Our brand range should satisfy all needs and the attractive environment and the beneficial location means that we are now a attractive place to buy cosmetics that changes the old ways of buying."
Peter Jones is "crazy" after Holly Willoughby resigned from the contract for 11 million pounds.
Star of Dragons Dan Peter Jones series "wurst" after the TV moderator Holly Willoughby retired from the contract worth $11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of household clothes and accessories Truly.
The company of this pair was compared to the Goop brand by Gwyneth Paltrov.
The seven-year-old moderator announced the departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby blew up the star of the Dragons Dan Peter Jones series by leaving their luxurious lifestyle business for the last time – to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the reported sources, Jones “suddenly” when a TV star at a busy Tuesday meeting in the centre of his business empire in Marlow in Buckinghamshire admitted that, due to new contracts, up to 1.5 million pounds, he would no longer be able to devote enough time to their home clothing and accessories.
The company was compared to the Goop brand by Gwyneth Paltrov and could double the wealth of the Willoughby moderator in the estimated value of 11 million pounds.
When a seven-year-old Willoughby on Instagram announced that True would leave, Jones went out of Britain to one of his summer seats.
The designated source states: “Truly’s daughter was a top priority for Holly.
It should have been her long-term future, which will assure her for decades ahead.
Her decision to leave was completely shocked by all the participants.
No one on Tuesday could believe what was going on, the release was so close.
In the centre of Marlow is a full stock of goods prepared for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the moderator of the series This Morning, which is one of the most profitable British stars, could make the company millions in view of the bold investment in products from pillows and candles after clothing and household clothing and the possible further delay of the marking.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willoughby and Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Cappov, for ten years.
Willoughby founded the Truly brand with Tara Capp in 2016 and 20-year-old Jones joined the presidency in March.
Couples ride together on vacation and Jones has 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is to become an M&S ambassador and replaces Anta McPartlin in moderating series I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones last night said, "We won't comment on his business."
Hard conversation "and then we fell in love"
He complained about the criticism he would get from reporters for a note that some consider to be "unsuitable president" and how he speaks positively of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump responded with his ridiculous "voice" voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that after considering their June first meeting in Singapore Trump as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea, Kim is interested in another meeting.
But the deal on the elimination of nuclear weapons hung on a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, a significant North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders on Saturday at the UN Vale Assembly that North Korea did not see a "responsible" response to its first steps towards disarmament.
Instead, the United States continues in sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump, in his speech, expressed a much more optimistic view.
"It's great with North Korea," he said.
“We were on the battlefield with North Korea.
She'd be millions of lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
His efforts to improve his relationship with Kim led to positive results – the completion of missile tests, the release of arms and the return of the rest of the American soldiers to power.
And he defended his unusual access to information about his relationship with Kim.
"It is so easy to behave as president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people outside into this crowded arena, we should have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said and showed the crowd in front of him.
Floods of tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
In the situation following the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs learned that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok were expelled from their homes, there was no national disaster, which is a prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they do not require international assistance, so it is a bit demanding," says Mrs. Sumbun.
The Save the Children organization is giving together a team that travels to Pal, but it is not yet clear if foreign personnel can work here.
Speaking agencies for national disasters, Mr. Sutupo said that the Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Paul to see if it would be possible for international organisations to help.
Since earthquakes occur very often in Indonesia, the country in wrath of the Mother of Nature is still unresolved.
In Aceh there were tsunami attacks, but on other parts of the coast it is not at all common.
The loss of human life may also have contributed to the apparent lack of orphans in Paul’s warning against tsunamis, even though warning was given.
Even at the best time, traveling between many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
The unarmed ship that sailed to Lombok and helped the earthquake victim is now moving to Paul, but it will take at least three days before it gets to the place of the new Kalamite.
The improvement of poor Indonesian infrastructure was the main point of the election campaign of President Joko Widodoa and the president lost a lot of money on roads and railways.
Next year he will try again for election, but his government is narrowing the funding gap.
President Joko also faces pressure from persistent sectarian tension in Indonesia, when members of the Muslim majority accept a more conservative form of faith.
Street fights between Christians and Muslims, where gangs use cats, bears and arrows and other primitive weapons, have already claimed lives for more than thousands of people and tens of thousands of people have left their homes.
See: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool shot the balancing branch against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored in the London Stamford Bridge on Saturday in 89 minutes and thus saved Liverpool from losing Chelsea at the Premier League.
Sturridge got a belt from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 meters before Chelsea gate when his team was losing 1-0.
He moved his ball to the left and shot it to a remote point.
The arrow flew high and directed to the right upper corner of the gate.
The sword finally skipped the jumping Kep Arrizabalag and ended up on the net.
"I was just trying to get to the right place to get a ball, and players like Shaq always play the most ahead, so I wanted to get as much time as possible," Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com server.
"I saw Kante coming closer to me, so I didn't think much about it and shot at one touch."
Chelsea in the middle of time led 1-0 against the head of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
Attacker Blues sent a belt back to Matthew Kovacic, then turned around in the middle of the playing field and sprinted halfway across Liverpool.
The gold ball has been playing fast.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard's beautiful street to the volcano.
He ran away from the defense and the left led to the remote tip of Alison Becker from Liverpool.
In the middle of 15 hours, Liverpool in the League of Masters at the San Paolo Stadium in Italy, runs with the local team.
Chelsea will play Thursday at 15 hours in London with Videoton in the European League UEFA.
The number of victims of tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832
As the Indonesian disaster agency reported on Sunday morning, the number of earthquake victims and tsunamis dropped to 832.
The earthquake of 7,5 struck a degree on Friday, caused waves of up to 6 meters high, and trapped many people in the troublesome buildings, said at the press conference of Sutopo Purvo Nugroo.
The city of Paul, which has more than 380 thousand inhabitants, was visited by anxiously built buildings.
Police arrested a 20-year-old suspect from stabbing a woman
The woman's body was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning, and the police immediately began investigating the murder.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7.55 hours on Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called people in the area who saw or heard anything to sign up.

I also ask everyone, especially the taxi drivers whose deck cameras could record something to contact us because they can have important information for our investigation,"
Police spokesman confirmed that a dead woman lived in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends came to the scene who think they know a woman to ask where she was found in the morning.
The police have announced that the investigation is under way and now inform the victims of the case.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one should go to the building or get out of it.

Socha Cromwell in Parliament recently became a target for the dispute over "rewriting history"
His expulsion would be worthy of punishment for his fanatical Puritan followers in the style of the Taliban destroying many of the English cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society has called Mr. Crick's proposal "crazyness" and "the effort to rewrite history."
The president of the Cromwell Society John Goldsmith says: “In the ongoing debate on the removal of the suspense, it was inevitable that the character of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Westminster Palace would become one of the objectives.
Cromwell didn't even make an iconoclass in English civil wars.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the deeds of his predecessor Thomas in the past century."
The beautiful creation of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the 19th century’s view and part of the character’s history, which many think is still worthy of being celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people regard Cromwell, although today less than at the end of the 19th century, as a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in his case, of course from the monarchy.
The preciseness of this interpretation is the subject of an indisputable historical debate.
Of course, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century created the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-identifiable position that represents one side of this transformation.
His achievements in the role of the Lord of the Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killer pigs smashed the Chinese farmer
According to local media, there was an attack and killing of a farmer by pigs in southeastern China.
As the Sunday newspaper South China Morning Post, a man with only the name 'Yuan', was found dead with a bloodthirsty bulge near the market in Liou-pchan-shuey in the province of Kuj-cho.
The pig breeder is preparing to apply the vaccine to pigs in spring 30 May 2005 in Si-ning in the province of Čching-chai.
Apparently on Wednesday, he arrived with a cousin from the next province of Jün-nan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found out that the door to the side window was open.
According to him, there was a big blood pressure in his jaw.
According to the information, during the forensic examination, it was confirmed that the 250 kilograms per farmer had broken down.
"The brother had his legs all bloody and broken," quoted the journal Guiyang Evening News as saying "Wu".
The security camera record shows how Yuan came to market Thursday at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousins.
The market manager told the Evening News that the press was closed so that no one could think of it when the police were collecting evidence at the scene.
Market representatives are allegedly dealing with the Yuan family on compensation for his death.
The attacks of pigs on humans are rare, but they have already occurred in the past.
In 2016 the pig attacked the woman and her husband at the farm in Massachusetts and the man was critically injured.
About ten years ago, 300kg of pigs brought the Belgian farmer to the tractor and lured him to the farmer's wife.
After the Oregon Farmer ate his pig in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba said the CBC News station that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can work as a "launcher".
"They're just playing.
They're... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to devote enough respect to them," he said.
The remains of the Rosa hurricane bring strong rain to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa, as predicted, weakens and moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, rain will be brought to northern Mexico and to the southwest of the United States.
At 5 o'clock in the morning, Rosa reached the wind speed of 137 km/h, representing Hurricane Category 1, and was 620 km southeast of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, over the Pacific Ocean, it forms a low pressure beam and moves east to the western coast of the United States. On Monday, when Rosa is approaching the peninsula of Baja California, she will have the shape of a tropical storm and start pushing tropical moisture north to the southwest of the United States.
In some parts of Mexico Rosa will bring up to 250 mm drops on Monday.
Tropical humidity, then, with approaching low pressure beams in the following days, triggers potential rains in the southwest of the United States.
The droplets 25 to 100 mm locally cause dangerous drifts, suti currents and possible dry land in the desert.
Strong tropical moisture causes the precipitation to be located between 50 and 75 mm per hour, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwest of the United States, especially above most Arizona, a 50 to 100 mm drop is expected.
In the event of rapid deterioration of conditions due to the dispersal of the nature of the tropical rain, there may be occasional flooding.
In view of the dangers of tropical precipitation, it would be very unwise to go on foot in the desert.
The strong rain may cause the canyons to become esophagus, and the storms will bring local shock winds and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure rail will bring strong local precipitation on some parts of the southern California coast.
A total impact of more than 13 mm may occur, which could cause lower currents of the satin and towing vehicles.
It will be the first drop in the rainy season in this region.
On Sunday evenings and Monday mornings they begin to approach Arizona and on Monday evenings and on Tuesdays the rain will spread.
On Tuesday, the strong rain will spread to four corners and will last until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense heat changes across the United States, because the Arctic begins to cool down, but in the tropical zone it will still be totally warm.
This sometimes leads to rapid heat changes in short distances.
The U.S. Wednesday is a great example of significant temperature differences.
Between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebrasce and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, the difference is almost 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, they will try to expand their summer heat.
In most areas in the middle and east of the United States, a warm start of October with temperatures of about 27 °C is expected from the south-east of the United States.
In New York City it could be 27°C on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows in the first half of October the probability of excess temperatures in the east of the United States.
Bretta Kavanaugh High School has been watching over 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched the six television channels for a quarterly candidacy of the candidate to the judge of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual assault, reportedly occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political plight continued, and the voters interrupted the regular programmes with reports of a sudden Friday return: an agreement that the Senator had reached in Arizona, Jeff Flake, that the FBI would conduct a one-day investigation of the charges.
Christine Ford told the Senate's judicial committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had sued her at a high school party and tried to dress her up.
Kavanaugh said in his excited statement that he was 100% sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people were watching the event, as reported by Nielsen.
The company calculated average monitoring at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stations.
The numbers for other stations that sent the statements, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen tends to have trouble starting people who look at their offices.
For comparison, it's a similar number of spectators who watch football matches in the play-off or the Oscar sharing.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the greatest monitoring of all stations, according to Nielsen's agency during the entire day's hearing on average 5.69 million spectators.
The second was the ABC station with 3.26 million spectators.
Nielsen points out that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest continued even after the end of the discussion.
Senator Flake was the main character of the Friday drama.
After the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught him on Friday morning, as protesters were calling on him when he was about to go to the hearing of the judicial commission.
CNN carried on a live record of how a few minutes he stood with his eyes closed and let himself be put on.
One woman said, "I'm standing right in front of you."
"Do you think the earth is telling the truth?"
He also said, "You have power, while many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement, and even before the door was closed, he added more to the committee's proceedings.
All cable and television networks were broadcast live later when the judicial commission was due to vote on the submission of the Kavanaugh nomination to the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if the prosecution against the candidate was investigating the FBI next week, which required a minority of Democrats.
Flakea partially convinced talks with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After the conversation with Coons and several other senators, Flake decided.
Flake's voice was important, because it was clear that without an investigation the Republicans would not have to approve the Kavanaugh vote.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into the charges brought against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "politicians" about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in the Sunday Times discussion, accused the criticism of his plan to leave the European Union that "politicians" about the future of Britain and undermine national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May comes to the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another discussion, which was close to the Prime Minister on the title side, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan when he said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to each other to choose their duties was "unreasonably absurd".
Shooting Waydea Simse: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of the LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect in the case of the shooting of Waydea Simse, a 20-year-old LSU player.
The police department in Baton Rouge said that Diteon Samson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on the basis of a second-degree murder charge.
The authorities published a video with a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to Sims police, he lost his glasses in the fight.
According to the WABF channel, which belongs to CBS, the police have secured the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
According to the police, Simpson admitted to having Waydea shot after the investigation.
According to the defendant, the bail was set at $350 000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a head and neck injury.
The department thanks police units for Louisiana refugees, criminal labs of state police, South University police and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local police for "swimming and striving for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-metre attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU,
In the last season, the average score was 5.6 points and 2.6 points.
The basketball coach LSU Will Wade said on Friday morning that Wayde's death was a "hit" and "shocked" team.
"This is what you're still afraid of," Wade said.
Sopca chrí ash on Mexico City
The ash that flows from the Popacatepetl soup has hit the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans not to get close to the soup after the volcanic activity increased and 183 emissions of gas and dust were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was watching a lot of scratches and scratches.
On social networks there were images of front glass cars covered with a thin layer of ashes in some quarters of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics recorded an increase in the activity of the soup, which is 72 kilometres (45 miles) southeast of the main city. The last earthquake devastated central Mexico in September 2017 and had the strength of 7.1 degrees.
Vulcan known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the independence vote, the police shot with Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesting the independence of the police and thousands of people engaged in competitive demonstrations on the occasion of the first year of the independence vote, which was distributed by Catalan.
The order police blocked a group of masked separatists who threw eggs and powder after them. On the streets, which are usually flooded tourists, they created a dark cloud of dust.
Later, they also broke out of the loops to which the police had to use shoes to calm down.
Groups supporting independence over several hours sang "We will not forget, we will not forgive" face-to-face the protesting steps of the Union, who called "Let Spain live".
According to the local press, fourteen people were easily injured during the protests.
The year after the 1 October referendum, which Madrid considers illegal, but separatist Catalans celebrates, remains the tension in the region which is still high in independence.
The majority of voters spoke for independence, but participation in the elections was low, because the resistance to cutoffs boycotted them.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police in violent camps throughout the region tried to put an end to voting in the polling stations.
Groups supporting independence remained on Friday night outside to prevent demonstrations to support the national police.
The demonstration was going on, but she had to choose another route.
Eighteen-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who joined a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped in the prospect of gaining independence for Catalan.
“We had one of the best moments last year.
My parents were glad they could vote, but now we're in a blind alley," he said.
Despite the importance of the close victory in the regional elections last year in December, the Catalan party supporting independence had to fight to keep things going this year. Many of their most famous leaders either went to exile themselves or waited in court for their participation in the referendum organisation and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Twenty-two-year-old Mounter Joan Puig recorded a protest in support of the police on his phone and said that the conflict had stirred politicians on both sides.
"The situation is still more tense," he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders, who have been waiting for the end of last year in prison for the trial, announced on Saturday that the next year will run for the European Parliament.
"The candidacy in European elections is the best way to judge the decline of democratic values and the repression that we have witnessed by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car hit home
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years of age, were arrested after repeated visits to Londonderry’s home.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gate and the house itself.
At one point, maybe someone shot the car out of the bush.
Mengo's hit secured Livingstone's victory 1-0 over Rangers
First goal of Dolly Mengy for Livingston secured victory
Livingston, who came from a lower division, shocked Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second defeat of 18 matches in the role of Ibrox's club manager.
The Trefa Dolly Mengy proved decisive when Gary Holt's team arrived at the hibernian in the second place.
Gerrard's team this season hasn't yet won the Premiership game in the league, and next week it's the first Hearts to lose eight points.
Soon, Rangers will be hosting Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston expanded a number of unbeatable games in the division to six matches, so the main coach Holt, who was shooting Kenny Miller last month, hasn't tried to defeat yet.
Livingston didn't take a chance against the indiscriminate guests.
Holt's team was supposed to lead a long time ago, because his privacy caused Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but failed before the door, then Alan Lithgow just passed the Craig Halket's head right in front of the white.
Home just watched the Rangers play before them, because they knew that guests could face standard situations.
And so came the key target.
Against the Rangers was built a free dome and Livingstone created a sculpture, Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly sent Mengu, who was running and scored the ball in the middle of the Pacific.
At this stage, Rangers dominated the holding of the ball, but the domestic defense for them was invincible, and most of the time, Liam Kelly had no job.
The same picture of the game was in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos made Kelly try.
Scott Pittman stopped his legs by Rangers Allan McGregora and Lithgow from another standard situation in Livingstone.
The centres that the players were constantly cleaning up in Livingstone’s outback were constantly flying, and there were also two penalty piles – after Halket’s attack on the deputy Glenn Middleton and the other hand.
"Fenome" from Livingstone – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
Phenomenal performance and results for Livingstone.
They were excellent without exception, and on their way up they still surpassed expectations.
Their style of games and manhood have hardly changed since the return to the summit, but great praise deserves Holt for how the team has been excavating since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, leading a great organized defense, while Menga kept up with Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall all the time.
Rangers have a lack of inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but these standards don't apply anymore.
Their finals were chabs – only once penetrated the home side – and for Rangers it should be a wake-up because they are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan reached a mixed reception in Cologne
When Turkish and German leaders met on Saturday (September 29th) at breakfast in Berlin, the sky was blue and everyone laughed.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They did not agree on a number of issues, including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Kolín, where he opened a huge new mix.
In this city there is the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police for security reasons prevented 25 thousand people from meeting in front of the compound, but there were many supporters in the area who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people were heard – many of them were Kurds – protesting Erdogan, who condemned his policy and the decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
The protests against them reflect the controversy of the visitor, whom some German Turks celebrated as a hero, and others declared as an autocrat.
Accident in Deptford: cyclist died on the street with a car
In London, a cyclist died after a car crash.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 local time near the Beswod Street intersection with the ruinous street Evelyn Street in Deptford in the south-east of the city.
The car driver stopped and soon the ambulance arrived, but the man was dead.
There was only a few months after another cyclist died about a mile and a half from the Saturday tragedy scene on Childers Street, when the driver was caught from the scene.
The Metropolitan Police reported that police officers are now trying to identify and inform his relatives.
The road is closed, buses drive through replacement routes and motorists are recommended to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: In trouble, six guards were injured
According to the prison office, six guards were injured at the men’s prison in an emergency.
The riots broke out in Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 local time and still persist.
To deal with the emergency, which involved eight prisoners in a single wing, specialized supervisors from the Tornado team were called.
The guards suffered a slight injury and were treated locally.
Speaking in prison, he said: “To handle the ongoing incident in Long Lartin prison, special training was given to prison workers.
Six staff members were treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend a long time behind the networks."
In Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous delinquents in the country.
In June, it was announced that the director of the prison ended his attack at the hospital.
And last October, the police were sent to prison for serious trouble, where the staff was attacked by bullet bullets.
Hurikán Rosa threatens with floods in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (the area where it is dry can thrive)
It is not common for Arizona to hit a tropical low pressure, but it will probably happen at the beginning of next week when the remaining energy of the Rosa hurricane exceeds the desert southwest and brings the risk of flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued a warning against the floods on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona for southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to be released on Tuesday directly through Phoenix and will bring rain on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix on Twitter stated that “only ten tropical cyclones have saved up to 320 miles [320 km] from Phoenix’s tropical storm or pressure lower since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane about 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Centre for Hurricanes predict cuts 50 to 100 mm, in the area of Mogollon Rome in Arizona up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the desert northwest, including the middle of the Skalist mountains and the Great Mountains, it is likely to fall 25 to 50 mm, with local beads up to 100 mm.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, the rain of Rosa may be a blessing because the area is dry.
Floods may be very serious, but they may even help because the Southwest of the United States has just hit dry.
Server Weather.com indicates that according to the U.S. Drought Monitor service, more than 40% of Arizona enjoys at least "extreme dry", which is the second highest category.
The Hurricane Rosa route will first lead to the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still about the force of hurricane with maximum wind speed 137 km/h, then Sunday morning will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move 19 km/h north.
Then the storm will meet with the colder waters of the Pacific, and then it will lose its power.
It is expected that Mexico will arrive Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, precipitation will be strong, which is a major risk of flooding.
“In the area from Baja California to the north-west Sonor, total cuts of 75 to 150 mm are expected, with up to 250 mm available,” says the server weather.com.
Rosa then travels as a tropical storm across Mexico north and Tuesday in the early hours of Arizona. Then she goes to Arizona and later in the late afternoon she enters the South Utah.
“The main risk of Rosy or her remains is expected to be very severe hits in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States,” the National Centre for Hurricane.
These rains are expected to cause fatally dangerous wave floods and rivers of Sutinum in the deserts and droughts of the ground in the mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four persons arrested for attempted murder
Three boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspecting a murder attempt after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4:00 local time.
He was transferred to the hospital and his condition is now "stable".
As police told Avon and Somerset. Young men between the ages of 17 and 20 were detained at night in the Radstock area.
Police are looking for witnesses who could have on the phone a record of what happened.
Trump says that Kavanaugh has "defeated vanity and rebellion" Democratic parties
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the unrelenting and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump declared that during the process, Kavanaugh had "defeated vanity and contempt" by the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh spoke in front of Congress on Thursday, where he resolutely and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's call that she was sexually assaulted a few decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also spoke on the charges against her.
On Saturday, the President said that on that day "American witnesses were witness to Kavanaugh's splendor and qualities and courage".
The representative of his supporters from West Virginia said that "the voice confirming Judge Kavanaugh is the confirmation of one of the greatest legal brains of our time, a lawyer who has an excellent public service account".
The President directly attacked the Kavanaugh nomination when talking about how important it is for Republicans to participate in the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't mind, but I'm still moving," he said.
"That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
Trump declared that the Democrats had decided on "responsibility and obstruction".
The Board of Directors of the Republican Party said the CNN station that the first key procedural vote on the Cavanaugh nomination on the ground of the Senate is expected not later than Friday.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia killed hundreds of people and the number of victims continues to increase
On Saturday, the authorities announced that after the Indonesian island of Sulawesi hit vast earthquakes and tsunamis, at least 384 people died of life, from which many of the huge waves that flooded the beaches.
On the beach in Palu on Friday, hundreds of people met at the festival. However, during the summer, the coasts hit up to six-foot waves that killed many and destroyed everything they had on their way.
The tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
"When the threat of tsunamis came to light yesterday, people continued in the activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, so they fell in waves behind the victim," said the Indonesian spokespersons' agency for the mitigation of BNPB Sutopo Purvo Nugro's riot in Jakarta.
"The waves of tsunamis didn't go alone, took with them cars, tents, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugro said and added that before the attack on the coast, the waves of tsunamis on the open sea spread 800 km/h.
He stated that some people before the wave fled to the trees and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Pal.
The flying photographs published by the Agency for Noise Reduction show many destroyed buildings and shops, broken and broken bridges and mixed with water.
The consequences were devastating to the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
In its statement, the Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) stated that energy released by five-fold power surges was approximately 200 times higher than the nuclear bomb force spent in World War II at Hiroshima.
The city lies at the end of long, narrow bays, which could have increased even more by waves.
Nugroho described the damage as “abundant” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been destroyed.
He mentioned that the bodies of some victims were found confined under the care of the fallen buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho informed that the number of victims and damage could be greater on the coast 300 km north of Pal, in the area called Dongala, which is near the epicenter of earthquake.
According to him, the communication was "exclusively protected without any information" from Dongal.
In his statement, the Red Cross stated that more than 300,000 people live in the area, and he added that his workers and volunteers were heading into the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get worse," the statement says.
On Saturday, the Agency met with considerable criticism because it did not inform Paul that it had hit the waves with tsunamis, even though the authorities indicated that the waves had arrived at a time when warnings had been issued.
In amateur recordings shared on social media, it is heard how a man on the upper floor of the building with a desperate scream warns people on the street from approaching tsunamis.
Within a few minutes of the coast, the water wall will strike, which refers to buildings and cars.
The Reuters agency was unable to verify the record immediately.
Earthquake and waves caused a major electrical accident that interrupted the communication around Paul, so the authorities could only co-ordinate rescue work difficultly.
According to the military authorities, cargo aircraft began to be sent from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated people still need food and other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened only to help transport and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was to visit the evacuation center in Pal on Saturday.
The number of victims of tsunamis in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision workers from Dongal arrived in the city of Paul, where the employees were hiding in shelters from the temples of the office building, they saw the images of the deaths on the way, says Mr. Doseb.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he adds.
It's too bad.
When relief teams began their sad disaster relief work, some complained that foreign workers with great experience were not supposed to come to Paul.
According to the Indonesian regulations, the funding, resources and personnel from abroad may begin at the site of the Kalamati until the national disaster zone has been declared.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the province level," says a speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross Aulia Arriani.
“As soon as the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster’, we can start international aid, but it is not yet.”
When the second night of the Friday earthquake and tsunamis, friends and relatives of those who are still unbelievers in Paul’s day were still hoping that their love would be the miracles that echo the grim stories of natural disasters.
They pulled out of the little boy's channel on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been imprisoned for two days under the cares of her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, a coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglidists in the Asian games that ended this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandaghi, were his students.
"As a person who has been paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Mr. Gendon cured how in the hours that followed after the paragliding community learned about the establishment of the Roa Roa Hotel, he sent a message through whatsapp competition from Pala, who participated in the beach festival.
His reports, however, ended with a gray mark instead of two blue bolts.
"I think this means that the messages have not been delivered," he says.
Thieves took $26,750 while filling the ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to the news of the police department in Newport, on Friday, the thief killed 26 750 USD employees of Brink while supplementing the ATM in Newport on the Levee.
As Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the car driver emptied the ATM into a fun complex and prepared to deposit another money into it.
When he did so, another man “run away from the staff of Brink” and stole a money-supply that was to be put into the ATM.
According to the press, several suspects were seen from the scene, but the police did not clarify the number of people involved in the incidents.
If you have any information about the identity of the suspects, please contact the police in Newport number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Raper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changes his name – on Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote: "A person is formally known as Kanye West."
Forty-year-old West has been using the name Ye for some time and a pseudonym as the name of his eighth album that came out in June.
The change comes before his show on Saturday Night Live, where he should introduce his new Yandhi album.
In the show, he replaces the singer Arian Grande, who canceled his participation for "other reasons", as the creator mentioned in the series.
The West has already said that the word for him has, in addition to the abbreviation of the existing professional name and religious significance.
"In my opinion, "yes" is the most used word in the Bible, where "you" means "you," the West was allowed to hear the beginning of this year when he spoke about his album with a loud Big Boy moderator.
"So it's you, it's us.
It has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to the only Yes – as just a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are,"
The name has changed to a number of other famous rappers.
Sean Combs was known in various periods as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced giving preference to the names Love (love) and Brother Love (brotherly love).
The former JAY-Z co-worker of the West also wrote with the associate and without him and the big and small letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised not to use the army against civilians
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the bloody attack on students, the newly elected Mexican president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, committed never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza promised that "he will never use the army to lure the Mexican people."
At a time when left student movement spread throughout Latin America, soldiers on October 2, 1968 started shooting people at a peaceful demonstration in the square and killed up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those studying and opening up other free public universities.
He declared that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education would lead young people to criminal gangs.
USA should double funding for artificial intelligence
According to the investor and expert on the artificial intelligence of Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and the USA should double the amount they charge for research in this area.
The commentary comes after various parts of the U.S. government have published an AI notice, although the U.S. as a whole has no formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China has introduced a plan that aims to be a single in innovation AI by 2030.
"Dualisation of the AI research budget would be a good start given that all other countries are far away from the USA and we are looking for further difficulties in AI," Lee says.
Lee said this week in a discussion for CNBC that double funding could double the chance that the next major discovery in the area of AI will be made in the USA.
Lee, who spent this month in the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt loading house of his book "Supervelmacy AI: China, Silicon Valley and the new world order", is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's most important AI companies, Face++.
At the University of Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s he worked on the AI system that won the best American player in the game Othello, and later he was the head of Microsoft's research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee assessed the previous U.S. government technology competition, such as the Robotic Challenge of Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when else would help identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants, according to Lee.
"Academical peaks don't take China, but corporations," says Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been using the best university experts in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
To improve efforts in the area of AI, according to Lee, the United States could also help change immigration policy.
"I believe that green cards should be offered automatically to doctors in the field of AI," he says.
The State Council of China issued the Plan for the Development of artificial intelligence of a new generation in July 2017.
Chinese National Funding of Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way as the National Scientific Council and other government organizations are giving money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, says Lee.
This year, the US Ministry of Defence established the Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from the industry and the academic environment, and announced to the White House the creation of the Committee of Choices for Artificial Intelligence.
A DARPA announced this month that it is investing $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to the NSF funding, it now invests more than USD 100 million per year in AI research.
However, the US legislation, which wanted to create the National Security Commission for artificial intelligence, has not been able to do anything for a number of months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, people from Macedonia voted in the referendum on whether the name of the country should be changed to the 'North Macedonian Republic', which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which blocks applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of the northern neighbour represents a claim in its territory and therefore vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
Both governments have concluded the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change weakens the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slovenian population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for the boycott raised doubts as to whether he would deliver at least 50 per cent of the volunteers needed to be valid.
The question in the referendum was: "Are you for membership in NATO and the EU with the adoption of an agreement with Greece?"
The beneficiaries of the change of name, including the President of Zoran Zaeva, claim that it is the price that is worth paying for Macedonia, one of the successor countries of the former Yugoslavia, to join the organisation such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come to vote today for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," says 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not mandatory, enough Members of Parliament said they would be guided by the result of the vote.
Changing the name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Committee stated that no problems had been reported within 13 hours.
However, the vote was only 16 per cent versus 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters finally gave their vote.
"I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old volunteer from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko, deliver their votes in the Macedonian referendum on the change of name, which would open the country's way to NATO and the European Union, in Strumlica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small podium and pulls the chairs out of the state of the people who are boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with a head-on, not a door for the service," Kavadarkov says.
“We are a poor country, but we have pride.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 %, so much investment is needed.
"I think the great majority will be for, because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
According to him, the result of "yes" would be "to confirm our future".
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, the referendum could participate between 30 and 43 percent of the people – which is less than the required participation.
Another survey organized by the Macedonian Telma TV station found that 57 per cent of respondents were going to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70% said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, it has to be 50 per cent plus one wanted.
The failure of the referendum would mean the first serious wound to the policy of the Western government since its appearance last May.
Look at this: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City came for the goal through the entire Brighton defense.
Sergio Aguero and Rahem Sterling arranged for Brighton's defense on Saturday, thus ensuring Manchester City won 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In the administration of Aguera, his goal in 65 minutes seemed ridiculously easy.
It all started with a recording that the Argentine attacker got in the middle of the field.
He sprinkled between three British defenders and got into an open space.
Aguera then wrapped up four green clothes.
On the outskirts of Brighton's slump, one of the defenders left, and a few others went ahead.
The next recording on the left found Sterling.
The English attacker attached a ball to Agueru's rudimentary area back, which was routed by Briggton Mathew Ryan's barrier to the right side of the network.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," the City Pep Guardiola reported to reporters.
“We thought he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
And so it was.
We were lucky to have a goal at the moment."
The initial advantage for Sky Blues in this game is Primer League, but Sterling has been set up.
This goal fell in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a ball deep in Brighton's territory.
On the left hand side, he sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane.
The dream was working the ball and then sent Sterling to the remote point.
The Sky Blues attacker turned the ball into a net just before he crashed out of the field.
The city will play on Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoppenheim in the League of Masters at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to lose the joy of Rockies
When the Nationals were expelled from the game-off fight, there were not many reasons to re-evaluate.
But forever competitive Scherzer hopes that Sunday he will stand on the spot of the broadcaster in the fight against Colorado Rockies – of course only when they have Rockies, who lead the NL West in one match over Los Angeles Dodgers, hoping for play-off.
Rockies secured their first title in the division on Friday night with at least a wild card winning 5-2 over the Nationals, but they still want to get their first title in the division.
“Even if we don’t play anything, we can start at least because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the second team will be playing with the greatest effort I’m going to experience this year.
Why don't I play it?"
Nationals have not yet reported who will start on Sunday, but it is supposed to turn down Scherzer for such a situation.
For Scherzer, it would be the 34th start.
During this season, Washington's regular controller has statistics 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 shifts.
Trump went out for a meeting in West Virginia
The President expressed his views directly on the situation around his candidate to the judge of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republic's participation in the mid-term election.
"In November everything we've done will be in place.
In one of the most important choices in our lives, there are five weeks left.
It's one of the big, big – I don't mind, but we're still on the move and we're fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible group of Democrats, you see it is happening right now.
And they're determined to take over too much with any necessary means, you see here vanity, resistance.
They don't care who gets hurt, who has to change to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we don't give them."
According to him, the Democrats decided to "resistance and obstruction".
"And you see it in the last four days," he added, saying that the Democrats are "disgrace and evil and resistance and slander."
He mentioned on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Judicial Commission, democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, leading to a loud cracking of obscurity.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
Uh, what?
No, um no, wait – it was really the wrong word of the body – the worst word of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a wide range of views.
It is intolerant to those who express their opinions
When Momenta activists in my local side voted for my memoir, there was no surprise.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour Members who said they were not welcome – because they sincerely said their opinion.
My colleagues from the parliament, Joan Ryan, were treated similarly because she had a resolute stand for anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby.
The importance of responsible economic policies, national security, Europe, paradoxically similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
The announcement of a Friday Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East stated that "we want the meetings to be accessible and productive."
Most of the eight years I've been a member of the local parliament on the Labour side, the GC meeting was exactly like that on Friday night.
Unfortunately, most of the meetings today do not last, and the promises of "more loving, more cautious" policy have long been forgotten if it ever started with it.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion is assessed as acceptable for the conduct of the Party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader. My colleagues, whom I had previously thought we had similar political views, suddenly expected me to turn 180° and stop the position I could not agree with – whether it is national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak to the public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – then there’s a breakdown of social media coverage, where they call for my resignation, denouncing Wednesday policy, and telling me that I shouldn’t be on the Labour Party side.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me are usually political.
I have respect for the professionality and determination of those colleagues who face each day the lure of sessistical or racist insults, but never will.
One of the aspects of this era of politics, of which I am most disappointed, is how violations become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should grow a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this varied rate of opinion and with every proposal to express distrust or change the rules of choice, the party becomes more limited.
In the last two years, I have been advised many times to stay back, not to look back, and then "I'll be fine."
But that's not why I went to politics.
Since I entered the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the poor government of Margaret Thatcher, who has let my class of general schools literally break down, I have been trying to fight for better public services for those who need them most – whether as a local council member or a government minister.
I never hid my policy in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been surprised by my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this proposal on Friday, I would just say that if the country is being sold to Brexit, which is damaging to households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
However, my main message is not intended Momento in Nottingham, but to my loved ones, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or political pragmatism will deter me from acting according to what I think is best for you all.
Chris Leslie is MP to Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undetected Ayr climbs to the top
Two late fives drew a bit of a final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderful fun game Tennnent's Premiership.
Now they're at the front of the table as the only failure.
Finally, it was an excellent defense and a better use of chance, which helped home to win, and Peter Murchie's visitor had the full right to be satisfied.
"In our fights we have been through great trials and we are still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he says.
Robyn Christie from Melrose says: "All honor to Ayra, they got the chance better than us."
Five Grant Andersons in 14 minutes, changed by Frazier Clim, sent Air ahead, but the yellow card for the Scottish representative Rory Hughes, who was released by the Warriors for the match, enabled Melrose to use computational exercises and Jason Baggot got an unchanged five.
Climo increased the lead of Ayr with the penalty and then scored exactly in half time and changed the solo attempt, so he adjusted to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a further delay due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who left the playground, and when he started playing again, Ayr again jumped up thanks to the five Stafford McDowalls who changed Climo.
Substituting Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the players in addition thanks to Bruce Colvin's unchanged five after a short strong pressure.
However, the house returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow for the attack of Clim without a ball, MacPherson of the penal order placed the ball behind the moving little Ayr.
Climo changed, almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's head and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth of five households.
Star Still Game starts a new career in hospitality
It appears that the star of the Still Game Ford Kieran series is moving into the hospitality sector. It was found that it was named the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 16-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvise in a popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he plays together with a long-standing comedy partner, Greg Hemphil.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the final series of the series, and it seems Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, Arigingmorn Limited is the Director of the company.
Herec refused to comment, but the source of the Scottish Sun newspaper indicated that Kiernan wants to join the "promoting business in restaurants" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": the interior Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors are watching the La Paz Marine Command, which is equipped with cables.
Above public buildings is a blue flag in the color of the ocean.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca for the Amazon are described by the password: “The sea is our right.
It's our duty to get it."
Throughout the interior of Bolivia, there is still a living memory of the coast, which the country lost for the benefit of Chile in the bloody war of the 19th century – as well as the desire to return to the Pacific.
These desires may be greater than a few decades, because Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice, which should fall on October 1 after five years of trial.
"Bolivia has energy, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course expects a positive outcome," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will follow the MSD decision on large screens throughout the country with the hope that the Hague tribunal will decide for the benefit of Bolivia's claim that, after many decades of interrupted talks, Chile must deal with Bolivia's sovereign access to the sea.
Charismatic native president Bolívia Evo Morales – who has a controversial fight to re-election next year – is also very interested in the Monday decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide for the benefit of Bolivia – and even if that happened, it would not change much.
This United Nations agency, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign a Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the MSD decision comes only six months after the last arguments were made shows that the case was "not complicated", says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the past four years, not only have Bolivian people supported it, but they may rather have offended it.
"The issues of access to the sea have been strengthened by the current Bolivian government," Zárate says.
It adds that Morales' attack rhetoric has weakened all the remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will once again act, but after this it will be extremely difficult to conduct a discussion.
Both countries have not changed their ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltz, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the decision of the court was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will be "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with each other's advantages," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would use the question of the sea as a political barrier.
"The disease never surrenders its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to find out that we need to deal with the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless the United States can trust it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation never arm their nuclear weapons as the first if he can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations Valne Assembly.
He called upon the United States to fulfil the promises given at the summit of the leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after the minister seems to be foreign to the USA Mike Pompeo is about to restart nuclear diplomacy, which has been tied to the dead point, more than three months for a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that they are "hopeful" that the continued sanctions and the US opposition to the declaration ending the Korean war could sometimes hit the North on their knees.
Washington is careful about agreeing with the declaration if Pchjongang doesn't make significant steps to disarmament first.
Kim and President of the United States Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is general skepticism that Pchjongang thinks he is serious about rejecting this arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure his safety.
Pompeo wants to visit Pchjongang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris reviews show that in your fashion shops the latest trend of huge head coverings soon arrives
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely block the sun, your search is at the end.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne discovered a number of huge headsets for their spring/year 2019 collection on a review that took all of them on the Paris Fashion Week.
Very non-practical hats this summer sailed Instagram, and these designers sent to the mill their exciting creations.
The exhibition piece from Valentina was overcrowded with a wide-angle reminder of feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Other extremely large supplements were decorated melons, magic hat and even pineapple – but they are not intended to warm their heads.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks – and just in time at Halloween.
Many of the petro-colored masks have their lips dirty and remind of Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One production recalled the incubator’s equipment with both snorkel and glasses, while the other looked like a grain of scattered ice.
And if you go on with a huge mode, you're lucky.
Modern experts predict that huge caps could even enter fashion stores.
Overgrowded hats come after La Bomba, a half-metre straw with a wide cremation worn by all from Rihanny to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cultural brand behind this very non-practice hat, which flooded the social media, sent another huge creation to the preview mill – a straw beach bag, which is almost as big as a model in swimsuits that carry it.
The dark orange rafi bag, removed by rafi's scarves and arranged white-skin gloves, was on the Paris Fashion Week with an exhibition piece of La Riviera spring/year 2019 from Jacquemuse.
Stylista Celebrite Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to appear in fashion shops for the next year – given that the designer had so much success with them, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for excessive supplements.”
John Edward: Language skills are necessary for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have a number of academic achievements, and they continue to have other excellent results in 2018. Individual and group achievements in sports, art, music and other community activities only encourage this.
These schools have more than 30,000 pupils throughout Scotland, the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) is represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and is trying to ensure the best level of service for their pupils and parents.
Independent schools prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement individually adapted school education plans, we note that modern languages are still popular and requested in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person in a language he understands, it goes straight to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes straight to his heart."
It is a significant observation that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely only on English.
The latest results of this year's trials show that languages are the first of the tables, with no higher level of success for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students learning a foreign language achieved the best of A.
Data gathered from 74 SCIS schools show that the highest score A reached 72 per cent of Mandarin students, 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills as children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages like objects that students choose are in study plans of independent schools as well as other subjects of STEM (studies, technology, technical fields and mathematics).
The study carried out by the British Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that, for reasons which employers report as problems with the inclusion of vacancies, 17 per cent of language skills are insufficient.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in the preparation of young people for their future career.
As more and more jobs require languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
If a person chooses any career, if he learns another language, he will have a real benefit in the future that he has such a lifelong ability.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person speaks more languages automatically for the benefit of competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouTube in 2013 by 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75 percent of them failed to speak foreign languages well enough to lead the conversation, and the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people, namely 15 %, was French.
Therefore, it is important for children today to invest in language learning.
If children learn more languages, especially languages that develop economies, they will have a greater chance of finding meaningful employment.
Every school in Scotland is different from what languages it teaches.
A number of schools focus on more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom in terms of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what the child is interested in, he will always have independent schools to choose from a number of languages with teachers who are in the field of expertise.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing the educational environment that children will prepare and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what lies ahead.
At this point, it cannot be argued that languages are essential in the global business environment for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should in fact be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
It needs to be done well.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will be performing in San Diego for the first time on Sunday in the Dress of Lakers
Fans who look forward to the first time LeBron James comes to Los Angeles Lakers are waiting for them soon.
Lakers Luke Walton's couch announced that James will play in Sunday's opening match in San Diego against Denver Nuggets.
But it's not clear how many minutes he plays.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton announced on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell on Twitter wrote that James probably plays only a limited number of minutes.
Last week after training, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers matches in the pre-season.
"In this phase of my career, I don't need pre-seasonal battles," he said.
trumpet performance in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump tonight at Wheeling in West Virginia begins a wave of campaigning.
It's the first of the five minutes planned for next week, including a stop in friendly places, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the suspension of the vote on the confirmation of his candidate to a vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to receive support for the upcoming elections in half of the mandate because the Republicans stand in November elections before the risk of losing Congress.
What time does Trump's show start tonight and how can you watch it online?
The trumpet meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia is scheduled at 19:00 east time, today Saturday 29 September 2018.
Trump's holder in West Virginia can watch online below using live YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about hearing a candidate to the highest court of Bretta Kavanaugh, which has been held this week and has been very tense about the allegations of improper sexual conduct. It is expected that the Senate's confirmation vote will be postponed for a week before the FBI's investigation takes place.
But the main objective of this wave of mints is to help the Republicans to speed up the November elections.
According to the Agency Reuters organizers of President Trump's campaign, these five meetings are intended to "give energy to volunteers and supporters so that Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority of representatives of the Senate and the Senate".
"The control over the Senate is so important to his agenda that the president will go campaigning in this moving season to as many states as possible," said Reuters spokesman for Trump's campaign, who did not want to be appointed.
According to West Virginia Metro News, supporters of "Ohia and Pennsylvania could be welcomed by the media from Pittsburgh at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling.
On Saturday it will be twice in the last month, which Trump will visit West Virginia, in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the Senate for West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the investigation.
"For Morriseye, it is not a good sign that the president must come to help him in his research," says Reuters Politologist at the University of Zapadovirgin, Simon Haeder.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team showed that stomach fights to keep hopes from Sunday alone
After three one-sided matches there may be two Saturdays just what Ryder Cup needed.
The hopeful quad is a completely invented sport concept, but players really believe it, and most of the time, in such competitions.
So, where's the quad going to collapse now?
"They know about six points and now they're four, so we're taking it so that the square is probably moving a little direction towards us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, leads four points and still remains twelve.
As Spieth says, Americans feel they have a bit of wind in their shells, and there are many things that can encourage them, such as the shape of Spiethe and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and everyone can boast of three points of four.
Speeth was dying when he moved from the shelter to the green and went as an example.
The famous screams still intensified in the continuation of his round when he managed the key pad to win the whole match when they were with Thomas in two jackets on two backs.
His route, which won them a 15-hour match, met a similar giant who tells you the American team isn't out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own battle," Spieth said.
That's all each of these players left.
18 bucks for leaving the trail.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of Ryder Cup.
Strange, but beautiful twos from Europe are four out of four and they can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood was the only two who didn't hit the pit on Saturday afternoon, but last Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and again on Friday morning."
This course and the way the energy flows towards the stormy audience confirms from it that these are the players for Sunday victory, and that in the West of the Sun over Le Golf National there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Best both at the same time on a different pit.
However, the words about European fame remain premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson worked with Serge Garcia, a hero of the wounded game with four cats when he was married to Alex Noren.
The cave and the two saws on the front nine buried Spain and Sweden into a ruin from which they had not escaped.
But no one will help you on Sunday.
Two games on two balls are so fascinating when you're closely following people's interactions in pairs, advice that they give, advice that they don't give, and how the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played better than a team, and by the last day, it has made a significant leap, but this two-legged game has also shown that the US team has a stomach for the fight that some, especially from the states, have doubted.
To the final day Ryder Cup leads Europe with score 10-6 points
Europe gets a healthy benefit until the last day of Ryder Cup after two two-ball Saturday games came out with a 10-6 jump over the United States.
The inspired Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who allegedly won almost twice over the fighting Tiger Woods, decided to do four races in Le Golf National.
The European party with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to hold the trophy that they lost in Hazeltine, dominated in the early games on two American side balls that failed in the 3-1 series.
The U.S. showed more resistance in the four, won two matches, but could not reach the deficit.
Page Jim Furyk needs eight points from Sunday's 12 matches to leave the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novelty to win four points behind it, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Mollwood" after the sensational weekend, are just the second pair to win four points from their four initial matches in the history of Ryder Cup.
After the defeat of the players Woods and Patrick Reed in the game on two balls and then they beat the tired Woods and the American novel Bryson Dechambeau even more important 5&4.
Woods, who went through two matches on Saturday, showed occasional brilliance lightnings, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in a two-ball game and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who started after a two-ball game in the morning, returned to Henry Stenson's partner in the game two times to the 2+1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepky - one and three in the world ladder.
Europe, however, did not have it on this pleasant fresh day south-west of Paris saved on the whole line.
Three-way top winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas raced two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a tough 2&1 victory over Spain Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the game on two balls and returned to defeat two Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the game of two, although the first two jackets lost.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup is the team returning from a four-point deficit to a double, although as a defending party of Furyk only needs a restriction to get a trophy.
After the second day was the best in two days, it seems that there's a Sunday attack behind them.
North Korea says "in no case" is not armed unilaterally and without confidence
Foreign Minister North Korea said on Saturday that the continued United Nations sanctions had deepened their confidence in the United States, and under such circumstances the country will never surrender its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at his annual Valuable Meeting that North Korea had adopted last year "a major measure of good will", such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing sites and promising that nuclear weapons and nuclear technology would not spread.
"But we do not see the corresponding reactions from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is not even possible to arm itself unilaterally."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to the "gressive" approach to denouncing, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for every step, its declaration appeared to be significant in that it did not refuse unilateral denouncing just because Pchjongang had already passed in the past.
Ri mentioned a joint statement issued by Kim Chong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim undertook to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump pledged the guarantees of North Korea's security.
North Korea is trying to formalize the war conflict from 1950 to 53, but the United States has said that Pchjongang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted the challenge of releasing severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The US insists on “the first denuclearization” and increases the pressure on sanctions to win its objectives, and even object to “the declaration of the end of the war”, Ri said.
“I think that sanctions can bring us to our knees, are people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions are exacerbating our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader emphasized in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings of Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If this issue of denuclearization were by the side of South Korea and not the USA, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a pitiful situation."
However, Rio's performance was dramaticly different from that of last year when he told the UN's valid meeting that the North Korean missile targeting in the US is inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "a rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations Trump, which threatened the "total destruction" of North Korea, Kim praised for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that much work and sanctions must still be carried out until North Korea is fully denuclearized.
On Wednesday Trump said he had no time frame for this, he said: "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pchjongang for the measures taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council Thursday that: "The continuation of the Security Council sanctions must continue to be firmly and uninterrupted until we are aware of the complete, final, verified denuclearisation"
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to suppress the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missile programmes Pchjongang.
Pompeo and Ri met at the UN-wide meeting and Pompeo announced that next month he would visit Pchjongang to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last journey did not end well.
He left Pchjongang in July and declared that progress had been made, only to report to North Korea over a few hours that he had "gangster requirements".
North Korea committed itself this month to meeting with Moon to dismantle the missile area and also the nuclear complex if the United States adopts the appropriate measures.
He stated that Kim informed him that the "responsible measures", in which he hoped, were the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and aimed at normalising relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard with a participating course to teach them sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has made all its students sleep more, and it is in an effort to fight the growing culture of macho studies all night long when students sleep and are excited about caffeine.
The academics have found that students at the world's most demanding university are often unemployed when it comes to the basics of caring for themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and a female hospital who is believed to be the first species in the United States.
He was inspired to start a course after teaching about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“A girl came to me at the end and said, ‘Why are you telling me just now, in my last year?’
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first presented this year, explains to students basic information about how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performances and improve their overall mood.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said that the university decided to take a course after finding that the students were really not sleepy during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of student colleges where students click on bars with coffee, curtains, tennis and books on the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleep habits.
In the other part, participants are informed how long-term sleep depression can increase the risk of heart attack, death, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
However, we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes on health," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "study all night" still exists, adding that modern technology and constant pressure on students mean that the problem of lack of sleep also increases.
The provision of good quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of a student for combating stress, exhaustion and hardship, he said - even so that it does not escape recovery, because sleep deprivation turns the brain into a mode of hunger, so man is still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler propose a course that he graduated from one of his classes during his first year in Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to press the whole course.
He hopes that in the next step, he will ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before entering the competitive institution.
The professor recommended that the students consider setting an alarm for the time when to go to bed, as well as wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic displays and LED lighting, which can determine your circus rhythm, leading to problems of descent.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga drowned Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss when the Dolly Mengy hits Steven Gerrard with a 1-0 defeat in Livingstone.
The Ibrox site tried to record its first victory from February 4th to February 1st at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only caused the second defeat of Gerrard in 18 games as a manager to leave its post eight points from the leading leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before half-time and the Rangers composition seemed to be out of inspiration and determination to balance.
While Rangers are now falling to 6th place, Livingstone is climbing to the third and immediately behind the Hibernian team in the difference of one branch.
And it could happen to other Rangers' problems after the spell judge Calum Spence had been treated with head injury after he was probably hit by an object from the point of view.
Gerrard made eight changes on his side, which moved around Ayr to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who picked up the Hearts point last week and would be pleased to see how his well-trained masculinely enthralled his opponent at every step.
Rangers may have controlled the holding, but Livingstone did more with the ball on their side.
They were only supposed to score two minutes after Menga first left Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's market, but the hostage buried his big chance.
The far-off Keaghan Jacobse had then found Captain Craig Halket, but his defence partner Alan Lithgow could only be at the back post.
Rangers took control, but it seemed that in the last third, there would be more hope than faith.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have a quarter-hour penalty when he and Steven Lawles met, but Judge Steven Thomson threw the Colombian challenge out of the table.
Rangers managed only two targets in the first half, but the former farmer Ibrox Liam Kelly was surprised by the head of Lassany Coulibaly and the short shot of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in 34 minutes could be against the running of the game, no one can deny that they've earned it for the wood.
Rangers failed to deal with the deep Jacobs set again.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher sent a ball to Scott Robinson, who was in peace and took Meng for a easy finish.
Gerrard took action at the stop and exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had almost immediate results when the wing was stuck to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly was fighting off the line and the attack was blocked.
But Livingstone continued to attract visitors to the game exactly the kind they like when Lithgov and Halkett metal one long ball after the other.
In the final stages, Holt's party was able to deepen its momentum, but McGregor was well built to block Jacobs before Litgow broke out of the corner.
Deputy Rangers Glenn Middleton had another delayed claim for punishment when he was wrong with Jacobs, but Thomson turned back.
Germans: Found Geiger's readers
And now the page from our Sunday morning Allah: September 30, 1882, today is 136 years old, and still occurs... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as Geiger's reader.
Geiger Counter became a pop-up of culture at the time, as in a 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in the main role of the unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
A man who says: "What is the god of this world?"
Rogers: “It’s Geiger’s computer that is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these hearings on, you can really hear the effects of the atoms emitted by radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Well, now he's really in it!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach an immune system to "see" dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation into the laboratory
Then they can "see" protein, which is common to many cancers, and then re-injected
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
One woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise dangerous cells has had ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their metabolism in the laboratory, so they can "see" the normal protein in many cancers called HER2 and then be applied to the cell again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute for Cancer in Bethesda in Maryland said, "Our results indicate that we have developed a very promising vaccine."
HER2 “directs the growth of several types of cancer”, including breast cancers, ova, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach, when immune cells were taken from patients and “learned” was to focus on cancer cells, was already promoted in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West took part in the pro-trump preaching, in his magic hat, after his performance on SNL.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was released in a study on Saturday Night Live after a confusing performance, during which President Donald Trump praised the US and said he would run in 2020.
After singing the third song that night, called Ghost Town, in which he was wearing the hat of Make America Great Again, he started swimming on the Democrats and repeated his support of President Trump.
"I often talk to white people and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
If I were to get rid of racism, I wouldn't be in America long ago," he said.
SNL started a show parody with Matte Damon in the main role in which the Hollywood star was making fun of Bretta Kavanaugh's testimony before the senate court committee on the cry for rape of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recordings of West's theatrical talk were recorded on the social media by the comicist Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to make West laugh.
West was also complaining to the viewers that he had his head made a good meal even in the back.
“In the background, I was ridiculed.
They said, "Don't go with that hat."
It's a joke!
They also said that I was in the wrong place," said Washington Examiner, according to the news.
West continued, "Do you want to see the wrong place?" and added that he would "put on his superman suit, because that means you can't tell me what to do." Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments were only used by the crowd twice, and SNL members seemed humiliated, in despair, says Variety, and one person even said: "The whole studio was completely quiet."
Westa was invited as a late replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West fooled many present by singing song I Love dressed as a bottle of water Perrier.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the most important characters: JERKU, SEE SES ESTABLISHED DAVU.”
But the guest talk show Karen Hunter on Twitter wrote that the West was "just who it is, and it's absolutely amazing."
“But I DON’T WANT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his “artificial”) who I believe represents and sends to the world of ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Just like us," she added.

He's not the first artist to change his name and go in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Comrade rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Lion and, of course, lost the music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then an artist who was formerly known as Prince.

Game Thrones Star Kit Harington has gone into the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in his hand in violent medieval fantasy series HBO.
Herec, 31 years old, however, came out of the stereotype macho hero and said that such a role on the screen means that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to earn respect.
News The Sunday Times Culture Kit said he believed that "something is wrong" and wondered how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his star of the throne of Rose Leslie, also 31 admitted that he said that he was "very strong" to this problem.
"At this moment, I personally feel, quite strongly - what became so bad with the masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach teenagers about the problem we see here now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise in toxicities due to its very male performances.
He continued: “What is born again, and what is taught?
What are boys learning on television, on the streets, growing up feeling that every man needs to have such a page?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our time - how to change it?
Because young men must have changed something worse.
In the discussion he also admitted that he would not play in any prequel or sequel games of thrones after the finish of the series, because he already has enough "fights and horses".

In June 2018, a couple were taken to the land of Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China indicates 14% growth in new cases
China has reported 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official figures, more than 820,000 people have been affected by this virus.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The overwhelming majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, which meant a change to the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads across some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have been infected with HIV in this way has been reduced almost to zero, Chinese doctors have introduced at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 per year.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT is allegedly still widespread.
In view of the country's conservative values, the studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually become women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these situations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV treatment as part of its efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters argues that the staff would have avoided the data of the GOP senators, the terms "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory"
On Saturday, US MP Maxine Waters condemned the claim that a member of her staff had sent personal data from three Republican US senators to the legislator's web site.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the charge was supported by “ultra-precious” scientists and websites.
"Little, false and other serious lies," Waters said in his statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly included addresses of houses and phone numbers for American senators. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information appeared Thursday on the Internet and published an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate's discussion on the allegations of sexual abuse by the candidate of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh.
The lack of information occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address, which is the source of the contributions, is connected to the Waters office and has published information about members of the Waters staff, says Hill.
"This unsubstantiated claim is a completely false and absolute lie," Waters continued.
‘The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were threatened as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, was in no way responsible for the failure of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is a completely false and absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly served online criticism, including from the former press secretary of the White House of Ari Flescher.
"This rejection is angry," Flescher wrote.
"This means that he does not have the temper to be a member of Congress."
If someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he must not be angry.
It can't be sharp.
He must not question the motives of the plaintiff.
He must be calm and not interrupt."
It seemed that Fleischer compared the Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats with that of Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticised because he seemed to be too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who participated in the election against Waters, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"If it were true, it would be something," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters stated that her office had warned “the competent authorities and authorities acting in criminal proceedings against these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the believers are revealed," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their acts that are destructive and dangerous to all and all members of my staff."
Johnny English re-enters the review – worse spy parody Rowan Atkinson
It is already common to look for Brexit in every new film with a British trend, which also appears to be the case of Johnny English's recovery in a series of action parodys - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this bold satire be on the subject of how clearly we are a bad nation, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this clever, non-competent Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to repack things in a completely new way - that name is more than any other signal that a wide comical design is intended for the non-English speaking cinematographic audience.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre demands on smoothie glamour, has a bit of Inspector Clouseau, a tip from Mr. Bean and a big bit of the guy who sang the only tone in the Chariots of Fire at the Celebration of the Olympic Games in London 2012.
The character is also originally based on the traveler and the international secret man Atkinson once played in the already forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, who left chaos behind.
In this last edition of the JE there are one or two beautiful moments.
I loved Johnny Englishe as he approached the chopper in the middle of the fire and his rotor hats were short on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is exposed, but humor feels quite subdimensional and strangely superfluous, especially when "series" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible are now offering comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is more like being intended for children than adults, and for me the crazy trampoons of Johnny Englishe are as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent movie gags in Mr. Bean's person.
The current assumption is that the United Kingdom has serious problems.
Cyber hacker infiltrated the British super-secret web network of spies and discovered the identity of all British agents in the field, to scare the agent in the service - to a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for the Prime Minister, who is a pumped and busy character, who is already suffering from the complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson's favorite Theresa May character is playing the best, but there is nothing in the scenario.
Her rapporteurs inform her that once every active spy is at risk, she will have to return someone from her retirement to work.
This means that the Johnny English himself, who is now employed as director of some luxury device, but at the same time he teaches record lessons about how to be a secret agent: here are a few nice gagas, because English offers a Spanish Academy similar to the School of Rock.
English returned to Whitehall because of the emergency bribing and met with his former long-suffering partner, Bough, who was played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man who lives with the commander of the basement, an affected character with the talent of Vicki Pepperdine perhaps even a little floating.
So Batman and Robin are back in action in packing tasks for the secret services of Her Majesty, and they meet a beautiful woman named Opheli Bulletin, who played with Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister is dangerously subjected to the charismatic technological billionaire's magic, who claims he can solve British computer crimes: the famous Jason Volt, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their ossuary full of frescoed Patals: the masking as the Czechs burns the French restaurant; it creates chaos when they crash on the board of Volt's luxury yachts; and English launches a clean anarchy when they try to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volt's home with virtual reality.
All the essays are certainly prepared for this last sequence, but whether it's even kind and noisy, it has something in it from the children's TV.
It's a rather moderate matter.
And just like the other Johnny English films, I couldn't think of: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson the role that really corresponds to his talent?
Labourers deny that they would develop an English plan to work four days a week to get paid in five days
Jeremy Corby's Labour Party is going to consider a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and will be paid in five.
The party allegedly wants the heads of companies to hand over savings to employees from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
Employees would enjoy the weekend - but they would still receive the same reward.
The sources claim that this idea would be "turned" into the economic agenda of the party and is planning to attract the country to the benefit of the workers.
The four-week shift was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to use the changing economies.
A long - term worker for Sunday Times stated: “The evaluation of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a week's work week is a wish, which falls into the party's position to export the economy for the benefit of the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party has promised a four-week work week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is currently not approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
The Labour Party spoke: "The weekly work week is not our party's policy and the party does not consider it".
The shadow officer John McDonnell used a working conference last week to fulfill his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to return the energy from "anonymous directors" and "teachers" in utility companies.
The plans of the shadow office also mean that the current shareholders in the water companies do not have to return to their total share, because the Labour Government could carry out "flashes" on the basis of the proposed commission.
It also confirmed plans to put employees in company boards and create own funds that transfer 10 % of own funds of private enterprises to employees who are entitled to pay annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said in the series "60 minutes", whether the investigation of the FBI Kavanaugha could change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has left the last vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question of whether the finding of the office could move some Republican senators to seek their support.
In Sunday's "60 minutes" interview, the correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could find out anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy looked more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said that I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened when the charge came out, and he said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, clear."
However , the Graham decision is insurmountable .
"I have already made my decision on Brett Kavanauch and it would mean a truly explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett strongly rejected it," Graham added with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of those whom she called could verify that.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be the annual music event Global Citizen Festival, which offers a very impressive number of stars and an equally effective mission at the end of world poverty.
The Festival Global Citizen in the seventh year welcomes tens of thousands of people who will meet in Central Park to enjoy not only artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of action, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty project, an international group to support the end of poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to be able to obtain free admission to the event (if you were not willing to pay for the VIP entry), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, e-mail to the world leader, telephone or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen 12 years ago before he reached his goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert really by the way they convince them to demand action, or is it just another case called "clickivism" - people who feel that signing online petitiones or sending tweets will change something?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, he has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from his supporters, trying to achieve different goals.
It says that these actions have contributed to the world’s leaders’ announcement of commitments and measures of more than $37 billion, which by 2030 will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group announced 390 commitments and notifications arising from its activities, of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid or financed.
The Group estimates that the funds secured so far have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the key commitments are the Power of Nutrition project, a British partnership of investors and realists who committed to "helping children grow to their full potential", promising to provide Rwanda $35 million for assistance in ending sub-trafficking in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, as you are, we can only make a note of social injustice in the form of subjugation in history,” the ambassador of the Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman said a gift during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, following more than 5,000 actions called for by the U.K. to improve food for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which represents 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequent questions on your web site with the question, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and hard journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and the movement against apartheid, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae is one of the new-year-olds in New York, who will host Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
USA could use the Navy for "blocking", which would defend Russian energy exports - Minister of Interior
Washington could "if necessary" turn to the Navy to prevent the rise of Russian energy on markets including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, quoted Washington Examiner as saying.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria - particularly where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an incentive to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to channel energy just as much as in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," he said.
And according to the official declaration, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the option of using our Navy to ensure that maritime routes are open and, where necessary, blocked, to ensure that their energy is not on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants to the events scheduled by the Consumer Energy Alliance, which is a non-profit group that in the United States is referred to as "the voice of energy consumers".
He compared Washington's approach and conversation with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are practically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is to invest more in or replace fuel," he said, and at the same time refers to Russia as a "one-sided" player with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declaration comes because Trump's administration is on the mission to strengthen the export of its fuelled gas to Europe and replaced Russia, which is much cheaper for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step away from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which according to Trump made from Berlin as Moscow's "household".
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, worth $11 billion, which is intended to double the current pipe capacity of 110 billion metres of pipelines, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce resistance to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of some competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure development tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The U.S. has raised an issue from Germany, which once again confirmed its commitment to the project.
The largest German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), called on the United States to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state involves our energy supplies," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises to "be close" to the presidential candidacy in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the elections in the middle of the election period, "a close look" at the presidential candidacy.
During the meeting of the Council in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering the candidacy.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, including the top women's position," The Hill said.
"After the 6th of November, I will look closely at the presidential candidacy."
Warren also mentioned Donald Trump at the meeting and said that he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"I fear to the west of the bone of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was opened in his criticism of Trump and his appointment as Supreme Judge Bretta Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren on Twitter stated that: "Of course we need an FBI poll before the vote."
However, the poll published Thursday showed that most of Warren's fans do not think they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probably" wishes of Massachusetts indicated that the senator should not run, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for the candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent for the candidacy and 48 per cent against it.
The other highly established democratic name, which was discussed in connection with the potential candidate by 2020, is former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, says Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin at a meeting with Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year on the list in September in Iraq.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence
“What my own son is going through, what he is going through after his return, can be related to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are returning with,” said the audience at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they are returning a little different, returning to prison, returning and wondering if there is any respect for the things their fellow soldiers and flighters and every other member of the army are giving their country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, the involvement in the report on domestic violence and the holding of arms in alcohol, reported Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States, D.C. supports the call for a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge of a new US government measure, which attacks asylum-stricken victims of gang or domestic violence.
The representatives of the eighteen states and the period Friday in Washington issued a short report on Friday to support asylum seekers and question this measure, the NBC reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, which gave the American Civil Liberties Organization in August was not revealed against federal politics.
She said her partner "and his sons and violent gang members" abused her, but the US officials rejected her application for asylum on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum-seekers in the United States, as nations facing all kinds of problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States has failed to comply with the decision of the Immigration Board in 2014, which has enabled illegal immigrants who suffer from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Advocate General Karl Racine of the D.C. stated in his statement on Friday that the new measure "neglects a decade of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law requires all asylum applications to be decided on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle," said a short friend.
The lawyers further briefly argued that the policies that deny immigrants' entry harm the US economy and say it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "add the necessary work".
General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges in the area of immigration to prevent asylum-seekers from being treated as victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Assil is available for those who leave their country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a certain social group or political opinion," Sessions said in their statement of 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems - not even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Zoufal rescue attempts in Pal, where the number of victims has already risen twice, run in search of survivors with time
For the survivors, the situation was worse and worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who enjoyed her hot boy at the evacuation center in the empty town of Palu.
"Every minute the healing will bring other bodies.
Pure water is rare."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their ruined homes, picking themselves out of the underworld and trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 were protected.
Some of the injuries, including Two Harris, who suffered from a breakup of their paternity and shoulders, were resting at Palu's army hospital, where patients were treated outside due to continuing severe subsequent shocks.
His tears filled his eyes as he felt that a violent earthquake had swept away his hotel room on the fifth floor, which shared a room with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I think I've been pushed into the wall," said Haris for Associated Press and added that his family was in town for marriage.
"I heard my wife was calling for help, but then quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're all right."
U.S. Ambassador blames China for "skiking" propaganda ads
The week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the US newspaper, which focused on the mutual benefits of trade between the USA and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned a paid supplement to China Daily in the Register of Des Moines - the state of the largest sales news in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to blend into US congress elections in the United States on 6 November.
Trumpov's accusation that Beijing was trying to get involved in the U.S. elections indicated what American representatives said that the Reuters agency was a new phase of a escalating campaign by Washington to develop pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to report commercials to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in the escalating trade war, which occurs at the level of mutual imports.
Chinese legal sanctions at the beginning of the trade war were designed to infect exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican side, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a significant exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing injured US workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a statement in the Sunday Des Moines Register that China now doubles this harassment by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a valuable American tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid advertising to Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
“Despite that, in a newspaper station on the Beijing Street, you will find limited disagreeable votes and you will not see any real reflection of the inconsistent views that the Chinese might have on China’s worrying economic path, given that the media belongs to the Chinese Communist Party.”
He added that "one of the most important Chinese news refused to publish the offer" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans leave their loved ones in front of elections because of a debate with Kavanaugh, protect analysts
As many of the top republics defend the candidate to the Supreme Judge Bretta Kavanaugh, who faces several charges of sexual assault, analysts warned that during the upcoming elections in the middle of the period, they will know the response, especially from women.
The emotion surrounding this case has been extremely high and most Republicans on the record already say they want to continue voting.
These things cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of political sciences at Maxwell University School in Syracuse.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for the last time trying to investigate the FBI would be enough to calm the voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and spokesperson for the MoveOn progressive group, newspaper in D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters were scandalizing "November is approaching!" at a demonstration in the hall of the Senate, where Republicans who are concerned with the judicial commission decided to appoint Kavanaugha, even through the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic stated.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will market records," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"People say it was high already, that's the truth."
However, it could be higher, especially among the women's vulnerable voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years of age who do not like the president, but often do not go to the elections."
Even before Ford's public testimony, detailing her charge of sexual assault on the candidates of the highest court, the analysts suggested that if Republicans confirmed, they could follow the resistance.
"That was the case for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about voting in committee or about final voting, nor about whether Kavanaugh sits on the table, it is also about how the Republicans managed and treated it," said Guy Cecil, the U.S. Priority Director, a group that helps to elect Democrats, pointed to the reporting channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided in the view that they believe in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with some more sympathy for the second named.
A new survey by YouGo shows that 41 per cent of respondents were probably or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent indicated that they probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh probably or probably lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake's FBI, he currently investigates the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, introduced The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate judicial committee on oath last week that she was attacked by drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court showed her her genitals at the party during his study at Yale University in the 1980s.
Web Finder World Wide Web plans to start a new internet and prevent Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technological legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the open source platform of Berners-Lee called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and who have access to information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the purpose of the Inrupt project was "world power."
"We have to do it now," he said about this startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own "Personal Online Data Storage" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Disk Google, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and in all at the same time.
What is exceptional on the online data storage site is that it is entirely up to the user to determine who will have access to some kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The purpose of the Inrupt project is, according to the Director-General of John Bruce, to bring the resources, processes and relevant skills to help Solid platform to be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, security platforms purchased by IBM, some employees working on the project cooperated on the project and community of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team with Facebook and Google don't talk about making a complete change, where all their business models are turned up at night.
"We do not ask for their permission."
Berners-Lee, in his contribution to the media published on Saturday, wrote that the mission of the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem that will help to protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium in Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The Celebration of the Spiritual Who During World War I received Victorian Cross
Hundreds of years have passed since the only Anglican spiritual church won the victory during the first world war of Victoria’s cross as a warrior.
Lieutenant Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in an attack on Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, the shooter killed him, and he never realized that he had won the highest British military rating.
His two grandsons discovered a memorial stone on Saturday during the celebration in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his lawyers, Michael Vann, said it was "genially symbolic", that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the victory of his grandfather.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt Col Vann led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin with a very dense silence and a strong shooting of full works and towers."
Later, he reached the first line and with “the greatest courage” led the line forward before he himself threw himself into the fire field and knocked three separate units.
Lieutenant Vanna killed the German shooter on October 4, 1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said that his grandfather's actions were "something I would never have done, but at the same time something that is humiliating."
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, after the survey conducted by the Younger Group of Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, they placed the wedding ring.
Michael Vann said that "he felt a great honor to be able to share in the audience," and added that "the courage of the true hero is shown by the support he gives to many people."
The MMA fans stayed all night watching Bellator 206, instead of getting the Peppa pig
Imagine, you've been waiting all night for you to follow the intruder of Bellator 206, just to get rid of your main event.
The San José account contained 13 points, including six on the main card and live shipments took place in the United Kingdom all night on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a match, the viewers in the United Kingdom were amazed when the news turned into a series of peppa pigs.
Some stayed unresolved after they had been awake in the early hours of the battle.
One of the fans on Twitter described a change in sending children's show as "a certain form of bad joke."
“According to the government regulation, such content is not appropriate at 6 o’clock in the morning, and it is therefore necessary to send out children’s series,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president for marketing and communication to Bellator after being asked for this transfer.
"Peppa Prasadko", yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said they would work on the program so that the viewers in Britain would be involved in the future.
"I think when I think about sending, we can probably handle it," Cooker said.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we won't make it until Sunday of our time, Monday of theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, a lot of texts went back and forth and not all were exactly friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it could be the government.
I promise you it won't happen again.
We reduce it to five matches instead of six – as we usually do – and we tried all our power to keep the promises to the fans and did not succeed.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "minor" because of sexuality
Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman stated that he did not realize until he went to high school that "not everyone is like him."
On the first radio 4 Desert Island Disc, who introduced Lauren Laverne, said he spoke out loud about gay rights to give other "hope."
He also said that he was less interested in winning the Olympics because of the possibility of becoming a parent.
The regular moderator of the long-term Kirsty Young series had several months free of disease.
Daley, who appeared to be a part of Lavern's first programme, stated that he felt "less valuable" than anyone who grew up with him because "it was not socially unacceptable for you to like boys and girls."
He said: "So far these feelings of inferiority and differentness have been real things that have given me strength and power to succeed."
He wanted to prove he was "Someone," said not to disappoint anyone who might have found out what it was like with his sexuality.
The dual holder of the bronze Olympic medal became a fighter for the right to move LGBT with a high profile and took advantage of his presence in the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he called because he felt lucky that he could live openly without consequences and wanted to add "hope".
This three-dimensional world champion stated that he was in love with the man – American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “the unprepared stop.”
Daley, the Oskar holder, who was 20 years older, took it last year, but said that the age difference was never a problem.
“When you were so young, he was at his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died three years later on cancer,” he said, “it was not easy to find someone at the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
In June, the two adopted Robert Ray Black-Daley's son, and Daley said that he "has changed the whole angle of view".
"If you asked me last year, it would all be "I want to get a gold medal," he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after his brain cancer was diagnosed.
Daley said his father was not going to die, and the last thing he asked was if they already had tickets to the London Olympics in 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him – you won't be in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and until he stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The year Daley attended the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
“I knew I had dreamed of it all my life – jumping in front of the sights of our home in the Olympic Games, I don’t know a better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired the selection of his first composition – Proud from Heather Small – which reasoned with him at the beginning of the Olympics and still called for a hen of skin.
Desert Island Disks is broadcast at BBC Radio 4 station on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was out of shape, ended up on the bench on Saturday at Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson would get a record on Sunday when he played 47, the Ryder Cup game, but he would have to take out a form to prevent it from being an unfortunate lover.
Mickelson, who played the event every two years on a double record, sent Captain Jim Furyk to the Saturdays and foursomes on the bench.
Instead of being in the center of action as often as it was in the United States, the five-year-old winner spent his day Wednesday between the cheerleaders and the work on the game in a row that he hoped would correct what he had suffered.
This 48-year-old player was never the directest of drivers, and it was not at the top of his career, so it is not the ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National playground, where the long-term member field routinely penalizes the wrong shots.
And if the golf course is not quite worrying about itself, Mikkelson is facing the British Open Francesco Molinari, which won all four matches this week with Tommy Fleetwood's new team.
If the Americans, who had four fewer points, had started 12 independent matches, had avoided a quick performance, Mickelson's match could have turned out to be a very basic one.
Fury expressed confidence in his husband and nothing else.
"Just grasping the role he had today, he hit me behind his back, put his hand around my shoulder and said he'd be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“They believe so much.
He's a member of the Sino Slam, and in the past and this week he's been so successful for these teams.
I guess I didn't think he was playing two cats.
I imagined more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Falda's record in most of the Ryder Cup West on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a career in Ryder Cup, which never reached the height of his individual record.
Mickelson won 18 wins, 20 prohers and seven remises, even though Fury says his presence to the team led to some unbearable results.
"He's fun, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make fun of people and he's a great partner in the team room," he explained.
“I think younger players also enjoyed the fun of walking after him this week, which was fun to watch.
He's giving it a lot more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from experience that a great lead towards singles from the last days in Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
Dane started a match in 1997 in Valderram, where a company led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point takeover over the Americans, but to the goal line they got a very close victory 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You still have to remember that we had a big jump in Valderram, as well as in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but only closely,” said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching when in 2018 they won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to lead Le Golf National 10-6.
So the stories and every member of this team showed me that it's not behind us.
Tomorrow you'll be completely bored.
Go in there and do all the right things.
It's not for you until all those points are on the table.
We've got a goal, and that's what we're trying to get a trophy here, and we're focusing on it.
I said I would focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to do on the other side – the best players in the world."
Bjorn, delighted with the way his players led on the complex golf course, added: “I would never have done it myself.
There's another animal waiting for us tomorrow.
Individual performances are being prepared tomorrow, and it's very difficult.
It's great to be out with a partner when it's good, but when you're going to be alone there, your golf player's capacity is fully checked.
This is the message you have to deliver to players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will take care of his players playing better as individuals than partners. Exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three points from four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these great returns when he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn to end up as a defeated when Europe reached "The Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," answered the question as Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, encouraged his players to move to the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to start quickly as in Brooklyn, as in Medina.
When this pace goes one way, it puts a lot of pressure on the mid-wars.
According to this, we set up the assembly and made sure that the boys felt like you know, as if we were going to be magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the attack and to face Rory McIlroy in the final match with the players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
“I went with the group of boys in this series because I think it covers the whole way,” Bjorn said about his selection of singles.
German new warship still suspended
The latest German maritime frigate was recognized in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but will not be available for at least one year because of faulty systems and snowy coasts, local media report.
The introduction of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ ship, a completely new train of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit, quoted by the speaker army.
The vessel was to become part of the Navy in 2014, but the dire problems with the delivery of this ambitious project have been ignored.
As a replacement for the old-fashioned Frigates of the Bremen class, four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will serve, which was ordered by the Navy in 2007.
It is clear that they will be equipped with an efficient work, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-fertilistic ballistics and certain hidden technologies, such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Another significant feature is the long maintenance period – the latest frigates should be possible for up to two years outside the home port.
However, constant delays mean that the ship’s peaks – which were supposed to allow Germany to send forces into the sea – will become obsolete by the time of entry into operation, notes Die Zeit.
Neblaze announced the F125 Frigate last year, when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss ship in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the manufacturer after the shipment.
It was only a little known about the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted a number of key "software errors and metal elements puzzles" which would make warships useless when fighting.
The design of the software was particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship will operate a crew of 120 sailors – half of the workers needed on Bremen class frigates.
It has also shown that the ship has a considerable overweight, which reduces its performance and limits its ability to add future innovation.
It is believed that 7 000 tons of Rheinland-Pfal ship will be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the metal elements, the cost of the whole project is also a problem – including crew training.
It is said that from the original EUR 2.2 billion, the price has risen to EUR 3.1 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates were particularly significant in the light of recent warnings that German maritime power is declining.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the leader of the German parliament's defence committee, confirmed that the Navy really "comes with the ships capable of landing."
This representative pointed out that the problems had been overloaded because the old ships had been removed from operation, but no replacements had been provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class fracturing is capable of being part of the marine equipment.
Organization National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new research is being carried out on the site of bats at the Scottish High School, focusing on how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
There is hope that the discovery of research will shed new light on the behavior of single-wing hunters and help to manage future activities to maintain this type.
The study carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will be followed by bats of stars, the smallest and the most distant long and watery in the botanical garden of Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special records will be placed in key areas in this non-capable site, which will monitor the activities of non-captures throughout the entire annual period.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings will detect the frequency of the call of bats and what individual species are doing.
Subsequently, a map of the habitat and the message will be published, which will create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, the NTS Nature Conservation Adviser, hopes that the results show what habitat areas are most important for bats and how individual species use them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of a shell, and the best procedure for maintaining forested areas for bats and other related species.
Indiscriminate populations in Scotland and the entire United Kingdom are dying to a large extent in the last century.
They are threatened as a result of construction and territorial development affecting the colony and the natural environment.
The risk may also be wind turbines and lighting, as well as a trap on flies and chemical treatment of building materials and cat attacks.
The bats are not really blind.
Because they hunt at night, however, they are more useful when hunting their ears than their eyes.
They're using an intelligent echo-location technique to get out of the cages and obstacles in the flight.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
He has trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, colony controls and sometimes rescue work.
This organization has even set up the first and only reserved non-refundable reservation in the residence of Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of non-refundables in Scotland.
The manager of David Thompson's residence says it's an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Thrave we have a great area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and the best habitat.
But there is still too much we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need for survival."
It highlights the importance of control of bats prior to the start of maintenance work in the properties, as it is possible that an unknown destruction of one mother nest may kill up to 400 females and young people, which can destroy the entire local population.
The bats are protected and are unlawful to kill them, to burden, to destroy or destroy their colony.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to add their hand to the work and help.
She said: "We do not know how to deal with their people, but we have to learn a great deal about them."
Ronaldo rejects the charges of rape and his lawyers are about to complain about the German newspaper.
Cristiano Ronaldo called charges of rape for "false reports" and stated that people "want to see" using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German journal Der Spiegel, who informed of these charges.
This Portuguese and attacker for Juventus was accused of rape by U.S. Kathryn Mayorgy in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently he paid her $375 000 to inform Der Spiegel on Friday about the case.
A few hours after the publication of the indictment information, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers and marked the information as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the five-person evaluator of the Golden Ball in the camera.
“They want to live on my behalf.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they call my name, but it's part of their work.
I'm happy and I'm fine," said the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are going to complain about Der Spiegel's unsubstantiated charges, which they labeled as "an unacceptable notification of suspicion in the private sector".
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player would claim compensation for “moral damage at the level of the corresponding seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations lately.”
The event was supposed to take place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel apartment and at the casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the game, where she was reportedly raped by a court case in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo stumbled after the alleged incident and told her that he had failed at "99 percent" and at "one percent".
The papers claim that Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also declares that she went to the police and left to arrange photos of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed with the extrajudicial arrangement, because "she was afraid of kidnapping" and was afraid of "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman claims that she is now trying to restore proceedings because she is still traumatized by a reported incident.
Ronalda, at the time of the charge of the attack, bought a famous Italian club Juve from the Royal Madrid Club from Manchester United and this summer for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will always regret the loss of car manufacturers
The UK "will always be sorry" if after Brexit, the world leader in the production of cars, the secretary for Greg Clark has been appointed.
He added that it is "anxious" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at Burnston, near Derby.
"The deal is necessary," said Clark.
The Japanese car stated that the effect of late-limits if the Brexit Agreement is not concluded can be a job.
In the race in Burnston, where the cars are produced by Auris and Avensis brand Toyota, almost 150 000 cars were manufactured last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would record the production stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnston.
Other cars, including cars Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in the United Kingdom, spread fear of leaving the EU without agreement as regards the functioning of cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its competition for the production of Mini cars in Oxford just one month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers label as a risk to the supply chain in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is in operation on the basis of the supply of "right in time", with parts from suppliers in the United Kingdom and the EU being supplied for cars produced on order within 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom left the EU on 29 March without an agreement, it could be disrupted at the border, which, according to the sector, could lead to delays in the lack of spare parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to have more than one day in the Derbyshire competition in stock, the company introduced, and this would lead to the suspension of production.
Mr Clark pointed out that Theresy May's plans for the recovery of future relations with the EU are "accalibrated precisely to avoid these border controls."
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best deal that allows, as I say, not only the current success, but also the capture of this opportunity," said BBC Radio 4's Today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other producers is that we must be absolutely able to continue in what is very successful now the supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long the production will be stopped, but in the long run it warns that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the race and, finally, would also be for job creation.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at the Burnston competition for 24 years and is chairman of the competition committee, said that the members of the committee’s organization are still more concerned: “I have the experience that once these places disappear, they will never return.
The Speaker's Government declared: "We have established a precise and reliable plan of our future relations with the EU."
The trumpet meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Advocate General Rod Rosenstein could be "at another week away", because he continues to fight for the post of Supreme Judge with Brett Kavanaugh, told the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein is working on a special board of Robert Mueller, which examines the Russian elections, the links between Trump's sidekeepers and Russia and the possible opposition by the President.
If Trump leaves the representative general power and thus threatens Mueller's independence, Washington's bells have been on the grid for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times stated that Rosenstein was discussing the recording of the camera to record the conversation with Trump and the possibility of the president's meeting through Appendix 25.
Rosenstein's message was rejected.
Last Monday, however, he arrived at the White House surrounded by reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, which was then in the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump stated that Rosenstein would not "be better" but then the meeting was delayed so that she could not be heard by the Senate's judicial committee, where they gave testimony to Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday Trump ordered an FBI weekly investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh, and the Senate's full vote was delayed.
Trump's press speaker, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday's reports on the Fox channel.
She answered the question at the meeting with Rosenstein: “The date has not yet been set, it may be this week, it may be necessary to move for another week in view of all that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'll always tell the current information to the media."
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference with the White House since 10 September.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders pointed out that too few press conferences had been subjected to a "divance" of television reporters, even though she said, "I do not agree with the fact that it will come out."
Then she proposed that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press be increased.
"The President arranges more meetings with questions and answers than any president before him," she added, without giving evidence. "We were looking at these numbers."
The conference will continue to be held, Sanders stated, but “if representatives of the press had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would certainly be better than talking to me.
Let's try it and you've seen that we've been doing this in the last few weeks, and that we're going to have a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly receives questions when leaving the White House or with open meetings or press conferences with visitors.
Single press conferences are rare.
This week, the president in New York probably showed why with his relaxed and sometimes bizarre view of the assembled reporters.
Ministry of Health writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland to avoid fear of Brexit
The Ministry of Health has written to EU employees working in Scotland's NHS to express their gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman's MSP sent a letter not even six months before the departure of the UK from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to raising the costs of applications for the status of EU citizens working in transferred public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “Over the years, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU continue to lag, and they focus on the expected decisions this autumn.
However, the British government is also taking steps in preparation for a possible withdrawal scenario without agreement.
I know it must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to assure you again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of nationality.
EU-wide colleagues also bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are beneficial to patients and communities that we provide services.
Scotland is absolutely your home and our desire to stay here is to stay."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
The kidnapped Tigers from Tennessee State, Christian Abercrombie, took the emergency surgery after he suffered a head injury in Saturday’s 31-27 defeat by the rival Vanderbilt Commodores, told Mike Organ of Tennessee.
The chief coach of Tennessee Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before midnight.
"He came to the side row and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and health professionals put Abercrombie on the side line of oxygen and then placed it on the plate and prepared for further evaluations.
A Tennessee State official told Chrisz Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had committed surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no information on the type/range of the injury” is available so far and that the State of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second in the red shirt, graduates the first season for Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
Before the end of the game on Saturday, he had five total moves, which means a total of 18 moves in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher real estate tax when purchasing properties in the United Kingdom
A foreign buyer will be charged a higher real estate tax when he buys a real estate in the United Kingdom, and money will also be used to help homeless people under the new Tory plans
This act will neutralize the success of Corby's knowledge aimed at attracting young voters
Increased duty on property tax will be paid for persons who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
An increase of £120 million per year — to help homeless people
Buyers from abroad will pay higher rent tax when they buy a property in Britain, and money will also be used to help people without a home, Today Theresa May.
This act will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby's success in attracting young people with the obligation to provide affordable accommodation and focus on people with high incomes.
The increase in real estate tax will concern individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the money will also strengthen the government's efforts to fight sleepless sleep over their heads.
The premium, which is an addition to the current obligation to pay the rent tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago in other houses and the purchase for rent, may reach up to three per cent.
It is assumed that up to £120 million per year will be raised in a government deposit.
Estimates say that newly built properties in London buy 13 percent of citizens who are not residents of the United Kingdom, making it easier for those who buy the first time to get on the ladder at home.
Many of the rich areas of the country, especially in the main city, have become “the cities of spirits” just because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new principles appeared only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called after a tax reduction from the purchase of properties to help more young people to their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by taking up the land, but not using it, and insisting on Mrs. Mayo to draw quotas from affordable homes to correct the "nearness of houses" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of housing reform proposals, including the management of rentals and the termination of "unsatisfied" displacement.
It also wants to increase the power of committees to build new homes.
Ms. Mayová stated: “Last year, I said that I wanted to devote my efforts as prime minister to the restoration of the British dream – to make every new generation have a better life.
And that means repairing our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create life here.
However, it cannot be right to make it easy for subjects who do not live in Britain and for foreign companies to buy homes as well as hard-working residents of the United Kingdom.
For many people the dream of their own home is too far away and the flood of sleep without a roof over their heads is too real."
Jack Ross: "My highest ambition is to drive Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross points out that his "highest ambition" is to become, at some stage, Scotland's manager.
42-year-old Scott is pleased with the challenge of restoring the North-East Club, which currently holds the third position in the First League, just three degrees below the top.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after bringing St Mirren back the Scottish Premiership league in last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got value B and that was it," Ross said on the BBC Scotland's Sportsound channel.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and that's always something that's gonna pull me back.
But such an opportunity would come only if I were successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors were: Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Chief Alloa Athletic says he didn't feel any anxiety about the consequences of such names introduced in such a big club when he previously rejected the prejudices from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
“Achieving success at that time would be a question of whether I can get this club back to Prime Minister League.
The structure and equipment in this club undoubtedly belong to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get him back there, but I guess I'd be successful unless I could get the club back there."
Ross has been a career in management for only three years, previously acting as a helper chief in Dumarton and spent 15 months as a coach of Hearts.
Then he helped Allo's club to get back from retreat to the third group and transformed St Mirren from the initial defeat to the winner of the title of the champions right away in the next season.
And Ross says he has a much better feeling now than ever in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academics.
"They were probably real crucifixes," recalls the time when Alloa was taken.
“I really believed that leadership was right for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I was good, I made good by doing it and using the right heights.
But the game can be challenging.
There's a lot of things you have to go through a week.
I'm still going through them in terms of stress and pressure, but I just have a good feeling in management.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I'm doing it, I feel like I've been feeling the most in my adult life in my skin."

Research found that a great time to paint is Saturday at 17:30
The summer rain increased the revenue of British households facing difficulties, but increased the pressure on the chain of restaurants.
The figures show that households and bar groups recorded a 2.7 per cent increase in sales in July – but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from CGA’s consulting company, who produced final reports, stated: “The stable sunlight and longer than the expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a pattern similar to that of previous June, when visitors to the host increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were even more affected.
The decrease in restaurant markets by 1.8 per cent in June has worsened in July.
Gods and bar drinking have so far led the most powerful way in which restaurants have deteriorated.
The Lords whose main markets are from food also suffered the sun, although not as dramatic as the restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between controlled values and bars the sale of drinks rose by 6.6 per cent per month, while the sale of food by three per cent decreased."
Paul Newman of the company of leisure activities and hospitality said: “These results are a continuation of the trend that has been taking place since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sports events are the biggest factors when it comes to sales outside the domestic market.
It is no surprise that restaurant chains continue to fight, although the annual decrease in sales by 4.8 percent will be particularly painful in the light of current pressures on costs.
The long hot summer can't be a worse time for food-supply operators and time will tell if the smaller temperatures that we experienced in August will bring so much needed relief."

Every fifth child has a secret account on social networks that hide in front of parents
Every fifth child, aged only 11 years, has a secret account in social networks that hides from parents and educators, shows research
Research among 20,000 high school students showed an increase in "false instagram sites"
Reports raised concerns about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of students have stated that they have a "main" account their parents know about
Every fifth child, at the age of 11 years, creates accounts in social networks that hide in front of their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in "false instagram accounts" where photographs are shared.
The reports indicate that there is concern about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students have stated that they have the "main account" they know about and at the same time have a private account.
One mother who attacked her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found that her puberty was urging others to "violate them."
Research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Association Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools showed that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-old students have two profiles, with half admitting that they are running private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It is worrying that he has so many teenagers trying to create online spaces where their parents and educators cannot find them.”
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish athletic committee
Elid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the annual General Meeting of the Steering Committee.
Doyle is the most rated light athlete and President Ian Beattie has described the move as a great opportunity for those who are in the management of sports as those who will benefit from her long experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilid has great respect for the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that it will be very beneficial for athletes in Scotland when he is a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am thrilled to be the voice of athletes and I hope to be truly successful and to help drive sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 and 400 metres in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, won a total of four gold medals and is now a regular expert at the BBC, could not go after a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I suffered an attack a month ago.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said it'd only be time to see if I'd get better or to what extent.
It's exhausting, but I've been able to heal myself, learn to walk again, and I can practice today!
Thank you for all the encouraging news."
Disposal of milk triggering comparison of mothers to cows shares views online
The company involved in the production of the desalination divided the online opinion of the advertising that compares pregnant mothers to pregnant cows.
In the context of the introduction of the "first silent portable outlet in the world", Envi has produced a music video with a cover showing the freedom that the new trailer gives to pregnant mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay with cows on a song with the text: “Yes, I feel, but you don’t see any oce” and “In case you don’t notice that I don’t have vomiting, my breasts are here.”
The congregation goes on to say: "Fump, pump, I feed, pump, pump, feed my sweet milk."
An advertisement that was published on the corporate facebook page, however, triggered an online controversial reaction.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and received mixed reactions from those who saw it, and many of them indicated that it sheds light on the "horror" of the dairy industry.
‘Very poor decision to misuse cows for advertising on this product.
Just like we have to be pregnant and give birth so they can give milk, but their children are taken a few days after birth," says one of the comments.
The Elvie Disposal is discreetly attached to the breast (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “Probably traumatic for the mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise on a breast pump for mothers who leave their children?"
Someone else added, "That advertisement is completely out."
They also found out who defended the advertising, and one woman admitted that the composition was considered 'infectious'.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd have the pump if I kept kicking.
I feel just like a cow when I'm being thrown away.
Advertising's a little crazy, but it's about the thing.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one user.
Another added: “It’s a fun commercial focused on mothers who are sucking milk (sometimes at work or in the toilet) and feel like “cows”.
It's not a commercial that's supposed to excite or destroy the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that they all dance with discreet detachments hidden under the bra.
The concept of campaigning is based on the observation that many women who are sucking their milk indicate that they feel like cows.
However, Elvie is completely silent, has no wires or curtains and is beautifully hidden in the bra on the waist, so gives women freedom of movement, the ability to hold the child and even walk when sending.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD for mothers, added the comment: “Elvie is so revolutionary a product that she deserves a significant and provocative market introduction.
By creating a parallel between waving mothers and lowering cows, we wanted to point to the sending of milk and all the challenges associated with it, while showing the fun and reliable sense of freedom that the new shipper will provide.
It's not the first time Elvie was sent to the station.
During the London fashion week, one of the two mothers of the designer Marta Jakubowski appeared on the mill, which was just using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to the state camp at the Texas border
The number of children detained migrants has increased sharply despite the fact that monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in particular because the hard rhetoric and principles introduced by Trump's administration have made it easier to locate children with follow-up.
Most of the escorts were traditionally created by immigrants without evidence, who were afraid of the possibility of staying in the country, so they claimed to belong to the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households must provide fingerprints and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested hundreds of people who had requested the status of the escort of the isolated unharmed.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
Up to 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or members of the sponsor's household are illegal in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue in their struggle," said Mr. Albence.
According to the asylum workers, the representatives of the children’s affairs were in a hurry to process new rules, which would require some of them to be brought before the court until the month before the detention, instead of the earlier standard 60 days.
A lot of people will appear through a video conference call instead of declaring their case legal status for the immigration judge.
Those who do not have an appeal for help will be deported quickly.
As long as the child is in custody, he is more likely to experience anxiety or depression, which may lead to outbreaks of the relationship or attempts to escape, the workers of asylum facilities are claiming and reporting from the system during the last few months.
Lawyers state that these concerns have been raised in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where there are signs that the child is working, with greater likelihood of not being noticed, precisely because of the size of the device.
They added that moving children into a camp without the time of emotional preparation or disengagement with friends could lead to a trauma with which many children are already fighting.
Syria announced that they should download immediately US, French and Turkish "occupational components"
During the general meeting of the United Nations, foreign minister Valid al-Moual also called for the return of Syrian refugees to their homes, even though the eight year war in the country has already taken place.
Moual, who is also a representative prime minister, said that foreign forces in the Syrian territory are illegal, under the pretext of combating terrorism and that "it will be imposed accordingly."
"They must give up immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Mouale insisted that "the war against terrorism in Syria is almost over", killing more than 360 000 people since 2011 and millions more lost their homes.
He said Damasek will continue in the "fighting in this holy battle until we rid all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "any illegally present foreigners."
The United States has some 2,000 units in Syria, mainly in schools of Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting with President Bashar al-Assad, and advises them.
France has more than 1,000 units in the war zone.
In issuing refugees, Mouale declared that they had good conditions for their return and accused "some Western countries" of the "widening of non-national concerns", which caused refugees to refuse to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organization to make these returns easier," he said.
"Police what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that no recovery aid would be available for Syria until there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
The United Nations diplomats state that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a security system in the last Idlib attack created an opportunity to move forward in political discussions further.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a major Syrian attack by Russian-protected forces in the province where three million people live.
Mouale, however, pointed out that the agreement has "clearly final terms" and expressed hope that the military move will focus on jihadists, including soldiers from Nusra Front with the Al-Qaeda link, who will be "declared".
The envoy of the United Nations Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of a new committee consisting of government members and opposition to the design of a military institution for Syria will soon be held and the elections will be postponed.
Moual laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited "to the control of the existing constitutions" and issued a warning against a breach.
Why Trump Wins the Second Period
According to this logic, Donald Trump would also win in the next election in 2020, unless the hope of many liberal observers, the complaint and the scandals of his office as president had not ended.
In such a case, it would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finals of the presidential period in history!"
So far, there's no sign of surveillance.
Since 2014, monitoring in the main broadcast time has doubled by more than 1.05 million to CNN and nearly tripled by 1.6 million to MSNBC.
Fox News has an average monitoring of 2.4 million in the main broadcast time, which is an increase of 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC has increased monitoring on cable TV to 3.5 million watching the main night news.
"It's a fire that people love, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the operator of the "Designed Survivor" series on the ABC drama about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovellová, an experienced comedy author and series “Just the Funny Parts: And a Five Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys”, has another theory.
He recalls driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why?
"She said, "Because she's funny about him," Mrs. Scovellová told me.
It's the importance of having fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story that is being played in the city of Washington could predict the future of Roe V. Wada, so that the immigrant families can be reunited again and in the interests of the global economy.
Disposal is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged trackers.
And yet it goes beyond the scope of whether you're an informed citizen when you watch a panel of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward uses the "deep backup" source for his book "Fair," smashing Paul Manafort's leather bundles worth $15,000 (“adrogance clothing” as Washington Post mentioned) and the consequences of Mr. Trump Storm Daniels' inaugural "anatomy".
Besides, I'm not going to look at Super Maria the same way again.

Money outside the most narrow domestic competitions of the Middle Ages
It is not surprising that the 17th section of Pennsylvania, after the financial crisis, is experiencing the reorganization of the congresses, which generated two officials in the fight against the same chair.
This recently led to the transformation of the Pittsburg district into the periodic democratic republic of Conor Lamb, which gained another district in the special election last year in the spring.
Lamb stands against another holder of the office, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is heavily covered with a new 17.
After the highest Pennsylvania court ruled in January that the old districts were permanently divided for the benefit of the Republicans, there was a mapping.
In the new 17th district, the competition began with a strong financial gap between the main parties' financial interests, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the March special elections to the 18th Congressional District.
This chair was occupied by the Republican for more than a decade and Donald Trump won 20 points in the county.
Political experts give the Democrats a little push.
America Considers to punish Salvador for supporting China, then resigns
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing under the mild pressure of Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and was staying at the hotel in Panama, until partners had passed the organizational team Trump's leadership.
The representatives of the foreign ministries decided to withdraw the US leaders of the diplomatic mission from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "the recent decisions not to know Tchaj-wan further," spokesperson Heather Nauertová stated in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
However, the sanctions were considered only against Salvador, which received US aid of US$ 140 million in 2017, including drugs control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial assistance and aimed at limiting visas, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and the number of murders.
With continued internal negotiations, the North American and Central American representatives have postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity linked to similar previous year's negotiations, which was outlined as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
By mid-September, however, the senior executives explained that they wanted to continue in the negotiations and effectively finish any consideration of the disciplines for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now in charge of the resolution of the conference currently scheduled for mid-October, as part of a signal that the board of directors is calling, the diplomats have introduced.
And three American envoys returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without having any new unbridled news from Washington.
The White House speaker, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American representatives, including two diplomats, who agreed with the debate on internal negotiations on the conditions of anonymity.
Their sources were confirmed by an external analyst who was close to the government executive and also spoke under the terms of anonymity.
Study history
The report of Robert Mueller from the Special Committee on the possible prevention of Mr Trump in the exercise of his right, which is now in the public records of many evidence, could be a definitive scrapping of the cancer.
In his investigation, Mr Mueller allegedly also turned to whether Mr. Trump's campaign did not include a secret agreement with Russia regarding the attack on our elections.
If there was a foreign exchange in Congress, Mr Trump would have to submit to responsibility before this body, just as he is preparing to appear before the voters again, and finally the jury of his colleagues would have to wait for him.
This is a whole series of 'if', and I do not want to say that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable – as in similar policies in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice that will affect how long suffering will last.
In 1938 the German officials were prepared to arrange a march against Hitler, only to be built and supported by the Western powers in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years of full bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such critical moments that speed up or slow down the inexorable pace of democracy.
The Americans are now facing a number of similar critical moments.
What are we gonna do if Mr. Trump fires Mr. Rod Rosenstein's deputy attorney, this is the man who runs Mr. Mueller's trial?
Rosenstein had been moved since the report announced that last year he had proposed to secretly record the president and speculated that he was not in a state of health so that he could stop the president's office.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the versions of The Times are incomplete.
“How do we react if the newly requested investigation of F.B.I. Bretta Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or what if he is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite a credible charge of sexual assault and false statements?
And what's most important, will we elect in the mid-term of the functional period to Congress, which will assign responsibility to Mr. Trump?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will wait a long dark night.
But I believe we're wrong, and that's because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and about 60 years later, she sent me on Saturday to light candles on the table with a pillow.
How could I not be optimistic about our future with such an inheritance?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic about shooting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers on Thursday of the Rapid Viennese guest, aware that the victory over the Rakušana would have given them a great hope in the process of the Group of the European League after an impressive remix in Spain at the Villarreal field earlier this month.
The knee wound has prevented Deputy Graham Dorrans from showing up in the season for the first time until 2-2 with Villarreel. However, they believe that Rangers can use this result as a reflection bridge for larger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a quality team," said a 31-year-old player.
“We went into a fight with the faith that we could do something, and we took the point.
We may have been able to reproduce it at the end, but the total remission was probably just.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second, we got better and we were better.
It will be another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it'll be hard, because in the last match they've won a good outcome.
Last year was pretty hard, with all my injuries and changes at the club, but now I have a very good feeling about it.
The team's strong, and the guys are really enjoying it, and the training's fine.
I hope that we can fix this now, throw the last season behind our heads, and we'll be successful."
Women are worried about saving their pensions
Although the participants had a clear idea of how to care for them, few people talked to family members about it.
Half of the people in the nationwide study reported that they had discussed the price of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10% said she talked to her children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't decide to discuss it with him," explains Holly Snyder, vice-president of the state life insurance company.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care unless you first reveal your wishes to them.
Find out where and how to take care with your counselor and family, because these factors can play a major role in determining the price.
Admit your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you find a way to earn these expenses.
Long-term care can be financed by, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid cash life insurance, which will help you pay these expenses, or by using your own funds – while you have money.
Create your legal documents: Forbid legal battles as long as it goes.
Identify your healthcare representative, which will be a reliable person who will look after your medical care and ensure that your doctor will comply with your wishes unless you are able to communicate yourself.
Consider, too, the description of full power for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make a financial decision for you and ensure that your accounts are kept if you are not eligible for it.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your old parent needs medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan to prepare.
"There are not only finances in the game, but, for example, what are they called healers?" asks Martin.
‘Where are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have that plan ready by hand."
The man in Ilfracombe was shot several times by an airman.
When a man walked home after a nighttime break, he was hit by a few shots from the airfield.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon when it was shot into the chest, chest and arms.
Police described the shooting that took place around 02:30 BST as "a convenient act".
The victim of the attack didn't count.
The victim's injury is not a threat to his life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died during a severe earthquake and tsunamis that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. According to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to increase.
Since communication is out of operation, the auxiliary units could not obtain any information from the Dongal Regent, which is the area north of Pal, which is closer to the epicenter of earthquakes of 7.5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Paul after the disaster.
Here are several key facts about the city of Paul and the Regent of Dongal, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the main city of the province of Central Sulawesi, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi and its population was estimated to be 379,800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
It reached a regent stretching more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast on the northwestern island of Sulawesi.
Regent, the administrative region under the province, had a population of 299 200 in 2017.
The main components of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Dongal.
In the province there is also an important interest in nickel, which, however, concentrates mainly on Morowali on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Dongal have already hit the tsunamis several times over the last 100 years.
In 1938 the tsunamis in Dongal killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Tsunami hit the west of Dongali in 1996, when she asked for nine victims.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Ohni Circle and is regularly on the ground floor.
Here is a list of several major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the northern part of Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that struck 14 countries and prepared for the lives of 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in the province of Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the Sumatran coast.
2006: Earthquakes of 6,8 hit them gradually from Indonesia's most remote Java island and caused tsunamis that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: Earthquake of force 7.6 hit a degree near Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people came to life.
2010: Earthquake of force 7.5 hit one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra and caused tsunamis of 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and prepared for the lives of about 300 people.
2016: A slight earthquake struck the Regent of Pidie Jaya in the province of Aceh and caused destruction and panic because people were reminded of the devastating effects of the earthquake and tsunamis of 2004.
This time, she didn't make any noise, but over 100 died because of falling buildings.
2018: Strong earthquake hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, where it killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists imprisoned temporarily.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin's prisoner for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Alaskan governors and vice-presidents of Sarah Palin, was arrested for charges of assault.
According to a report issued by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, 29-year-old Palin living in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspecting domestic violence, violating domestic violence and preventing arrest.
According to the police report, when his female acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he picked up her phone.
Palin was sent to Mat-Su Pretril Facility and is held on an unsecured bond of USD 500, says KTUU.
According to the network report, he appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared that he felt "decidedly innocent" when asked for a statement.
Fuel faces three Class A violations, which means it could be sentenced to a year's imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000.
At the same time, he was accused of a Class B infringement, which was punishable by one-day imprisonment and fine of USD 2000.
It's not the first time that Palin has to face a criminal notice.
In December 2017 he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palina.
The alleged attack on the police reported his mother's phone call, Sarah Palin.
The case is now before the Alaskan war veteran court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of violating the reporting of domestic violence, and of holding arms under the influence of ombudsmen in connection with the incident.
He probably hit his girlfriend's face.
In 2016, Sarah Palinová was criticised by a group of war veterans when her son’s violent behavior was associated with a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his son’s service in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunamis: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Earthquake of force 7.5 gradually caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are out of operation and the numbers of victims are expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit directly on the shooting of the part of the island of Sulawesi, located north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
A video showing the moment of the earthquake appeared on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand an exceptional death penalty for the suspected terrorist attack in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York apply for the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York, where eight people died – this is an exceptional punishment that has not been granted for federal crimes in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly carried out an attack on the cycle along the West Side Highway in the quarter of Lower Manhattan using the rented truck Home Depot, which had broken down pedestrians and cyclists.
In order for the plaintiffs to defend the death penalty, they will have to prove that Saipov "intensely" killed eight victims and "intensely" caused a number of injuries – this is how the conditions are defined for the purpose of granting the death penalty according to a document approved by the Southern District of New York Court.
According to the court documents, both of these numbers would mean the possibility of a death penalty.
Several weeks after the attack, the Federal High Court accused Saipova of 22 criminal acts, including charges of murder in favour of extortion, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "significant planning and preparation", the plaintiffs claim and describe the way Saipov did the act as cruel, cruel and repugnant."
“Sayfully Habibullaevic Saipov caused the injury, pain and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadov, Darrena Drake, Ariel Erlijov, Hernana Ferruchi, Hernana Diego Mendozy and Alejandro Damiana Pagnucca,” is hereby appointed.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the court of the Southern District of New York last committed the death penalty.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but finally he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was actually executed in connection with the federal case in New York in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were repaired, which proved conspiracy for the purpose of espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs sat on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a relative from Uzbekistan, appeared in court documents during the days and months following the attack of minimal regret.
According to the police, he said he felt good about what he did.
According to Saipov's accusations, he told the authorities that he was inspired by the monitoring of videos of the Islamic State on the phone to commit the attack.
The police also announced that they were also demanding an extension of the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital room.
He declared that he felt innocent about 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "evidently disappointed" with the decision of the complainants.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting the confession of guilt and the condemnation of life without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of those events for everyone concerned," Patton said.
Saip's defence team already asked the plaintiff not to demand the death penalty.
According to MEPs, the Conservative Party should be entrusted with the Brexit of NIGEL FARAGE
During today's protest at the Conservative Party Conference, Nigel Farage committed to "mobilizing the army of the people".
The former leader of the UK Independence Party stated that politicians must "sympathize" with the Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May's own MEPs proposed, he should be conducting negotiations with the EU.
The row Conservative MP Peter Bone announced on his way to Birmingham that the Great Britain would be out now, if he was a secretary for Brexit Mr. Farage.
But the problem that Mrs May is facing in the direction of her ranks, where a deep gap prevails, has still highlighted the conservatives fighting for a coup in the EU, who have joined a self-defense protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan from the Chequers in the course of the attacks of the Brexit forces, the Union's determinants and the EU's own.
The allies insist that they will continue to seek agreement with Brussels regardless of the consequences – and will force Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between their package and their 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone said that the Leave Means Leave group was meeting in Solihul where he wanted to go to the Chequers.
He suggested to Mr Farage that he should become a representative and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he were in the front, we'd be out today," he said.
The Ambassador Wellingborough added, "I'm going to stand for Brexit, but we have to get out of Chequers."
To show his resistance to the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to listen.
In our own country we want to do our own laws."
Mr. Bone has rejected the proposals that the public opinion has changed since the vote in 2016: 'The idea that British citizens would change their opinion and wish to abstain is quite simple.'
The Brexit Conservatory Andrea Jenkins, who also took part in the tour, told reporters: ,I'm just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Checkers are not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him and they don't like him as members of our party or our activists who are currently filling the streets for us to be elected at all.
Forget about the Chequers and start listening.’
In a sharp report for Mrs Mayo, she says, "Ministers will keep their place when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage stated that conservative policies must be "attended to an unpleasant situation" if they wish to betray their decisions taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us – people – and our political class," he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're standing here today to tell them that we won't let you.'
In his report, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the edge of Brexit, to feel pressure.
"Now we are mobilizing the army of the people of this country, which has assured us of victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become independent and proud of the Great Britain, who will rule alone."
In the meantime, members of the Union's riot forces marched at Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists had transparency of the Conservatives against Brexit after the weekend of the operation of this party.
Labour MP Lord Adonis laughed at the conservatives because of the security problems of the party's application after the conference began.
"These are people who, according to their own words, can provide IT systems and technology for Canada plus, for trouble free trade in Ireland," he added.
"The whole thing's a spray.
There's nothing like a good Brexit,' he added.
Warren is planning to think about the candidacy of the president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections, "he will think about the presidential candidacy perfectly".
Boston Globe reports that a democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future on Saturday at the council in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, the frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is trying to re-election November against the Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired by Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It felt in the centre of speculation that Trump could be built in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the volunteers at the council since Trump was in the office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to resign from the presidency.
Warren said it was time for women to go out to Washington and make our broken government, which means a woman in the highest position.
Suspect was arrested from shooting Simse from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that she held a suspect from the Friday shooting of the basketball player team LSU Wayda Simse.
The police department in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of 20-year-old Ditheon Simpson, at 11:00 Conference ET news.
A video from the Friday shooting was issued requesting the identification of the man captured on the recording.
Sims, 20, was shot on Friday in the early hours near the campus of the University of Southern.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound that didn’t matter with his life,” police commander Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via web 247sports.
Wayde tried to protect his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to moving to the scene, had a gun and admitted to shooting Waydea Simse.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and taken into custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
6 feet and 6 inches high Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 matches, of which 10 were last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 points for the match.
Great price Russia: Lewis Hamilton approached the world's champion title when the team regime joined him in the hand of victory over Sebastian Vettel
As soon as Valtteri Bottas graduated on Saturday before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes' team regime would play a major role in the race.
From the position field, Bottas had a good start and almost got rid of Hamilton when in the first two rounds he defended his position and called on Vettel to attack the team's party.
The Vettel entered the depot as the first one and let Hamilton pull the cars running at the edge of the group, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes driver went to the depot about the wheel later and was classified as Vettel after the departure. However, Hamilton stepped out ahead and in the close battle the Ferrari driver had to leave the inner road free so that he could defend himself in the third round after the double maneuver.
Max Verstappen emerged from the back row of the field and at the end of the first round he was on his 21st birthday in command.
He then led a large part of the race because he held the original tires as long as possible to focus on the fast finish and could take Kim Raikkonen's fourth position.
Finally, he went to the depot in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight wheels he could no longer increase the pace and Raikkonen remained the fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend, and when he got a warrant, he acted like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done fantastic work and the reward is the first two places," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad word.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Feinstein's Saturday meeting because she insisted that she did not publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing the candidate of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During his speech at a meeting in West Virginia, he did not mention directly the statement given to Ford before the Senate's judicial commission, instead of declaring that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "evil and rebellious and slander."
“One thing that could happen, and the wonderful thing that is happening in the last days in Sennar, when you see that attitude, when you see those people as angry and evil and repugnant and slander,” he said.
“When you look at the edition and the publication and they tell you, well, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, can you get out of here?
Remember her answer... you published the document – ,uh,uh,what?
Oh, no.
She didn't publish."
Well, wait a minute.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Feinstein sent Ford's letter with details of the charge against Kavanaugh in July and the information escaped at the beginning of September – but Feinstein refused to leave her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's call, nor did I disclose any information about the case," said Clovisie Feinstein, as The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep everything secret and I did exactly what she asked me to do."
However, according to her words, the president, who expressed himself at the meeting on Saturday night, said: “I will tell you that this is a serious wrong speech.
Maybe she didn't, but anyway, it's the worst word of the body I've ever seen."
The President continued to defend the candidate to the Supreme Court, which three women accused of sexual harassment, and indicated that the Democrats were using these accusations for their own purposes.
‘They are determined to take too much back any available means.
You see the subterfuge, the disgrace, they care who's going to hurt who's going to get back to the country to get back to power and to the cord," the Mediaite president quoted the words.
Elitní liga: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made a Friday victory in the Elite League against Belfast Giants won a Saturday party in Dundee, which ended 5-3.
Giants were soon caught by double-legged leadership due to Patrick Dwyer's and Francis Beauvillier's attacks.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie managed to balance home before Dwyer returned to the Giants.
Francois Bouchard then again compared the two branches of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen to their victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League in the season for the Adam Keefe team, which took place on Friday in Belfast Dundee to defeat 2-1.
Both teams met in the season, with all three previous matches controlled by the Giants players.
Dwyer's first branch came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, for Kendall McFaull's assistance, while David Rutherford signed up for Beauvilleer's second goal four minutes later.
The first third was wild when Sullivan got home to play back at 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt prepared a target for Cownie, who compared at 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, Giants went to the cabin for the first break only when he recorded his second goal at the end of the first third.
The house was regrouped, and Bouchard was again happy to settle his head from the mission game at 27:37.
The joint work of Cownie and Charles Corcoran later helped Nielsen in the second third of the game to stop running on Dundee's side, and the tennis player assured his team's leadership in half of the final third.
Giants who have now lost a fourth of the last five matches will play another match at Milton Keynes on Friday.
The air traffic manager died to allow hundreds of people aboard the aircraft to avoid earthquakes
The leading flight in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he died, watching to make sure that a plane can be safely taken by hundreds of people aboard the ship.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing after a massive earthquake caused by tsunamis on Friday.
Strong subsequent quakes flooded the area, and many people remained trapped in the troubled cities of Paul.
But although his colleagues of the twenty-year-old Anthonyus Gunawana Agunga fled to save their lives, he refused to leave his place in the wild with the driving tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pal.
He remained in his position to make sure that the flight of Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at the time on the edge, could safely fly.
Then he jumped out of the control tower down when he thought he was going to dry.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, spokesperson for air traffic, told Australia ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We prepared a helicopter transport from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, where he was transferred to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, this morning he died before the helicopter reached Paul.
"Our hearts are broken by this report," he added.
In the meantime, the responsible authorities expressed concern that the number of deaths could be achieved by thousands. The Agency responsible for disaster management indicated that access to the city of Dongal, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number of deaths continues to increase, as many bodies remain unexplained and many of them still have no saviors,” spokespersons Sutopo Purvo Nugro said.
The waves in the devastated Palu have reached heights up to six meters. In the city, mass funerals will be held on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft take to the affected points of assistance and delivery.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said at Sky News station: “Every minute the ambulance brings in other bodies.
There's a lack of drinking water.
Small stores are stolen all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, leader of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find in the place.
It's a tragedy, but it could be even worse."
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo came to Paul on Sunday and told the country’s military personnel: “I ask you to work day and night and complete all the tasks needed to evacuate.
Are you ready?" CNN introduced.
Indonesia was hit this year by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people were killed.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that one person is missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline operating the flight that was in a camp on one of the Pacific microné islands now stated that one person was missing, at first stating that all passengers and crew with a total of 47 persons were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in the press report that on Saturday afternoon she was unable to find a traveling man.
The airline reported that it cooperates with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in the search for a lost man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the requirements for the provision of details of this passenger, his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane entered the water while attempting to land on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, the officials claimed that a total of seven people had been transferred to the hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and were all in a stabilised condition.
What caused the accident and the exact outcome of the event, however, remains unclear.
The U.S. airline and shipping company stated that the plane arrived in the camp even before the landing route.
Some witnesses thought the plane was passing by.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was landing at very low altitudes.
"That was very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes further stated that together with the others, he managed to get water from a deep stream to the emergency exits of the aircraft.
He added that the crew panicked and shouted and that he himself suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that mariners working near the port mill had helped to rescue by means of an inflating boat that was carried by passengers on the coast before the plane sank to about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from Aviation Safety Network indicate that over the last two decades, aircraft with a total of 111 registration mark died, but no accidents occurred with Air Niuguni.
The analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The complaint on Saturday ended its speech in this case in which a man is repeatedly sentenced to fire a woman living in Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Ministry of Justice in person of his analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours and provided expert judgements in the field of intelligence analysis.
An analysis for the jury planned a scenario using the records from the phone 29 of the accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett stated that he had received location data from several mobile phones, which showed that Tellis was on the night of her death in Chambers, which was contrary to his previous statement, introduced The Clarion Ledger.
When it was found that he spent the night with Chambers on a mobile phone, he pointed out that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, and then the police visited him.
Sanford stood before the courtroom and testified that the day in question wasn't in town.
When the plaintiffs asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said, "He's lying, because my car was in Nashville that night."
Another accident was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
However, the cell phone records indicate that the two knew each other only for a week.
Rowlett stated that shortly after the death of Chambers Tellis, he removed Chambers' text messages, phone calls and contact information from his phone.
"He took her all out of his life," Hale said.
The defense will begin its final speech on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the case to be brought before the jury later that day.
High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
Hip Hopo's triumph wants to deal with negative views of this genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The Chapel of High Breed from Bristol claims that the hip hop moved from its beginnings with political messages and solutions to social problems.
So they want to go back to the roots and repopulate the conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons have recently met with the revitalization of artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the United Kingdom.
Another black girl?
Newer complains about his "racist" text message
A New Yorker complains about his discrimination after receiving a missent text message from his mother, in which he was labeled a "more black" text message.
A few refused to be racist and compared to the "scoffering" complaint.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when the first day at work in 2016 found that the new educator of her children, Giselle Maurice, was black.
“NOEEEÉÉÉÉÉ, OTHER NETHER NETHERLANDS”, wrote P. Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in the text report.
However, instead of sending her husband twice, Maurice sent her a drink.
When she understood her false passport, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman threw Mrs. Maurice out and said that she was just leaving the educator who was an African American, working really badly and that she was expecting the Philippines instead, introduced the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one job and was sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice complains about compensation for work out and asks for a compensation of USD 350 per day of a six-month commitment for which she was initially hired, even though without a contract.
"I want to show them that this isn't happening," Post said this Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
However, the two returned the attack by not being racist, but that the termination of Ms. Maurice's employment was an appropriate measure because they were afraid that after that attack they could no longer believe her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We are no racists," said her husband, Joel Plasco, post.
"But would you place your child in the hands of someone to whom you looked down on, even though it was wrong?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the complaint to "breathing" and stated that his wife had cared for only two months of her old child and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Would you like to ride like this?
It's not a nice thing at all," the investment banker said.
Even though the judge still persists, the jury on the social media quickly condemned the two for their behavior and logic.
The storytellers about the bear Paddington were afraid that readers would be incompatible with the talking bear, showing the latest news.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, told the reporter: “It is difficult to feel the situation of someone who reads it first, even before the publication.
It's very fun to know, but now that we know the great success of the Spider Paddyton."
She stated that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before being inspired to write a children's book about a little gas bear, was very disappointed that his work had been rejected, added a publication on the 60th anniversary, which became a "sweet" leak after his death last year.
To Paddington, described as “a very important member of her family”, she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"I was a very quiet person, never was any exaggeration," she said.
“But because Paddington was so realistic for him, it was like having a child who achieved something you can really be proud of.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success in this respect.
Even though it was only his creation and imagination, he always tried to attribute all his achievements only to Paddington."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon arrival, her daughter was quickly transferred to Louise Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors were trying to save her life.
“He called me regularly to tell me that it was really wrong and that he didn’t expect her to get out of it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
“Then I should have called from Nada, where she told me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say good-bye to her.
That's how I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be there with you soon.
I'll be there with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart moving slowly lost their effectiveness and left her body.
She died shortly after, and it was like everything was closed.
I just had to sit there and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it in me."
After all, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, now suffering the loss of her daughter, has entered the plane with other passengers, without revealing what a difficult test is just going on.
"No one knew," she said.
“I kept my head shut, my eyes were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was just during the summer that I felt a tremendous understanding for Nadda.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sufficeing women send their glances to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones as a result of suicide cooperate to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending the views of the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers on which people can look for support.
Mrs. Davis' son was only 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and, as a result, took his own life in 18 years.
"I don't want any other parent to feel what I felt every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said that her son was given a young cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile could shed light on every room."
However, he left his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place”.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found the unstable body of his relative after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis says, “I am constantly afraid of what it will have to do with his life.”
Ms. Davis’s comments “to inform people that they have people who are willing to help and can talk to them, even if it is about their friends.
Don't be silent – you need to talk."
Mrs Humphreys, who is the flying friend of Mrs Davies, lost Mark, who was her 15-year-old partner, shortly after his mother died.
"Nothing told me she was feeling at the bottom or depressed, nothing at all," she explains.
“A few days before Christmas, we observed a change in his behavior.
It was the worst day – when the kids opened the presents, and they didn't even look at them, nothing."
She stated that her partner’s death was a tremendous trauma to them, but that she had to gradually get: “This can be done in the family with a complete hole.
It broke us up.
But we all have to go on and fight."

The future of Bretta Kavanaugh depends on the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought we could get something that we actually asked for - a time-limit investigation, with limited scope - we could introduce a little unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would "disappear" because both sides would be buried in the partial positions.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to start an investigation?
Their resistance is well timed.
Elections in the middle of the election period are only five weeks away from us, November 6, and if the Republicans are mistakenly expected, it will lead to their fundamental weakening in trying to get the man requested to post them to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called the senators, lobbyed them for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked in the White House for President Bush, and through him met his wife Ashley, who was then Bush's personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI gets his message?
The Senate will vote on this and there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear, however, whether Mr Kavanaugh in the Senate can obtain at least 50 votes, which has enabled Vice-President Mike Pence to break the motion and confirm it at the Supreme Court.
Number of refugees from North Korea to Kim "decided"
The number of refugees from North to South Korea since the beginning of the Kim Chong-Un government has fallen seven years ago, the South Korean legislator claims.
Park Byeong-seug, with a quote from the South Korean Union Ministry, stated that in the last year there were 1127 flights – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park further stated that there are more stringent controls at the borders between North Korea and China and higher rates of required passengers at the borders.
Pchjongangang has not issued any public statements to that effect.
The vast majority of refugees from the North today receive an offer for the South Korean citizenship.
Saul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border.
Most of them run across China, with which North Korea has the longest border, and it is easier to cross than in the hard protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between both Koreas.
China's on refugees tends to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often is forced to return.
The relationship between the North and the South, which are still technically in war, has improved considerably in recent months.
This month, leaders met both countries in Pchjongang for talks that focused on stopped denuclearization negotiations.
This was the historic June meeting of the US President Donald Trump and Kim Chong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on extensive conditions of cooperation in the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong accused the United States of failing to make any progress on the issue of sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way to cease to arm ourselves unilaterally," Ri said in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosiová called Bretta Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said it was inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court
The leader of the democratic minority, Nancy Pelosiová, called the candidate of the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh "hysterical" and stated that due to its temperament it was not suitable for the service of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this comment in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could not help, but if any woman had performed such a theatre, she would be called "hysterical," Pelosi said in her response to Kavanaugh's Thursday statement before the Senate's judicial commission.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all the charges that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at the time they were both in puberty.
During his opening words, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and excited about his family and his years at high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and stated that their accusations against him were "a major and coordinated attack" by organised liberals who were unable to pass through Hillary Clinton's death in the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosova stated that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he was unable to work at the Supreme Court because he showed that he was suspected of being against the Democrats.
"I think he himself has been disqualified by these declarations and by the way he supported the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosova answered the question as to whether it would attempt to withdraw Kavanaugh in the event of his confirmation, even if the Democrats had received the majority of representatives in the House of Commons.
“I will tell you this – if Congress is not telling the truth, then he is not qualified not only for work at the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he is working now,” Pelosiová said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. District Court of Appeal.
Pelosís added that as a democrat she was concerned about the potential yield of Kavanaugh in court at the Law on Acceptable Care or Roe vs. Wade because it was considered a conservative judge.
As part of the hearing of his previous confirmation in Kavanaugh's function, he avoided the answer to the question whether he would have failed some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"There is no time for a hysterical person to appear before the court and expect us to say "Jee, that's beautiful," Pelosi said.
And women have to rule that.
After a verbal accident, months, and years of drought, she was unable to escape without crying.
"We cry when we have a relationship," Mrs. Steinem told me about 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
She continues: “I was helped by a woman who was working with the director and who told me that she was also crying when she had a relationship, but she made a certain technique, which means that when she had a relationship and started crying, the person she was talking to said: “You may think I’m crying because I’m sad.
But I have a relationship."
And that's how she kept doing it.
And I think it's great."
The tears are acceptable as a means of reacting to anger, partly because they are not understood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job, where I worked in the office where men dominated, and I once expressed my indescribable attitude with tears, but the older, always the cold manager, who was always a bit afraid, caught me by the neck and dragged me to the backyard.
"Never tell them you're crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're right.
He thinks you're sad and they'll be glad to have you."
Patricia Schroeder, once a democratic congressman from Colorado, cooperated with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught up in a non-marriage affair on board the Monkey Business ship and had to get out of the fight. Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she could not examine the idea of her own presidential candidacy.
"It wasn't a well-thought decision," she said with a smile after 30 years.
"There have already been seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow and seven peacocks."
Because the campaign has been running for a long time, it has not been able to take a step towards receiving contributions and thus committed itself not to getting into the fight unless it has received $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1,000 to the male candidate would only give her $250.
"Do you think I'll get a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally carry out the campaign, she was completely overcome by her emotions – as an expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration by a system that made it difficult to obtain money and to focus on the voters rather than on the delegates and the relation to sexism, that she was fully involved.
"You might think I was nervous," Mrs. Schroeder said about how the press reacted to her.
“And maybe you would think that my main sponsor was Kleinex.
I remember thinking what they might write me on the tombstone.
"Weeping"?"
Why can China-American trade war be good for Beijing
The initial Salvador of trade wars between the United States and China was overwhelming, and even though the battle is not far off, according to experts, the gap between countries has been beneficial in the long term for Beijing.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, gave his first warning this year by issuing Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
Most of the most important escalations, however, saw the light of the world this week, when new tariffs were announced for goods of USD 200 billion ($150 billion), which virtually means taxing half of Chinese trade exports to the USA.
Beijing has always responded, with a recent five to ten percent reduction in customs tariffs from US$ 60 billion.
China has been trying to pay the US the same coin and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world would fall on its knees.
Even if China wanted Washington to return to its original rounds, it would mean meeting his requirements, but the public details of the US requirements would be completely humiliating for China's President Si Xin-Pching.
However, experts believe that if Beijing could play its cards correctly, the US trade war could positively support China in the long term because it would reduce the interdependence of these two economies.
"The fact is that a rapid political decision by Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would leave economic outflows in both countries. This is much more dangerous than observers have so far allowed," said Abigail Grace, a research workshop focusing on Asia in the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, foreign minister
Syria argues that it is prepared to return refugees voluntarily and calls for assistance in rebuilding a country that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
During the talk at the UN Foreign Minister Valid al-Moual at the Valne Assembly, he stated that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today's situation in the area is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas of destroyed terrorists to a normal state.
Now all the conditions for voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism are met, as well as the unilateral economic measures that have focused on their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that Syria has left more than 5.5 million inhabitants since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country with the need for humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moual stated that the Syrian regime welcomes any assistance in the construction of a devastated country.
However, he stressed that we should not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe has firmly responded to the victory in Ryder Cup in Paris
The Evria team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the US team with the final score 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National team on the edge of the difficulty in France.
The United States has now lost its sixth in Europe, so it has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again won a crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn with his team reached 14.5 points needed for the U.S. defeat.
The United States Star, Phil Mickelson, who suffered most of the tour, then fired the ball into the water for 3 pairs of 16 jackets and left the victory of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari then stared in all his wheels and became one of 4 players and achieved the best result 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was approved in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 players of the European team with the lowest score, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's most rated player Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter from England, who successfully graduated his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran eight Ryder Cups, Spain Sergio Garcia became the best European player with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help today.
It's been a tough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I'm so happy, really happy I got the cup back.
Everything depends on the team, I'm glad I could help," Garcia said after the victory of Europe.
He gave a cup to his countryman John Rampo, who defeated the American legend of Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
"I feel an incredible pride in defeating Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching this guy," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now recorded a career record 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics of one of the best players of all time who won 14 of the biggest titles, which can be compared only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find a fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a peak golf course throughout the tournament.
“ I’m really proud of the boys, ” said Captain Jim Fury of the U.S.
This morning, we really warmed Europe up.
We really didn't make it.
I'll take my hat off Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will regroup and, in cooperation with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee, move forward.
I like those 12 guys, I'm glad I could make them a captain.
I really need to get out of here.
You beat us."
