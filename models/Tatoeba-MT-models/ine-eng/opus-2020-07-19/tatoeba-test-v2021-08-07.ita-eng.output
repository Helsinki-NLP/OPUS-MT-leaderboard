White pedone at f3, black pedone at e6, white pedone at g4, black pedone at h4 - matt chess! This is a jokely indicated in scacic circles as "the mat of shock".
White: Torre in a1, pedoné in b6, re in c8. Black: pedonos in a7 and b7, king in a8, alpha in b8. White puts the opponent in zugzwang by playing the tower in a6, after the Nero has only two options: take the tower in a6 or move its alpha in any other chess on the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the White makes its pedone move from b6 to b7 and gives a thin chess. In the second situation, the white tower takes the black pedon in a7, with the same result.
