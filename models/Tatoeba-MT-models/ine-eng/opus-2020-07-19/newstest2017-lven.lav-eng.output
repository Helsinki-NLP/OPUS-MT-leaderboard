28-year-old spring found dead in San Francisco supermarket
This week a 28-year-old spring was found in a large-scale staircase that recently moved to San Francisco .
But the victim's brother says he can't imagine anyone who wants to do more than his brother, saying, "His life has finally begun to improve."
On Wednesday at the University of Westfield, a young man was identified as 28-year-old Sanfresco resident Frank Galicia, a representative of the Sanfresco Judicial Medical Expert Office.
The San Francisco police announced that his death was recognized as a murder and an investigation is under way.
The victim's brother Luis Galicia tells the San Francisco radio station ABC KGO that Frank had previously worked for a famine in Boston, but six months ago he was at his dream work restaurant "Sons & Daughters" San Francisco.
The representative of the "Sons & Daughters" restaurant informs that the news of his death shocked them and stumbled them.
"We are a small team working as a family and we are very short," said the representative.
At this difficult time, we think about being with Frank’s friends and family.
Luis Galicia says that at first, Frank has been in the hostel, but in recent years, life has finally improved.
"He moved into the new apartment and met a girl," Luis tells the radio station to the KGB.
Luis Galicia claims that he does not know who would want to do something about his younger brother.
He was a good man with a wide heart.
"He's always fooled his family by making delicious meals and cooking lunch," said Luis Galicia
He never wanted to get involved in disputes.
He was the brother who adapted himself to others.
"In view of everything that has gone fast in the world, he was like an unwrought diamond, which muffled almost every day," he says.
Anyone who has information about the event is invited to call the SFPD Information Phone 415-575-4444.
New Doctor's Strike: Call for New Protests
New doctors' representatives ask their trade union to launch protests in the dispute over the new contract.
The British Medical Association (LMA) New Committee of Doctors (JAK) is preparing to request advice to support more protests early in September.
JAK believes that ministers have not been able to raise doubts about the contract.
In July, new doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by LMA.
Against the Treaty, 58% of all the members who took part in the vote voted.
In a message published on Thursday evening on Twitter, JAK Council member Elén Maccorta points out that the government continues to keep silent on this issue and therefore the contract offer has been rejected.
She said: "In view of this, the JAK vote has resulted in a complete rejection of the contract proposal and a decision has been taken to request new formal negotiations to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the government's silence, JAK today formally requested a meeting with the LMA Council to authorize the development of new contracts to enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, the new doctors participated in six strikes, including the first time in the NHS history that they stopped working.
Following the vote rejecting the terms of the agreement proposed by the LMA recommended by the BMA, the new doctor’s representative, Dr. Johans Malavana, withdrew from office.
Before meeting 54,000 young doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and will be accepted.
After the vote, the Secretary of Health, Jeremy Hunts, announced that the contract would be concluded with English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: Away Alliances?
The anger that ended the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to discuss and report on the end of the eight-month term and economic sanctions war.
But thanks to Turkish leaders in St. Petersburg, Vladimir Putin felt that Ankara needed these partnerships more.
However, they were both shocked.
Vladimir Putin’s smile looked like a puzzle and did not cause warm emotions, even in view of his normal resistance.
On the other hand, the view of Tayjips Erdogan at least five times called Putin his " dear friend", the news meeting.
I'm sick of the number.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve until the pre-crisis level, but will become even stronger.
On the next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan acted as if nothing had happened.
I think his enthusiasm is causing conflicting feelings.
But Putina’s glowing voice shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the landing of a Russian plane on the Syrian border.
At that time, Moscow responded.
Putin accused Ankara of putting a dance in Moscow’s back.
The overdose was even more painful, given that it came from a friend.
It will be very difficult to regain true trust, perhaps even impossible.
Since November Russia's public position has changed.
For several months, government-controlled television spread aggressive accusations against Ankara.
Suddenly, there seemed to be Turks.
The most serious accusation was that Erdogan’s family had benefited from the illegal oil trade with the controlled Syrian part of the Islamic State.
He rejected it himself, of course.
But St. Petersburg’s main message is that the time has come to forget the past.
Finally, this meeting was only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could view it as a victory of its own kind.
The benefits of the Ankara Peace Agreement are evident.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after a failed turnover last month, where he tried to gas.
countless terrorist attacks have also undermined his position.
There are also economic reasons.
Russian sanctions have caused substantial losses, in particular the ban on charter travel, which usually ensures the flow of several million Russian tourists to Turkish resorts each year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Russian tour operators and charter companies will also be relieved when regular flights are renewed.
They look forward to the holiday heat in the Mediterranean according to the season.
Already this week, national TV plans to reduce the prices of fruit and vegetables, as Turkey's imports of fruit and vegetables will be renewed.
As the local newspaper Vedemosti quoted: "Tourists for them, tomatoes for us."
However, the visit also had other political motives on the part of Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West about their weak response to the turnout attempt.
There is also dissatisfaction with the prolonged negotiations on the accession of the EU and Putin, which benefit from the situation that Turkey has recovered from the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly obtained additional points in Ankara’s eyes, expressing his support for his elected government after the coup attempt.
Consider that Moscow understands this well, for it itself is deeply ingrained by fear of change in the regime.
The summit, which took place in this narrow coastal castle, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as one analyst called it, the "refugeed alliance", the two countries that feel distant from the West, join forces.
However, despite the unity demonstrated publicly, there are still considerable differences in opinion between the two countries.
The main disagreements concern Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peacekeeper, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations, not wanting to reveal information, both presidents announced at the press conference that they had not discussed this issue.
Turkey's President targetedly avoided issues of disagreement between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to stress them.
There is no clear consensus on how both countries could find a common language on the Syrian issue.
After months, however, the situation has improved as both leaders have at least resumed negotiations.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
The SME brand will continue to play a role in support, announced by the Bank’s Executive Director.
Besides Scotland, SMEs will no longer be available.
Ross Makevans tells the BBC channel in Scotland that the SME brand was associated with bank ambitions globally.
It has rejected these ambitions, as the bank was almost bankrupt eight years ago and needed financial assistance.
In the meantime, experts in the branding strategy have used the SME brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The bank received millions of awards from international sports sponsors, starting with the 6th National Regiment and ending with the Vimbldon tennis champion Andy Murea.
However, it is now decided to place other national brands in the pre-plan.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all the references of SMEs, outside the main office and official stock exchange list, will be replaced by the name of NatWest.
The Ulster Bank is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Now there will also be less private financial brands, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Makevans was interviewed during the trip with clients and employees on Invernessshire.
He told the BBC Scotland channel: "The SKB will become a brand of our investors and with which our employees work, because now we become more of a brand bank."
In time, the bank itself became a global brand and SMEs became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in its industry and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
The SKB has already announced that it will not continue sponsoring the Six Nations and involve various brands in sponsoring sport.
"And it's time to become a brand bank, because we've been asking ourselves a long time ago how to become a better bank for our customers?" says Executive Director.
Three years ago, it would have been very Chinese if we announced that we would become a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
But thanks to heavy work and focusing on the needs of customers, rather than on our own needs, we have evidently made major changes.
We can revive these brands again, so I think now is the right time.
France Detori won 3000, winning first place in New York with horse Predilection
Detori is rewinding champagne by winning its 3000th victory twice in the first race in New York City.
On Friday, Frank Detori won his 3000th victory in the history of Britain, gaining first place in New York City.
He achieved it by winning the second victory in these contests that took place in his hometown, due to the predilection that John Gosdens trained.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth gait that has achieved such results in horse racing.
He joined Ser Gordon Richard, Doug Smith, Lester Pigat, Peter Eder, and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion, Detori, who had won with the horse Gayyar, said, "It's something special."
I'm very confused because my family is here.
I am very happy that this happened in New York, because I have been living here for 30 years.
This is not a big deal, this is not a Royal Askot, but a regular Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After victory, Detori and Predilection are faced with apples and strawberries.
Two jokes have been achieved in these record competitions with obstacles - champion Richard Johnson and career finish 20-time champion Sir Antonius Mackoys, who has installed several records in his career, winning over 4300 wins.
Lester Pigots, a nine-time winner, won 4493 in his career.
France is one of today’s best jokes, and there is no surprise that he has made a success that only rarely can achieve.
He is stylish and powerful, but his tactics make him feel different from the others.
He is a fantastic actor, and for years his enthusiasm and charisma attracts fans of this kind of sport.
A few weeks ago, I told France that he would have won 6,000 if he did not participate only in the end of the week and in the big competitions.
However, it is a real joy that France has been winning regularly for 30 years in the UK competitions.
He is a life - giving man who makes great use of British competitions, and he is an excellent geek.
Franks Detori noted this achievement with his brand - the flying judgment.
From the wind of completion to the flying judgment, Frances Detori has been the face of British horses for 20 years.
This has been a complete journey.
He has won countless great competitions, including the famous "Great Seven" in Askot, and has also experienced a plane crash and disqualification for the use of preparations.
Three years ago, it was difficult for him to return after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated his strength by challenging those who questioned him by returning to his best form.
And he could participate in the competitions for a while - Detori has previously stated that he would like to continue to participate in the competitions for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putins resigns Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putins unexpectedly dismissed Serge Ivanov, head of administration.
Ivanov had been in Putin’s closest circle for many years.
At present, 63-year-old politician has been appointed a special representative on natural and transport matters.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin "has decided to exempt Ivanov from the duties of the head of the Russian President's administration", without mentioning the reason.
In place of Ivanova, Anton Vaino, who has been his deputy since 2012.
The 44-year-old Vaino has been shot by a diplomat.
Vaino was born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, and graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked in the Tokyo Embassy.
As sent to the Kremlin website (in Russian), he later led the management of the President's protocol and government staff.
After being appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
In my view, the main task of the administration is to support your work as the President of the State by drafting laws and controlling the enforcement of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov himself wanted to quit his job and recommended Vaino as his substitute.
Does that make sense?
This step has raped Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov is a sense and close associate of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, has worked in the Security Service of the Council.
He was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At a national television broadcast meeting, both men announced that Ivanov was derogating from the post on his own initiative.
But in spite of the smiles directed at the cameras, which are rarely confirmed by such an explanation, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the outcome of the fight for power?
Nobody knows that.
However, the official claim that a man who was considered a potential president suddenly wanted to become the leader of the Russian environmental policy is perceived with great skepticism.
Ivanov says in his comments published on the Kremlin website to Putin: "It is the fact that at the beginning of 2012 I ask you to entrust me with this difficult job, even to say, a problematic job, for four years.
It turns out I've worked in this office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Former Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former member of the U.S. National Security Service, as well as Putin.
At the end of 1990, Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service, who was the successor of the VDK, and Ivanov took over the post of his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov among the five men he trusted most.
At the end of Putina's second term, Ivanov was considered a potential candidate for the Russian President, as Putina's transfer to the third term would be anti-constitutional.
At that time, however, the president became another close companion of Putin - Dmitrijs Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister, and after three and a half years he returned to the presidency.
The appearance of fish in a garden in Banfas city
A man from Banfa asks for help to find out the circumstances of the fish that appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Beins thinks that 75 fish could be sand dunes who have traveled with the water room.
Mr. Beina, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, published a video on the Periscope website, hoping that someone could know how these five centimeters of large fish came into his garden.
Queenspheric crossing: the bridge is now connected to Faifu.
The projects worth 1.35 billion are currently planned to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern part of the Queensphere crossing and viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Faifu.
The first of the four connecting parts is completed, which means that the bridge construction is close to the end.
The construction of the Faifa bridge is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It consists of 10,000 tons of steel, 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 support cables.
The projects worth 1.35 billion are currently planned to be completed in May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown was on his way to the construction site today and was one of the first to climb the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queensphere Bridge."
In this project we see an incapacitated engineering solution where only more than 30 000 tonnes of cement and steel are used in the construction of this part.
Despite the enormous weight and size of the bridge, the connection of the bridge and viaduct is an extremely delicate process that requires enormous precision.
Overall, more than 79% of the bridge deck is already built and the last phase that will be included with Rositu today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for inclusion.
Director of the Fourth Bridge Connection Project Michael Martins says: "The first link is a very important point in any bridge construction."
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates the highest-class engineering industry.
After the last phase of the road and its connection to the north tower support, we were left to connect the northern road to the part of the ground or viaduct.
This was done by pushing the northern end of the roadway, 700 millimetres south.
It was a huge and at the same time a very delicate operation.
Great, because the route is 222 metres long, weighs about 6000 tonnes and had to be dragged by about 3 %.
The delicacy, because the tolerance in both directions with which the team worked, was only a few millimeters.
Luckily, everything worked out fine.
Simon Bails gets gold in women's rings.
Forget the fight.
Forget the mess.
Simon Bails doesn't worry about it all.
Dynamic flight.
Without effort, he's doing his nails on the blind.
Impossible on the floor.
It's completely innocent.
And finally the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, 19 - year - old U.S.A., a gold medal was awarded by the winner, fully demonstrating the difference between himself and the rest of the world on the Olympic scene.
The total number of her points was 62,198. The head court was too much for the outcome of the silver medal winner and her team member, Alija Raismanes and the Russian sportsman of the bronze medal winner, Alija Mustafinas.
On Thursday, US sportsman Simona Bailsa engaged in a campaign to win Baloch sports for the individual final women in the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bails became the fourth American in a row, winning the title of a multi-racial champion and the fifth best winner, gradually strengthening the reputation as the best winner of his generation and possibly the best winner in history.
When the final result was announced, she burst into tears, for the long journey to this moment was over.
This achievement brings them near impossible athletes such as Michael Felps, who has raised their sport type at another level.
The last three years of Balsa have dominated in its form of sport, winning 15 medals in the world championships, including 10 gold medals, performing so excellent, accurate and ambitious exercises that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lu Retone called her "the best winner she's ever seen".
In Brazil, she was faced with a final test, where she had to face the hopes of her peers rather than other athletes.
She would be disappointed if she returned to her home in Spring, Texas without gold medals.
The US sportsmen Simona Bails (left) and Alija Raismane are being beaten, respectively, after winning the gold and silver medal in the individual finals of the competition for women in the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
The first gold medal was won by Bailsa on Tuesday, making special selection coordinators Martas Karolis adjudicated.
Even though Baals claim that there was no such expectation in their long journey to glory, it is not true.
Part of her performance in the free movement, which included her special acrobatic transition, is accompanied by Latin music, which would perfectly fit on the street next to the arena of the Rio Olympic Games.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl who was adopted by her grandparents when she was still a child and who was discovered by a coach named Eimija Burman on a sports hall where Burmese courts took place, has now become the force to be reckoned with.
She has not lost in the competitions since summer 2013 and victory series can continue as long as Bailsa wants.
Although Mustafin was slightly controlled during the two rotations, it was only illusion.
The balance of the blind and the free movement - part of the game, where Bails will defend his champion title, is still just ahead.
She put herself in front of the score of 15,433 on the balcony and strengthened the leadership of the score of 15.933 in the free movement
Raismane was slowly bitten while waiting for results that were just formality and her tears of joy poured out when a dream that she had once recorded in her notebook was fulfilled.
Raismane’s result was a small activism for four years of old when she shared third place with Mustafin, but lost the fight for the bronze medal.
This time 22-year-old captain of the team, who the Americans call "the old man", took the lead.
After her performance in the free movement, which raised doubts about her return, she was able to devote her time to a blow of air.
In the meantime, 19-year-old Balis's viral Twitter record, which she published this week, is already quite different.
6 years old Mahajs Brown's "crowded in the woods" was shot in Philadelphia.
The police report that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, indicating that he was already the second six-year-old who was shot in Philadelphia this week.
The parents of the child to the CBS Philadelphia news channel confirmed that it was Mahajs Brown.
The elders say that Brown was shot several times, including a circus, a leg, a hand, and a abdomen, but he was still in his mind when he was taken to the hospital.
Her grandmother Delores Melendez told her on television: "She's little body was just in a drawer."
I can't believe it.
The boy has been hospitalized in critical condition and has already undergone several operations.
The family informs him that he will certainly recover.
He had to start his first class at the local primary school.
Brown is one of the four people who were killed in the part of Germany.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
Canal CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, but the other two sufferers are stable.
The canal reports that the child was found in the front seat of the car near 29 years of age in critical condition.
The other two victims were not found in the car, and the police were investigating whether one of them was a burglar.
The investigator informed the CBS Philadelphia channel that several gunmen were most likely involved.
At the site of the event, gun bosses are found, which belong to various weapons.
It seems to have been a long shot.
Found shells on both sides of the entrance.
"So it seems that there have been several armed gunmen here who actively participated in the protest," says Chief of the Philadelphia Police, Antonius Ginaldi.
A number of homes and cars have also been damaged.
No one has been detained yet and it is reported that the police are checking the surveillance camera records.
On Tuesday during the interrogation, a six - year - old girl fell into her arms while playing in front of her home in the Vestouklein area.
She's getting better, but the police are still looking for the guilty.
Why do we need Simon, Gabia, and Laurie?
I call it the Women of the Year for several reasons.
First of all, I've been on all the Summer Olympics since 1984, and the US team has never been so good.
Second, this team has three light bulbs, Simon Bails, Gabia Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who are inspired by many new women of origin.
People may be proud that this team also consists of Alija Raismane, a Jew and Medison Kociana, a Catholic.
Finally, this team really represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
In the last four years, the best farmer is the American of African origin.
Last year, Simona and Gabia took place in 1st and 2nd place.
These are impressive results.
In the previous Olympics, Gabia Douglas became an amazing champion, and America could have been dazzled.
Now, the world has seen incredible exercises performed by three-way World Championships Simon Bails, Douglas and Laurey Hernandez, performing unanticipated, but masterful exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American in a row, winning gold medals for individual women.
His team member Alija Raismane won a silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can do, but the situation in the rest of the country is completely different in working hours.
Simona, Gabia, and Laurie joined the Olympics, as did Alice and Madison.
They are the "Olympic Five" because the next Olympic training team will be only four athletes, and this is the last year of coaching Marta Karola.
In fact, exercise is a precious sport. It is mainly practiced in private lightball clubs, and it is supported by parents who pay for training, rooms, travel, form clothes, hotels (trainers, sportsmen and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these lightweight clubs are located in urban areas that may allow this sport.
In these clubs athletes take all their trainings, and it is a precious and long contribution to light families.
Eimija Būrman - Simona Bail's coach and Maggie Hainia - Lauria Hernandez's coach has trained his athletes since both girls started working with ease.
We need to provide for young girls who are inspired by Simon, Gabia, and Laurie with cheaper exercise opportunities.
I founded my lightweight organisation 20 years ago.
My organization is located in Harlem, and we offer more than 15,000 young people (mainly black and Spanish origins) exercise courses free of charge or at a low price. We have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will discover the branch office in Detroit (in my hometown) to provide local young people with the opportunity to learn about this great sport.
Mildness develops strength, affection and coordination of the body, as well as learns serious work, discipline and reaching the goal.
This combination ensures a long life with good health and success both in school and at work.
This team inspires thousands of new girls to train in light yellow and this is fantastic.
Working with this type of sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thank you Simona, Ali, Gabia and Medison for the great demonstration of the Girl Power, by acquiring the Olympic gold medals and by motivating countless new, diverse girls of origin to become healthy, strong and successful new women.
Following the rejection of the offer by Jeremy Hunt, the young doctors plan to develop more strikes.
The ministers hoped to close the dispute by reaching agreement on changes to the agreement with representatives of the UK Medical Association, but they rejected it by 58 per cent of the 37 000 new doctors who participated in the vote.
In July, Hunts announced plans to conclude a contract indicating that NHS is in a unstable state and that further delays will only harm workers and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed the new contract, which provides for changes in working conditions in the night shifts and in the weekend, in order to improve working conditions in non-standard working hours.
Yesterday BMA's new physician Dr. Elén Makourt announced that the new doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially that it will deepen the labour crisis and that it does not provide for equal conditions for all doctors.
Eight weeks have elapsed until the first group of new doctors sign the new contract, so progress is needed as time has not left much.
The BMA's efforts to solve the problems through negotiations have been hampered by the lack of government involvement and sometimes by full silence.
This happened despite the fact that last month, Jeremy Hunts said that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt must act immediately, stop working and work with the new doctors.
If he doesn't, then the new doctors are ready for new protests.
During the last strike, more than 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed at the end of April, while nurses and consultants tried to replace the patients who had gone to the point.
Ministers hoped to close the dispute by reaching agreement on changes to the agreement with representatives of the UK Medical Association.
BMA wants to raise the rate of work per week for 54 000 new doctors covered by the new contracts.
NHS Employment Executive Director Daniels Mortimer invited new doctors to stay out of strike.
Mr Mortimera explains that the strike does not solve anything, but only increases the pressure on the affected workers and worries, creates stress and delays in patients, caregivers and their families.
In the last two months, we have spoken to the new Committee of Doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, have responded positively to their questions about supervisors and rapporteurs.
Employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues such as the placement of workers, flexible training, in addition to training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, leaving studies and gender pay in medicine, shows that employers, the British Health Education Authority and the Ministry of Health want to make a serious effort to implement agreements concluded with the BME in November, February and May.
It may reduce the risk of heart attack by 2 pounds a day.
Thousands of patients who have had a heart attack may be treated with 2 pounds a day, since the official representatives recommend that they take more people and longer periods of time.
The anti-inflammatory medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart beats in people with heart disease.
This medicine is already prescribed for use 12 months after the heart beat by reducing the risk of repeated heart beats.
NICE, represented by NHS, is recommended to use this medicine 4 years after heart beat to further reduce the risk of heart beats in people with heart and blood vessels problems.
However, NICE under NHS is currently recommended to use this medicine 4 years after heart beat to further reduce the risk of heart and blood vessels.
About 140 000 people live in England each year and in the fourth part of them live in repeated strokes or strokes.
Cardiac and strokes cause the accumulation of fat in the heart walls by forming prosthetics.
If the prophylaxis develops, it can cause a drum by blocking the blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.
However, if the thrombosis is separated from the blood vessels wall, it may go further into the bloodstream and block access to the brain by causing an attack.
People who have had a heart attack have been exposed to a higher risk of a repeated heart attack.
Ticagrelor produced by the UK company AstraZeneca, which is marketed as Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombosis.
The new NICE guidelines published today recommend that people take 90 mg Ticagrelor for 12 months and 3 more years for 60 mg twice daily with aspirin.
NICE Director of Health Technology Professor Kerola Longson explains: "Despite the availability of medications for the prevention of repeated heart beats, more than a quarter of the people who have had a heart stroke experience another heart stroke or stroke, often with severe consequences."
Fear of repeated heartbeat can have a negative effect on the quality of human life.
The evidence suggests that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of repeated heart beats and heart attack in people who have experienced it once.
We are pleased that we can extend treatment opportunities to thousands of people who have thus benefited from Ticagrelor.
Given the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding when taking this medicine for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend taking it for longer than this period.
Culture of political law promotes fraud during elections in Muslim communities
According to the management report, the former mayor of Tauerhamlet, Lutfurs Rahmans, was fired from office in connection with corruption.
The government's report reveals that the culture of the right to political law opens up the eyes to widespread fraud in Muslim communities.
Former Prime Minister Sers Eriks Pickles criticises the police, election guards and city councils that they ignore the signs of fraud in the election process because "is afraid to undermine ethnic and religious interests."
The former secretary of the community, who has now become the head of the anti-corruption organisation, says that the recruitment of voters is so widespread for religious reasons that police should allow guards to be deployed at the polling stations to protect the elected voters.
He also recommends that voters should present a supporting document when they vote to prove their true identity.
At present, voters must only specify the name and address.
He even recommends marking the fingers of the voters who voted in favour with a special ink to prevent a double vote.
The rapporteurs must also ensure greater protection, says Sir Eriks.
He believes that the press should ensure greater access to Council documents and decisions adopted by informal committees and working groups.
He says: "The aim is not only to prevent fraud, but also to protect the local government from more corruption and fraud that goes hand in hand with it."
The report was ordered by Dauningstrita after a scandal in connection with the elections of Tauerhamlet.
Last year, the Court of Special Election decided to remove the city mayor Lutfur Rahman from the city's office due to corruption and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman 's religious view of his Muslim community was "skinned down" by his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman has led his election campaign with guidance that the religious duty of faithful Muslims is to vote for him."
Approximately 300 votes were falsified or questionable because one person had voted several times.
Sir Eriks also points out that there are signs of fraud across the country.
He pointed out that it is particularly disturbing to vote in favour of a post, where the older members of the Muslim community forced others to vote in favour of themselves.
Sir Eriks recommended a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of a document proving the identity of the person.
His report reads: "The evidence shows that members of vulnerable ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, are forced to vote in favour of the community's older elected candidates, particularly in Bangladesh and Pakistan's communities."
"There is concern that the regional authorities do not pay attention to these problems because of the political correctness, as ethnic and religious interests could be affected."
Ms. Eriks made 50 recommendations on improving the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists working with the votes cast by mail to prevent "voting".
The report, which looks at Teresa Meja, also calls for a more thorough registration check to prevent the use of voters' lists in the field of immigration and benefits.
Consider the possibility before the vote of requesting voters to present a document proving the person.
Mark the fingers of the voters who voted in favour with a special ink to prevent a double vote.
To systematically check the nationality of persons to ensure that the person has the right to vote.
Determine three-year limitation requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibition of political campaign participants and activists working with votes cast through postal and electoral envelopes to vote by post.
Ensuring the police's power to order protection at the polling stations.
To amend the law in order to facilitate the call for persons to be held liable for a declaration under the 1983 Human Rights Act.
Prohibition of photographing in the polling districts.
Determine the requirements for the use of only English in the polling districts (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that voters go to the polling stations on a case-by-case basis.
Sir Eriks has been criticizing the Metropolis police for not being aware of the charges in the Tauerhamlet case.
He said: "The court has only disqualified Lufcur Rahman and his representatives for actions related to corruption and fraud."
He was convinced that he was found guilty of a standard of criminal law on the basis of unscrupulous evidence.
He also criticises the "cheques check" of the voters of the inefficient city council in the registration of voters.
Sir Eriks points out: "The court decision taken last year is a alarm call.
Our land is known as the birth of Parliament, but the spread of fraud by disturbing and secret elections and the presence of institutions that fraud does not threaten this good reputation.
Reaction with the rider - Keitas companions and other members of the Olympic Celebrations Rio
In 2016, fans of the Rio Olympic Games were excited about the French rider Pauline Ferrand Prevot, who were recognised by fans as extremely similar to the Cambridge hercogie.
However, the 24 - year - old rider is not the only sportsman who fights this summer for gold, who, as media reports, boasts of his fame.
Therefore, for the honour of the Rio Olympic Games and all the famous faces that are currently visible on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympic players, which are quite similar to the Hollywood stars.
Mentler and Vilka: Member of the US Firearm Team Breidijs Elison, on the left, since childhood compared with Leonardo Di Kaprio
Despite Keita’s roommates on the bike route, many people on the Internet point out that this pilot could be the superstar of Leonardo Di Kaprio’s twin brother.
A member of the U.S. male shooting team, Breidy Elisons caused a windshield when photographs were published, where he was very similar to Volstrit Vilka.
The sportsman himself noticed the wind in social media and recognized that he had been compared to Leonardo Di Kaprio since he was a child.
"I personally don't see a big similarity except for the bar," Breidy tells Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome man, so I think he's a compliment."
This year, even more popularity will undoubtedly be one of the most popular pairs of London Olympics players: a devastating similarity between British Telephony Greg Ruterford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian light-headed Aliya Mustafin is compared with Gloria Estefan, the American singer of Cuban origin, thanks to her large, expressive eyes.
Speaking of swimming, the South African swimmer Camerons van der Burgs has been compared for several years to the "Raditi View" star Metju Morrison.
Changes: This user has noticed that Nathan is an "Inception" actor’s version of the film.
Also, the old companions are tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnet, who have similar bites and lips.
Russian silver medalist, swimmer Julia Efimova and actress Annaline Maccorda can boast not only of the skin and blonde hair that are exposed to the sun. Meanwhile, fans believe that the athletic American sportsman Nathan Adrians is like Joseph Gordon Levit.
Poor women: The football star (left) Hopai Solo and the serial "Deksters" actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) is similar to the face and eyes.
Not one: a Twitter user was pleasantly surprised to learn that others also see these similarities
Theory: This user believes that there may be a reason why both seem so similar
Recently, a Twitter user with genuine pleasure announced that "the other internet users agree that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter actually look identical."
The U.S. football star and the series "Deksters" actress are so very similar to the shape of the face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons relate to Carrie Volš Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to Laura Linen's smile. Also, the light gold medalist Gabi Douglas boasts a beautiful, wide smile that resembles the "Bring It On" starring Gabriel's Union smile.
The CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for his comment that the Chinese swimmer was 'quited as a pig'.
Bairona Makdonalda's analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhas finish 4x200 m free-style in a women's stadium, called for comfort in CBC viewers.
Canada's CBC channel was forced to apologize, as one of its commentators commented that 14 years old Chinese swimmer from the competitions had "extricted from the competitions that he smiled alone" and "ended as a pig".
Commentary Bairon Macdonalds thought that his microphone was off when 4x200 m free-style staphyte women finally expressed their personal opinion.
Macdonald, who was included in the CBC's commentary team to give comments on life, said, "This little 14-year-old from China is unable to stay with her."
"Before she fell asleep, she fled from the competitions, that she smiled alone and ended up like a pig."
Thank you so much.
The result of the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhanan in the second phase was 1:57.79, which is 1.61 seconds slower than the result of the Canadian Telores Ruck, allowing Canadians to reach China.
Viewers throughout Canada responded immediately on the Internet because they were shocked to hear such sounds and statements.
Emets Makfarlains tweeted: "Did the CBC's direct comment just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "ends like a pig"??"?.
Idiots don't understand that they were still in the straight attic.
Ai Yanha from China 4x200m free-style final women were called "a small 14-year-old from China who doesn't belong."
Criticism against the Baron Macdonald quickly came into force, as many asked for explanations.
Twitter users were unable to trust when listening to Barion Macdonalda's insensitive comments.
Twitter user Sarah Paradi wrote: "Oh, #ByronMacDonald.
You're a representative of CBC and Canada and because of you, we're all going to be racist.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was currently conducting the CBC live radio, apologized for Macdonald's comments, saying, "We apologize for the comment on the result of the swimming in the straight ether."
It was a bad choice of words, and we are very sorry that it happened.
CBC apologized for more than 90 people who had responded to this comment on Twitter.
McDonald's colleague Scott Russell came to apologize for his place.
Then CBC collected an apology for more than 90 Twitter users who complained about Macdonald's comment.
The channel also quickly published an apology and a statement.
We are very sorry that such comments have been made and they have come to the right place.
Yesterday we immediately responded and apologized to all viewers and followers of social media.
In the interests of clarity, it must be said that Bairon’s comments were made about the performance of the swimmer, not addressed to her personally.
However, in any case, they were unprofessional and failed to choose the words and Bairon was very sorry for what happened.
On Thursday afternoon, Macdonald personally apologized to the direct victim and tried to explain that he did not think that his comment would be perceived as a personal attack.
He said, "I would like to use the moment and apologise for the comment I made yesterday after women's free-style competitions."
I'm talking about the swimmer's performance, not his personal performance.
To say that I didn’t mean to show disrespect, I’m really sorry that it happened.
Primmark’s buyers are shocked by a woman who has an unsanitary attitude in the basement store.
The buyers felt uncomfortable when the woman began to dress in order to fit in the middle of the store.
Even worse, she took them to make sure that they were present and then pulled them back into the store.
She continued looking for clothes at the Folkestone Bouverie Place Trade Centre store and took four more cookies.
Primark shop Bouverie Place in the shopping center of Folkeston – the place where this woman held the basement and then put it back in the hair.
There were also two children in the store, Jania Davidson, who said that an unknown woman, after being placed in the basement, wore her clothes and left the store without buying anything.
She points out that humans were unable to trust their eyes.
Standing in the middle of the store, she took off her hair underpants, pulled off her rabbits and bikes, and measured them on the spot.
She did not even try to find a more discreet place where to measure them, but she simply kept them in place.
Everyone looked at her shirts and apparently didn’t care, for she simply put them back in her hair.
She measured three more cookies, until she decided that she did not like any of them and left the store.
He did not think that he would be attracted to someone who looked at him or that he would give advice about someone who would buy the clothes he was wearing.
Davidson's novelist (33 years) from Kent says: "It is a good idea that someone will buy clothes that have been accepted by another person and that are not then emptied."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson's novelist adds: "I accept that after leaving the shop staff removed those clothes from the shop's hair - which is also acceptable."
I cannot imagine that I could buy a new basement and find out that another woman has kept it and then it is not empty.
The representative of Primark pointed out that Primark was aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August.
The specific clothes are removed from the store’s hair.
How to Protect Yourself From Firearms by using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
In order to find out how to protect ourselves in a close distance from the firefighters, we talked to the Major of Krav Maga from New York Ron Mizraki.
Whether you're hit from the front or the back, this video shows how to protect yourself and get the upper arm over the lift.
Misraki points out that if the attacker attacks from the back, it must first turn to clearly see the attacker and avoid such a trajectory.
Then the weapon must be held between his front hand and his shoulder and made a seat on the opponent's face with his free eels.
Then follow the site along the road through the circus and as long as the attacker gets stuck in pain, he must take off his weapon, go on face with the gun and step away, continue to turn his weapon against him.
If the attacker is approaching from the front, the situation is similar - it must be avoided from any such trajectory, the weapon must be restrained and replaced so that the wicked cannot be shot.
At the same time, pressure must be put on the weapon and a sitter must be put on the chest and finally remove the weapon and refrain from continuing to rely on it.
Does it sound complicated?
Watch the video to see how Misraki does it.
But remember, if you're not Krav Maga master, then it's safer to return your money to the farmer.
The family is demolishing the social home of Saltash Kornvola and is on the street.
The water family has left the neighborhood for the terror of the neighbors, causing damage to the social home to the size of 50,000 martyrs.
Tanja Skeldona and her partner Sean Trebilkok just left the property in Saltaš Kornvol, as several complaints were made about them.
When they were forced out of the property, the shocked housekeepers found that the property was completely demolished.
There were holes in the floors and walls, waste was washed everywhere, and walls were covered with graphite.
The family is now out of the property and is likely to live in a private property.
The manager of the Cornvolt Housing Service, Donna Makevoj, says that there are concerns that housing will not be possible to restore.
She says that the people who lived here were extremely difficult and she feels that people can’t live there.
In this case, a number of factors need to be assessed, as this property in Cornvolu will no longer have a good reputation.
This family is famous and their name is well - known.
The couple had three sons who were periodically held in possession, and the police said that their terror was expressed as violence, exaggeration on the streets with baseball bats, induction of locals, use of drugs, sale of drugs, and sound abuse and laziness.
In June, 47 - year - old Skoldton was convicted of antisocial behaviour.
In several demolished rooms the waste was found.
In a house where drugs may be marketed in advance, a number of floors have also been thrown out.
Neighbors say they've been on the street regularly and kept calling the police.
The Cornvola Housekeeping Service put them out of the tight grip of property when they were given 11 weeks to get out of the house voluntarily.
Those who had lost their neighbors were very happy to be released because their lives were absolute.
One said, "They didn't care about other people."
We lived with them for 20 years, it's always been crazy.
I can't believe how often we've seen the police here.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because there was so quiet here - we haven't been there!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be wonderful here.
Adam Fitzpatrick, who is the Chief of the Family Protection of the Kornvol Housekeeping Service, said that the family did not cooperate with the local security authorities.
The family lived here for 20 years and was regularly called the police.
In the grown-up garden, various old and unusable items were found.
He also said, "It is very sad that the tenants have not shown any responsibility for their behavior, because leaving the house is always the last step that the Cornvola Housekeeper considers."
This was a very difficult case because their behavior was extreme and their neighbors were very hard to see in their behavior.
I appreciate the work that all my team, Devona and Cornvola police and members of the community have contributed to this matter, who were courageous and cooperated with us in providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will ease the lives of our neighbours and show that anti-social behaviour is unacceptable.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived here for different periods of time, but all were about 20 years old.
A clean mattress, which remained on the floor in one of the rooms after leaving.
Staff will now have to clean up the waste left at home.
In 2014, the police house was cut down and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, weights, accessories and 1700 pounds in cash.
Skedton was only considered to be responsible for the storage of Class B drugs with a view to their distribution.
She said that the money was intended for her son Lee Sheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After leaving, it is known that they are now renting some private property in Plimut.
On many walls there were graphs.
Police report that they will continue to expel tenants who violate their rental contracts.
The police representative of Devona and Cornvola, Angela Krova, points out that this outbreak is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
She also said, "This is a warning to those who believe that they can act like they want and that there will be no consequences."
Devona and the Crown police are not acceptable criminal and anti-social behaviour, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect the local communities.
The willingness to spend can give impetus to the economy.

The cannibal mermaids ban burkini swim costumes in the beaches.
The mayor of the southern French town of Kannu has forbidden wearing burkini swimwear in this city’s beaches, which is almost completely covered by women’s body and is very memorable in hydro-tourism, local officials announced on Thursday.
Kannu Mayor David Linars has signed an order that "access to beaches and swimming is prohibited to anyone who does not have a swimwear that respects good habits and secularism" as the basic principle of the French Republic.
"Pludmala's clothing, which outwardly shows religious affiliation, when France and the places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks, can create the risk of public order disturbances (distortion, clashes, etc.) that need to be avoided," the order said.
"We are talking, not about the prohibition of religious symbols in the beach, but about outer clothing related to the trust movements of terrorists who fight us," explained the head of the municipal municipal services in Tjeri Miguels.
He added that burkini swim costumes in Kannu beaches have not been seen since 28 July, when the good members of the central party "Republicans" Linārs signed this order and it came into force.
This week, in the city of Marseille, the Aquapark recalled a planned private Muslim event for women who would wear burkini in swimwear, as the awareness of such an event was expressed by both the good and the left-wing politicians.
In France it is prohibited to wear masks of Muslim women’s heads, but no religious symbols or appropriate clothing are prohibited.
On 14 July, 85 people were killed in a terrorist attack in the nearby town of Nicaea, about which the group was held responsible.
On 26 July, two rebels, who had vowed allegiance to the State of Islam, brutally blinded priests in the church in the north west of France.

The management report states that last year the company rebuilt the store in Riga, Sloka Street, and closed the store in Riga, in the Kurzeme prospectus.
This year, like other years, the company's main task is to continue to increase both turnover and profit.
In the meantime, it is recommended to leave the profits alone.
"Jishk" is an international shop network that offers goods for home repair.
Jisch Linnen'n Furniture was founded in 2001.
The company’s core capital is EUR 3500 264.

The "Cubane" festival started in Lucavsala.
Thursday, August 11th, the evening of Lucavsal was given a start to one of the last of this summer's festivals - there will be "Cubane" until Sunday night.
The first evening meetings were held by groups such as Enter Shikari from Great Britain, who were expected to be a long time ago, but the program did not disappear, American benches "NOFX", DJ Maxim from the group "The Prodigy" and others.
The following days of the festival also feature the words of appreciation - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", the founder of the Pancroque legend "Ramones" by Marky Ramones with "Marky Ramone's Blitzkryeg", "Brutto&Lyapis" by the white-bred pancroque leaders of Sergei Mikaloku, the popular Georgian actor and singer Wahtangs Kikabidze, the Ukrainians "Vopli Vidoplyasova" and a number of others, but the full programme of action can be considered here.
This is the second year of the Kubana festival in Latvia.
Earlier it suffered financial failure and huge losses, but it did not hold the organizers back from the repeated attempt - they added a name to the stamp, also included a group of Latvians (on Friday evening 19:15 at the stage of the scene "All Day Long") and announced that now the festival had become "closer and gained a local color with such Riga symbols as its panorama and cats".
Whether these efforts will be justified, yet to be resolved, because the festival just collapsed, but, as Delfi Entertainment observed in the first evening, at least the temporary enormous efforts of people did not succeed and the number of visitors was similar.
The British team rides twice the Olympic record and wins the race.
The British team's third team repaired the Olympic record twice on Thursday and won the race for men.
The first Olympic records were corrected by the British, but in the first place the competition was re-corrected by the New Zealanders.

The UK final team won 42,440 seconds, overcoming the new greens by 0.102 seconds.
In the fight for bronze, the French team was able to overcome Australia.
It should be noted that the record has also been corrected in the qualification of women's recruitment - the British team has corrected the world record, which is now 4:13,260.
The President who remained in the shadow: Gustav Zemgal - 145.
On Friday, 12 August, 145 years passed, since the birth of the second President of Latvia Gustav Zemgals.
The state of Latvia was declared by Landgal, but the undeclared remains largely described by the first president of Latvia, John Chakste, and the last president of the previous period in the Ulmana shadow.
None of our fellow citizens has defended democracy and justice as much as Zemgal, in the book dedicated to Gustav Zemgal, published ten years ago by Arnold Aužiņš.
In the interview with the Delfi portal, Auishins stresses that the Earth is one of the rare high-ranking politicians who have had a sense of humor.
The rest are stiff, always very correct.
He taught not to be such, but it could be similar today to that of Raymond Vianius.
"He was one who is close to the people," says Auzihs.
Today’s politicians have a bad history, they have referred to Karli Ulman as good leaders, but rarely anyone knows how negative he was.
The only person in the government to whom he is not in a position of authority was General Balody.
Even if he is kind and funny in the picture, he was histories of nature.
"The earth, with its sense of humor and democracy, leaves the opposite impression," Auzihs says.
Professor Aivars Stranga of the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia agrees with Delfi's assessment of Zemgal as a peaceful and valued national.
He also notes that Zemgals has shown respect for minorities and has regularly invited Jewish representatives to the President's palace.
"At that time it was not an act, after the Zemgal Presidency Alberts Kwiess took over this tradition," the historian tells.
He was such a quiet and distinguished man who had long to speak as president.
He didn't think about it himself, he just didn't want fame.
He also considered himself rather critical because he did not know the French language, but felt that the President must understand it.
"During the presidency, the French language was based on both learning and learning," explains Stranga.
The earth did not allow itself to be re-elected, and he did not have a very high position.
In any case, he is a very respected person in Latvia's history, and he was in a serious position before the President's palace - he was a very demanding notary.
Zemgal also led the famous Zemgalkas in Suvorova Street 3, where there was a stockholders' and stockholders' company, in which practically government negotiations became a state of Latvia.
He was always progressive.
He was not a great honorer of Ulmana, but he was not opposed in public.
"In the private negotiations, however, it has sometimes been said that the real actions of Ulmana are not sympathetic to him," says Stranga.
He lived a peaceful life, no doubt about immorality or corruption.
How is Zemgal remembered today?
Unfortunately, for the most part, he is associated only with some street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, thought to be central.
"There were no major disturbances in his time, i.e. he could associate with such a real stable Presidency," Stranga concludes.
During the Presidency of Gustav Zemgal, from 1927 to 1930, a visit to Latvia took place in Sweden, which at the time indirectly meant full recognition in the neighbouring country and inclusion in the family of the democratic nations of Northern Europe.
On 28 May 1929, Zemgals visited Stockholm.
A visit to the reply of King Gustav V of Sweden took place in Latvia on 29 June 1929.
The second president of Latvia was born in 1871, but left forever in January 1939.
A simple way to help a child deal with anger attacks.
I often come face - to - face with the fact that the anger of the child, the lack of a child, is viewed by the parents as something wrong and abnormal.
When the child manifests his anger openly - we don't know how to react, "Econet" says psychologist Jekaterina Kesa.
The expert encourages small negotiations on these natural and human feelings - anger and rage, which each experiences periodically.
Aggression - it is already the physical action addressed to other people, and it usually appears when we feel angry.
When we are adults, we are angry, upset - we usually know what is happening to us and how to deal with it.
We can express, suppress, hide, keep, tell about it to our friends or other relatives, we can be angry to sell a divan, smoke cigarettes (it's not the best way to get rid of anger!), go in the shower, sit on the table and do other things that we don't usually do.
We don't turn our aggression against others, because we know different ways to deal with these emotions.
Children, when angry, do not understand what happens to them, how to name them, and how to live with them.
They can say, "Come away!", you're a fool, "Dad Mom," "I don't care about you," "I'm not going to threaten you" - and very rarely when you can say, "I'm mad at you."
Children live literally, they are completely here, at this moment, they are spontaneous and truly in expressing their feelings, and they are often in the embrace of different emotions.
It is very important that parents do not prevent their children from expressing their feelings, including anger, not being alarmed about it, but, on the contrary, helping the child.
Should relationships be interrupted?
A long working day where everything has not always happened as you would like, or simply a bad attitude - there are so many reasons why you would want to be at the moment, day or even longer "unlock" from all over the world.
Is it possible to express your relationship at the moment and to get a little excited?
However, does it show that each of the partners is on their way?
In his opinion, the honourable Members are divided into different ages.
John (23) is short and nuclear: "In my view, if relations are necessary, then you are not with the real person."
Edward (30) has also discovered a scheme that may help.
If you feel that your partner starts to feel nervous about every detail, then it's definitely the right time to look at other fields of hunting to see if you miss her, or especially about her not thinking about her or even not wanting to see her again.
So the answer is - yes, delaying a break can help save time and understand how important the other side is to you.
Caspar (29) reveals his theory.
In my view, relations must be maintained on the other hand, because if you spend 24 hours a day with a person, seven days a week, the disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the sight of every detail that the other person does, and it begins to fall on the nerves.
People start to hug each other, especially if you don't talk about anything anymore, just about what you did day by day.
My personal experience makes me think so, so I have not had a relationship for more than a few months.
If you think for a moment that someone else or someone else is better - then why did this woman, with whom you have earned a fortune, who can think that there is not good enough and there is a paradise field behind the mountains?
Thinking is already a minor offense.
If it's not, then it's not.
"I am, therefore, a little condemn those who are not." says Edmund (46).
Karlim (33) is a completely contradictory view.
I think everyone needs a moment to stay.
You can't look at each other every moment, all the time, from morning to evening, looking at each other and staring at the love that's insatiable.
Attopies!
There are so many things - friends, jobs, ballets.
It's all my time.
Of course, whether a Christian wife or a congregation, however, if both of us understand how to maintain a balance between family life and the rest of the world, it can even survive to the end of the grave.
That's it.
March (27) says it: "It is difficult to say - whether it is necessary or not, it may or may not take a break, but one is clear - to its proposer there is nothing in relation to the end, something lacking."
If this question arises, then it must be calculated that there will be some change in the near future - on the right side or on the wrong side, it depends on itself.
I think as long as you're young and busy, as long as you're busy - something all the time, but when everything remains serious and the relationship goes into a completely different phase, there can be no talking about rest.
But you have decided to spend all your life together!
"If you can't deal with one another now and once in a while need a room, then there will be when you will be pensioners who comment on how long-lasting cats die or argue about where the day the garden needs to be better planted," explains Christap (19).
All the words of the Lord have been changed.
With his exciting and exciting personality, Rosental was the first to stimulate the interest of the Latvian people in visual arts.
"In this sense he was the first love of the Latvian people, which as such will remain unforgettable forever," wrote Roman Suta about Latvian art teacher Jani Rozental.
Also, in 2016, when opening the old teacher's wide retrospective exhibition in the main building of the Latvian National Museum of Art, it is clear - Rosentāls is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but from 13 August it is available to visitors and will be open until 30 October.
The Latvian National Museum of Art with a wide retrospection in the newly opened Grand Exhibition Hall of Year painter Jani Rozental (1866-1916), which is part of UNESCO's 50th birthday celebration calendar.

The U.S. model business backgrounds in his interpretation acquired the perversion of a refined photosession gloss and the impatience of the horror film.
In fact, it is very challenging to balance the work of art-house film and the Hollywood genre product, which is difficult to achieve.
The film with Vigo Mortensen focuses on the question of whether the parents' conceptually chosen life models (environmental, vegetarian, alternative and exclusion from the stupidity and values of the consumer society) bring blessings or destructiveness to their children.
The idealist father of six children after the death of his wife is confronted with questions about the correctness and true values of the elections.

The solo number of this survival can be compared to James Franco's performance in a 127-hour film and the Rayen Kingdomlds game in a film Description alive.
Perhaps there is also the main role of the artist, Mila Kunisa, whose revalues from the model memory of the creative survivors and family values of the twins seem only to be created for the entire fantasy of Hollywood writers.
The Islamic state has captured 2,000 civilians in Syria.
The Islamic national fighters of the terrorist group, fleeing Menbija, Syrian Aleppo province, were captured by approximately 2,000 civilians, who were used as a living force, by US-supported Kurds and Arab alliances and observers on Friday.
"We killed them because they took civilians with them when they fled to Jerabulus," said Kurdu Menbija military press representative.
After a two-month battle, the Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD) who are supported by the US Kurdish-Arab Alliance in northern Syria announced on Friday that Menbija has been released from the jihadist.
The Islamic State of Menbiz accepted in 2014.
Last week, the QSD raised most of the "Islamic State" fighters from Menbija, but some maintained and displayed their own resistance.
On Friday, however, they left the city, taking the gain with them.
Islamists go to Jerábulus, which is on the Turkish border.
Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) also reported that "Islamic State" has taken about 2,000 people.
SOHR reported that the Islamics had taken the cars of the city's inhabitants, forced people to collapse them, and then taken them to Jerábulus.
Islamic national fighters have also committed mass kidnappings.
In January, Islamists plundered more than 400 civilians, including women and children, in the province of Deir ez Zoras in eastern Syria.
Later, Islamists released some 270 from their ranks.
How many Islamist fighters have fled from Menbija, is not known.
The Kurdish military council press representative Menbija reported that the QSD had managed to rescue 2,500 people who had been captured by Islamists in Menbiz.
The information collected by SOHR shows that at least 437 civilians, including 105 children, have lost their lives in the Menbish struggle.

Kolegova refuses to apply to the VID driver's office.
Inga Kolīgova, Head of the National Environment Service, decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of Director-General of the National Revenue Service (VID), the agency LETA informed the Ministry of Finance.
Koljegova points out that the consultation of her candidacy has increased between the ruling coalition parties.
It seems that the real reasons for the discussions are related to the visible but more frequent, invisible interests and they have nothing to do with the assessment of my professional capacity.
"It is also unacceptable to me," he said, "that I have already been the applicant for the role of the head of the VID.
In the event that her candidacy was confirmed by the Government, it would be clear that it would not be a convincing vote and would not allow the necessary changes to the IIDs to be fully worked and implemented, with all government support.
Without it, full - time work would not be possible, Kolígova concludes.
"Sometimes I have publicly stressed that I do not want to be politically dependent, but at the moment all my candidacy process is too politicized," explains the official.
"Thanks for the confidence and support I have shown, it is the experience I value as a benefit," Reizniecei-Ozolai wrote.
The unit said on Wednesday that during the meeting with Kolígovu there were "essential contradictions" between the explanations of the candidate and the information available in the public registers about the costs of dividends by SIA Paloggs, as the decisions of the Palogg meetings of participants are publicly available to avoid profit sharing.
At present, the Head of the VID is Deputy Director-General Dace Pelēk.

The police immediately informed the court, which will also decide on the child’s next fate.
The Riga Free Office has introduced all the recommendations of the UK regarding the Russian island project.
The Riga Free Port Administration has implemented all of the five recommendations of State Control (SMO) regarding the development of the project Infrastructure for the transfer of port activities from the city centre, Dina.lv informed the company.
The approval of the project is planned at the next meeting of the Riga Free House.
In order to implement the recommendations in accordance with the opinion of the VC in preparing the documentation necessary for the implementation of the recommendations, the Riga Free Office also followed the conclusions of the legal and operational audit conducted by the International Auditor Deloitte Riga Free Court and the recommendations made to improve project management at the next stage of the project.
Information on the implementation of recommendations has also been sent to the UK today.
In spite of the fact that the Riga Free Court administration does not agree with the opinion prepared by the UK on the usefulness of the Russian island project, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and the European Commission (EC) funding provider.
I would like to stress that all the planned works within the project have been completed in full within the specified time limits and in the planned amount.
"In order to prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the UK, as well as the Stiftors that the main objective of the free movement is to successfully implement the project, we have put in place all the recommendations of the UK on project management and monitoring issues," says the head of the project of the Russian island, Sanita Kaire.
The long-term action plan for the control and monitoring of the project's objective was complemented by the main planned actions of the stakeholders and the necessary decision-making deadlines, the definitions of meetings and regular reporting and their deadlines, the tools for monitoring the planned construction process, as well as the most important definitions of the border points.
The approved action plan to achieve the project's objective by 31 December 2018, in line with the recommendations of the UK, has been complemented by the implementation monitoring activities, thus strengthening the control of the time-limits for the activities of other parties involved in the implementation of the project on the part of the Riga Free Court of Justice.
A project management plan has been redesigned to improve the management of the project and to reduce potential risks, defining the areas of management of the project and specifying the documents that provide the control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
To enhance the project capacity, a project management framework has been developed which reflects the structure, qualifications and functions of the project management team of the planned project.
In order to improve the communication between Riga Free Port administration and the parties involved in the project, a communication plan has been developed by the stakeholders in the project, which, in addition to the parties set out in the project action plan, defines the principles, types and periodicity of the project for successful completion of the project by the parties concerned.
In order to improve the control of the use of funds, however, the need for the conclusion of the service contract or the start of the procurement contract and the rule of law will need to be further detailed.
Within the framework of the project, the Russian island has built a global port infrastructure – four new deep-water docks, railways and engineering communications.
The co-financed buildings of the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into operation at the end of the year already spent, with a savings of EUR 10.6 million.

Slovakia is the EU Presidency by January.
German researchers discuss the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to a new study, the number of people who died at the Communists ’ former Eastern border could be much higher than previously considered, but doubts about the true number of victims have not yet been raised.
According to data released on Wednesday, the Berlin Wall Museum Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989, at the border with the Western associated areas and later the West Communist authorities, has blinded 1841 people who have tried to get out of their controlled territory.
The museum has been investigating border-related deaths for years and is constantly adjusting the number of victims.
This year, another 11 deaths have been added to the list, including among the victims including a six-year-old boy who is dying trying to reach the family through the current Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are the Soviet army deserters.
"The valid amount of damage caused by the double evil of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," says museum director Alexander Hildebrande.
"Our task is to ensure that the sheds of the people who died in an attempt to escape from the Communist-controlled state are spared and lost," stressed in Hildebrande's distributed statement.
However, other researchers have already questioned new figures.
In an interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung, "Skaitlis 1841 is unconfirmable", said Berlin Free University of Eastern History expert Johannes Statts.
He and other researchers at the Free University of Berlin are currently reviewing possible suspected deaths at the border, and so far only 260 cases have been approved.
In the past, researchers estimated that only 138 people were killed at the Berlin Wall.
In view of those people who have died, trying to escape the Baltic Sea or to enter the West through the neighbouring territory, the number of victims could be estimated by the State to be about a thousand.
However, it is much less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the different number of victims could be different methodologies.
Checkpoint Charlie Museum also records all cases of suicide of Eastern border guards regardless of whether they were directly related to their service.
The museum also records deaths that are not related to direct violence.
"If seniors aged 70 to 80 years after contact with the border control mira from the heart strike, it must be considered as the consequences of this "miracle" border, Hildebrande.
However, the State is convinced that there is a need for a distinction between the old people who may have died as a result of the injury they have experienced and those whose death has resulted in a long wait on the hot bus at the border.
Regardless of its victims' record, it is not easy, as the Communist Eastern authorities have not collected such statistics, and researchers have to select documents from different archives, the State states.
However, the State group has recently produced new documents, and therefore it could come up with a new number of victims in the near future.
LPF President Pone went to Rio with coach accreditation; this is a surprise.
In the last few days, the President of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF) has come with coach accreditation in the Olympic Games Kaspars Pone Riodezaneiro.
On Wednesday, extensive axioms were caused by the words of the Olympic swimmer Alona Ribakov, German Jakubovska, who discovered that at the last moment in Rio de Janeiro, they decided to go to Pone while the coach had to stay home.
The list of drivers initially approved the swimmers Alona Ribakova and Uvis Kalniņš, coach Jakubovskis and Devis Kolins, as well as the president of the Federation, Pone.
The Latvian Swimming Federation applied five participants to the Olympics, and Aldon Vrublävskis claimed that Germany will be and will be looking for tickets before departure.
"However, apparently for an objective reason, he was not," said Mr, expressing the view that this did not affect the outcome of Ribakov.
At the request of the federation, the Uvja coach agreed to help her.
Mr, who is a member of the LOC Executive Committee, I would like to criticise the LOC's activities by blaming the Olympic Sports Supervisory Organization.
In my view, it is not ethical for the LOC Executive Committee to approve five persons and not bring any of them out.
"I don't know why not enough seats for the swimming federation," Mr. Pone said that the work of the federation and their presidents has not been evaluated in society, reminding us that the presidents of the federation are not getting wages.
He also criticised Jakubovski himself, saying that before the London Olympics, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he complained to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and invited Latvia not to send any athletes.
However, he could not tell why he was in the Olympics with a coach's accreditation, which probably had to come to Jakubovski.
"I was applied as the president of the federation ("team leader"), but for unknown reasons, I received coach accreditation and now I'm nowhere inside."
The situation changed every day, the number of accreditations available changed.
Until the last moment, I thought that German would be, because I had no other information.
According to the information available to the agency LETA, a few days before Ribakova started, she had an eye-to-eye conversation with Poni and after her swimmer had had tears in her eyes, but the president of the LPF himself said it had a daily conversation with the desire to start sportsmen before the start.
He recalled that the LPF oversees five sport types in the Olympic programme, and four of them are also training children in Latvia.
The president of the federation said that it is also very important in Latvia that he has talked about such programmes and that he has been in Rio de Janeiro for almost two weeks.
He celebrated the Federation's work and said that the World Cup could be held in Latvia in 2018.
Location Riodežaneiro is not my holiday, here I work, spend my time and try to implement four-quarters programmes.
There will be 600,000 salmon.
The AS Latvenergo fish resources renewal programme is taking place in Daugav in Mangalsala this week, with more than 600,000 single-year-old salmon and tima that have been grown in the fish farms of Bior Tomes and Doles by the scientific institute.
Latvenergo agency LETA informed that the introduction of fish will continue in the coming months - every year, 6 300 000 different species of small fish and caps are being introduced in the Daugavas basin.
In the spring and early summer of 2016 will be released in June - sigha, July - spring salmon, August and September - sandarti and vimbas.
The director of Latvenergo's production, Māris Kunjickis, said that care for the environment is one of the cornerstones of the sustainable development of the Latvenergo Group.
"In measures to protect and propagate fish resources, any action is aimed at environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, both for the production and introduction of small fish in the Daugavas basin and for other activities," said Kunjickis.
This year, more than 600,000 uniform salmon and tima will be released in the Daugavas game.
For the second year before the injection, small fish are marked by the cutting of the fat.
The cargo in question today contains 25 000 small salmon with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Each year, in scientificly justified species and in numerical quantities in Daugava and its pools, there is the introduction of small fish and caps.
The increase in fish resources in Daugav and its basin waters shall be carried out by Bior in accordance with the regulatory acts on the basis of the expertise of the economic activity of Latvenergo on the basis of the loss of fish resources and the conclusion of the compensatory measures to ensure the diversity of fish resources.
On the other hand, on the basis of that expertise, the State Environment Service shall decide on the amount and type of compensation.
The annual amount of compensation for Latvenergo in the fisheries resource renewal programme is EUR 1,035 000.
In the spring of 2016 Latvenergo, in cooperation with the company "We Fish" the fifth year, locates 400 artificial fish nils in Daugava near the city of Kaibala and Ikškýiles.
Cooperation with the company through the promotion of the natural nerd of fish is also supported by Latvenergo in addition to an initiative to revitalise fish resources.
The placement of the artificial nests in the reservoir is an important measure that contributes to the protection and reproduction of fish resources in Daugav.
The festival "Sansus concert hall" is a park, forest, circus.
Guli in the tent, eat as a restaurant, walk in the cages and listen to the researched chamber music, enjoying the quiet nature of peace, - such a combination offers an alternative chamber music festival in Sansus, which is already invited to the Aknieste municipality on the third summer.
The festival will take place in Sussai - no longer an existing village - in the former parish courtyard, next to forests and circuses.
In three days - from 12 to 14 August - five views of carefree natural and academic music can be combined.
The theatre and contemporary circus, performances and installations are located here.
Opera and academic music, especially in its latest expressions, finds new audiences in a free and open environment without the stiffness of concert halls.
The distance from here to Riga is about 150 km, but to the smiling wall and the ease of walking just a few minutes.
"Please do not look for a program, because we have deliberately chosen not to publish it before, so that people do not go to one particular event or artist, because the real taste in Sansui can only be absorbed by spending all three days in it," invites the festival promoter and host, operabaritone Armands Silīņš.
The festival doors are open Friday at 17.00, and the first concert is at 19.00.
Of course, there will be programmes on the spot with all the information.
For those who have to choose one day, we recommend Saturday because it is the most polluted - from 9 a.m. to the next morning.
"The names of the artists are available on the website www.sansusi.lv", says Armands Silihn.
The bouquet of artists includes, for example, the violinist Eva Bindere, the poet Kristíne Blaumane, the opera star Inga Kalna, the clarinetist Guntis Kuzma, the trumpeter Janis Porietis, the pianist Reinis Zariņis, the quartets of Quadra and RIX and even the Estonian air acrobat Grete Gross, who together with Latvian musicians Eric Kirshfeld, Martin Zilbert and the actress Anci Strazdu have created a contemporary circus performance for the artist's internal struggle.
Specially, the festival has also become a novelty.
In the exhibition for children "Kukuanis", composed by Olija Kozlovska and Jäkabs Nimanis, after F. Kafka's story, the entomologist (supply researcher) will participate with Armand Siliņš, musicians and actors, Ugis Peteran.
Oscar Herliņš has won the first Stig Quartet, while Anna Čirse - Wood opera, performance, whose main heroes in Andra Kalnozola mode with Katrina Neiburg's video projections and Andra Egliš's script will be in three small puduaries in the wide area of three hectares.
Singing in the voices of Laimas Ice, Dinaras Rudánes and Zigmar Graš, they will come in romantic relations, just like the science of the lighting age of Swedish natural scientist Kārļa Linnė in the study of the Woods of the Woods (1729).
Riodezaneiro Olympics today begins one of the greatest hopes of the Latvian delegation, sportsman Laura Ikauniece-Admidinias.
Ikauniece-Admidinas at 15.35 a.m. after Latvia's time will start the game in 100 meters of barriers, but at 16.50 a.m. waiting for the race to be held.

Seventy-sex competitions will be closed on Saturday when the distance, the cutting and the 800-metre race takes place.
Prior to the Olympics, Ikauniece-Admidinas, who had previously won the bronze world championship, was referred to as an Olympic medalist.
In May, Latvia set up a new national record (points 6622) and won a second place in the prestigious seventies competitions in the Austrian city of Gecis.
Ikauniece-Admidina also took part in the 2012 London Olympics, when she won the ninth place with a repeat of Latvia's record.
During the last half of the year, the sportsman has improved the national record four times.
Today at 16 p.m. the start is also scheduled for Latvian judo fighter Arthur Nikiforenko, who starts in the weight category over 100 kilograms, in the first place fighting Azerbaijani sportsman Ushangi Kukauri.
Judith will have these first Olympics in his career.
LETA has already reported that on Thursday the weight category up to 100 kilograms of loss already experienced a Latvian judo cyclist Jevgenijs Borodakko in his first battle.
He joined the Japanese Hagu Rjunoski, who later got the bronze.
In 2000, Vsevolod Zełonijs brought the award of the Olympic Bronze to Latvia, but in the next four Olympic games, Latvian militants won only one victory together in seven fights, which was made directly by Borodavko in London.
16.30 Following the shooting of the Latvian qualifying competition stage, Dainis Uppelnieks will begin, but the selection will end on Saturday.
The official received the Olympic passport only on the day of official notification of the composition of the Latvian delegation, but later he revealed to the agency that it had been quite safe to travel since April.
The sportsman came as one of Latvia's first athletes instead of the Olympics, trying to make maximum use of the training opportunities for the competitions in the shooting.
19.05 After the final three trips of Latvia time, the 17-year-old Olympic player will be the Latvian military officer, Ketia Birzule, who competes in the battle for windmills in RS:X class.

On Saturday, the final journey for medals will take place.
Today, it is also planned to take part in the academic arraignment, where the Latvian representative of Ireland is to participate in the Sanita Pušpure.
Wednesday the competitions were cancelled due to adverse weather conditions.
At 19.10 p.m., the Pušpure will reach C/D in the semi-finals, fighting for the 13th place in the Olympics.
On Tuesday, on the fourth day of the final journey, she guessed the fourth place, from the third position, which would allow her to continue the fight for the medal, leaving for no more than 0.65 seconds.
Pušpure fought for 13th place in London four years ago, when he also represented Ireland.
Today, 24 medal sets will be divided into Olympic games: bow shooting, light-wing, three-wheeling, riding, swimming, tramping, jogging, academic flying, shooting, swimming, tennis and weighting.
Reid claims that if Clinton is elected President, he will appoint Garland as Judge of the Supreme Court.
The leader of the Senate Democratic Party, Harry Reids, is convinced that if she becomes president, she will appoint Mariku Garland as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The party of the Senate Republicans has blocked Garland's approval since March when President Obama appointed him.
The Senate's majority leader, Mich Maconnell, announced that the next president would be elected to replace the current Supreme Court judge, Antonina Skali.
On Thursday during his conference, Reids announced that it was certain that Clinton would choose Garland.
Reida later reported that he had not personally talked to Clinton about this subject and that they were merely speculations.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to take a boat with another choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. District Appeals Court.
Reid said that the Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are "containers" and act in the interest of Donald Trampa, president of the Republican Party.
He also said that Trump was not suitable for the work of the President.
Treatment shall be notified of the calendar to women and men.
The Journal of Treatment will work with photographer David Belmer to create a 2017 calendar in the 70th century style of Pirreli.
In its 2017 NU Museum calendar, it is planned to demonstrate the new supermodels, not the famous kale.
At the beginning of this year, the president of the treaty told Steve Shaw that his erotic art magazine differs from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is a man's magazine".
This magazine is for women.
Looks like he's talking about a calendar too.
The press release on the establishment of a calendar reads: "We must return to the images of a non-lethal and classical image of the calf, where women's bodies are not silent, but inspired by both women and men."
Women would like to take part in this project because it is a great art work.
Models can be sent to your photos in electronic or personal boxing sessions in Los Angeles and New York.

The French court rejects the requirement to destroy shops in the jungle refugee camp.
The French court rejected the request of the institutions to destroy dozens of self-made shops and restaurants in the "Junglich" camp, where several thousand refugees live.
At this court meeting in Kale this week, the authorities indicated that the state should demolish 72 self-made shops where people market various goods, such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer hairdresser services, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for some euro self-made restaurants.
In Kali, the Bureau of the Prefect indicated that these self-developed companies must be cut off because they create a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as create fire and sanitation risks.
The representatives of the humanitarian group explained to the court that these small businesses are important because the food provided by government and support groups does not provide for the needs of a camp where the population continues to grow.
They also indicated that self-made shops and restaurants often offer free meals and food to those who need it most.
The Court held that there was no legal basis for dismissing the people who had created 72 self-made shops, but that it understood the concerns of the Prefect.
Justice Jean-Français Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a greater role than simply providing food for people who live in "very rare conditions".
He pointed out that these places are peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites that are at risk of extinction is a camp cafe "Jungle Book Kids", which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French language activities and provides advice on asylum issues to hundreds of unprotected minors without adult assistance.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition for the protection of the children’s cafe.
The Guardian-addressed letter states that the liquidation of the cafe "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
On Friday, two charity organisations "Aid for Refugees" and "L'Auberge des Migrants" announced that the number of residents of the "Jungju camp" has increased to 9,000 people, which is the highest rate since the rapid influx of migrants in the summer.

The silver medal that was then the third medal in Great Britain was a prize of peace. Britain's election can be proud of its achievements in the first Olympic regbi-7 tournament in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A heavy semi-final in which the Boks team suffered with the result of 7:5 days in the first half, possibly played for Britain at the end.
But in any case, Fiji's choice is now in its best form to also win the 15 men's team.
Although unlikely, the British may have been satisfied by the fact that at least one Brit has won a gold medal. This is Fiji's main coach Ben Ryans - former English coach from Vimbldon.
Britain had an exciting experience.
Eight years ago, under Rayena's leadership, they lost all the games at the 7th stage of the series in Adelaide.
This time they lost only one game.
Sacrificing is painful, but growth is surprising.
Fiji began to make an impressive start in the pursuit of British forces in the pursuit of pleasure.
Captain Tom Mitchell and the members of the team were meeting with a number of buses and the World Series champions in command of 5:0 when Osea Collins was the first to join.
In the last four minutes, too, Jerry Tuwai has increased his influence even further by making a landing in the right wing.
Result 12:0 and the British team were not even really hit by the bomb.
Michèla’s great strength did not allow the famous Leon Nakaram to get three points, but it only slightly affected Fiji’s outcome.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua won a landing in the right corner, strengthening the UK's balance to 17:0.
After the overpowering Nakarava even increased the balance and had remained more than a minute... at the end of the first half-time.
Vatemo Ravou was avoided by some inefficient British forces and crossed the line by winning points.
The landing provided the result 29:0.
It seemed that Fiji was born to play regbie-7 in matches while the British were just learning.
Actually, that's true too.
The British team made a fundamental change in half-time, reviewing Fiji's line of players... full of four minutes, which at first half-time standards was good until Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic team team, won a few more points for Fiji's team.
Den Norton managed to get points for the British team by making a landing in the left corner and getting the result 36:7, but the game had already been lost, while the fans of the South Sea salinaries sang, approached the flags and danced in the courts.
Fiji’s life - giving attitude cannot be admired.
Mata William made Fiji’s victory even more sweet with another landing at the end of the game.
When the game was over, Fiji could start celebrating, but the British could only sit in the hall after the crash.
On the first half of the day, the semi-final Fiji conquered Japan with a result of 20:5, whereas the British were too much of South Africa, where in a very intense struggle both teams were on the ground and South Africans lost only a few points.
In the first half of the year, Kyle Brown was led by Boks, but in the second half, Den Norton, with brilliant skill, crossed the line and delivered a bomb between the poles, providing British victory.
Markus Vatsona, a member of the 15th English team player Antonia, provided the team with a win and another silver medal at the end of the game.
Trainer's fight against cancer inspired Helen Gloves and Heteri Staning in the fertilization competition.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in these contests and it already says a lot.
From the first to the last, Helen Gloves and Heteres Stannings had a special role on the Estacio da Lagoa route.
Although there are only two sportsmen on board, she was accompanied by Robin Williams' support, which inspired her to the second Olympic gold medal in the women's fertilization, becoming the first women in the British history to succeed.
They no doubt dominated them, for on the 39th time, they won an unprecedented victory.
Both great athletes with a swimming elegance slide across the surface of the water do not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind each gold medal, there is a whole team working hard to continuously improve their performance and the greatest contribution they have made to their success by a coach who didn't know if he was going to live that day 30 months ago because he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had urinary cancer, which is one of those that can operate, and it happened.
If I didn't, it would spread across the body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
It's a bit of a change in your vision.
Viljam cancer was discovered in December 2013.
The three concluded that William could start the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 interim season and reduce the duration of the interruption to a minimum if it can be said.
I needed income, so I needed to recover quickly.
It stimulated recovery.
I was in the hospital, and I got 6, 10 and even 15 meters long, even though the doctor said that I would take some steps.
It all started.
Ironing itself is a challenge, but this time it was even bigger.
After the victory, the first thought was immediately about Williams, who was very concerned all morning and spoke more than usual about the excitement.
Staninga, who served in the Royal Artillery unit in Afghanistan, said, "This was an emotionally difficult week, but it means a lot to me."
It just confirms how much it means to us and how much I, Helen and Robin have worked.
The three years spent with Helen and Robin have been wonderful.
Without Robin, we wouldn't have achieved anything, so thank him so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I can't imagine a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glovere and Heteres Stanning have not lost in any competitions over the past five years.
The pair achieves such a huge speed that a competitor cannot compete with.
Even the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to get close, Staning and Glowers were too large.
We felt every moment.
Helen said, "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
It is really important not to lose concentration.
We had a good start, but at the same time we had no high hopes.
On that day, we were not meant to throw up the records, but we were just good at flying and winning competitions, and we did.
A few years will rest to decide what to do next.
The following month will be the marriage of the applicant Steve Bashale of Gloves and TV experiences.
In the meantime, she simply wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say that these were my last game.
It would have been too much pressure.
In London, I needed about six months to understand that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience, and I was very excited.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "The feeling is fantastic."

The Collegiate VID will "go to the last" in the office of the Head of the VID.
According to him, now Prime Minister Māri Kučinski (Green and Agricultural Union) and Minister of Finance Dani Reizniecei-Ozolai (Green and Agriculture Union) are already "primarily important" for the candidates headed by the Minister of Finance to be approved by the Head of the VID.
Rayevskis estimates that both Kučinski and Reizniecei-Ozolai in this government are the "first major decision" that can affect him as a politician's future.
If the position of the head of the VID is now changing, it will have a negative impact on the government of the government of their Immigrants.
The next week's agenda of the Cabinet of Ministers has included the question of the transfer of the head of the VVD to the post of Director-General of the VID, the government's agenda.
Mr Reizniece-Ozola, Minister of Finance, took the office of Head of the Collegiate VID following the resignation of Mr Peterson from the service and the completion of the invitation to tender for the office of Director-General of the VID without result.
On Thursday, 11 August, during an interview with the Head of the VID, Dace Pelēk allowed Radio - if she offered to run for the manager's office, she could agree.
The Minister of Finance later admitted that there are no other candidates for the VID's office at the moment.
The Head of the Saeima Group of the National Association, Raivis Dzintars, also acknowledged that the NA is still supporting the Kolīgov VID.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing the budget deficit threatens the failure to set up a government.
On 12 July the European Commission (EC) delivered its opinion that Spain and Portugal did not take sufficient measures to reduce the budget deficit to 3% of the total domestic product (GDP) required by the euro area.
The calculations show that in spite of the savings measures implemented, the Portuguese budget deficit at the end of last year was 4.4% of GDP, and in Spain 5.1%.
However, the European Commission decided not to apply economic sanctions to both countries, while setting fiscal targets for the next period.
One of the reasons why the EC did not impose sanctions on the two countries is the increasing European skepticism in many European Union countries.
Additional sanctions would only increase such negative conditions.
Critics point out, however, that the EC does not consistently agree on common rules in its decisions from the beginning and then fail to apply them in life.
For example, German President Jens Veidmann pointed out that Europe thus loses confidence in itself, creating an idea in its citizens that the rules of the European Union are recommendable, not binding.
The EC has now proposed and all Member States have approved extending the budget deficit settlement period until the end of this year for Portugal and for Spain by 2018.
The European Commission promises to examine the progress achieved by both countries over the coming months, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be ready to introduce further measures of savings if conditions so require.
The initial forecasts show that Portugal's target could be achieved at a given time and that already this year the budget deficit could be reduced to 2.5% of the total domestic product.
This means that, within the framework of the Stability Programme, this country's government needs to implement savings measures of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in the budget for this year, paying further attention to the control of the costs of the purchase of goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complex.
This year the budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year - to 3.1% and in 2018 - to 2.2% of GDP.
In addition, the consolidation measures for the next two years should be 0.5% of GDP per year.
The particularly difficult achievement of these objectives is the fact that, for eight months, the Spanish political parties have failed to agree on the establishment of a government, and the possibility of Spain becoming more and more vulnerable to the third time of the year to hold the elections of the early parliament is already being held.
However, public opinion polls show that even the third-election political scene in the country would not change significantly.
The most popular party is still the current Prime Minister, Mariano Rahoy, of the nation's leading party, whose vote will be rescinded by 33%.
Its popularity has increased a little only by socialists, while the popularity of the "Podemos" or "Ciudadanos" or "Pilsonis" against the rescue measures has decreased a little.
The People's Party wants to get Socialists and Ciudadans involved in the government this month, otherwise it will not succeed until mid-October to adopt and submit to the European Commission for approval of the 2017 budget.
As the representative of the People's Party's Parliamentary Group, Rafael Hernando, has announced, if the government is not successful and Parliament's elections are to be held for the third time, Spain will become all European fun.
The purity of the floodwaters in the Riga Sea River is critical.
In the fifth year of the survey of beaches, activists have concluded that, unfortunately, the number of found waste is increasing each year and that visitors to the swimming resorts are guilty here.
The most polluted bathing grounds are in Riga.
In the mind of the capital, it is clear that bathing places are expensive every day, but fighting against unclean visitors is quite difficult.
In addition, waste left in the dry land during rainy season can be drained into water, thereby significantly improving its quality.
With the exception of Liepaja beaches and places in Kurzeme, the purity of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
This week, the volunteers of the campaign "My Sea" have made such a statement.
For the fifth year, while measuring the road along the Riga Sea River, activists have concluded that the number of waste left by the population has increased every 100 metres.
Unfortunately, this year's critical assessment has come to an end.
"We see that this will be a year when the number of wastes on the beach at 100 metres can possibly even exceed 200 units," says Janis Ulme, representative of the expedition "My Sea".
The Latvian Radio called, he was located on the beach of Tuva, where he continued his voluntary journey along the Riga Sea.
This year, even day - to - day fires left in the sand have been collected between the various household wastes and the picnics.
The tour operator and organizer Ulme said that people are responsible for pollution.
"The main source is the beach visitors themselves, because more than half of the total number of waste is plastic, different waste, starting with bags, plastic pieces that are already in the decomposition phase, they can no longer be identified, and smokers, bottles, corks," says Ulme.
Among the cleanest beaches are also swimming resorts in Riga.
For example, in Daugavgrīva, on average, nearly 800 waste units are collected every 100 meters, which are critical.
The organizers of the campaign also make it clear that every step has been taken by smoking and not by any sign of warning or ban.
"The large figures for all three Riga swimming pools together - Daugavgrīva, Vakbolļi and Vecáči - unfortunately meet a large and far beyond the desired goal, or the goal, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020", the environmental defender concludes.
Cleaning of bathing places in Riga every day, during the hottest days of the summer, even twice, explains the representative of the council Ugis Viduskis.
However, fighting with unclean visitors is quite difficult.
We return to the cultural issue of these people.
"For those who mix, use alcohol, smoke and do all the things that are not allowed, even special signs do not work," Viduskis says.
Vidauskis therefore calls on the visitors to report to the police about the polluters.
You can call the police, safely point to these violations and thus fight everyone.
Perhaps new warnings can be imposed, but as I said, a lot or something will change the situation radically.
"As all must simply turn together and be impatient against such offenders," he stresses.
In the meantime, water quality measurements have already been carried out for the fourth time this summer as a health inspection, which may set a ban on official bathing grounds.
This year, as in other years, water quality has always been good and satisfying.
The situation is that in all 56 bathing areas, water quality has always been good and there is no restriction on bathing.
"For the last time we will take the analysis at the end of August," says the senior environmental specialist Norman Cadíčis.
During heavy rainstorms, waste left on the ground may be drained into water.
This, in turn, can affect its quality, says an environmental expert.
The rotations in the Russian elite will continue - change in Putin's administration.
You're gonna leave the office?
Vladimir Putin announced to the Russian media that Sergey Ivanov would leave this post on his own and will continue to be the President's special representative in the fields of natural protection, environmental and transport.
In reporting on the changes, Putin's television camera dedicated to Ivanov's words of appreciation: "The dear Sergei Borisovich, we have been working together for many years and doing so successfully."
I am satisfied with how you fulfill your duties entrusted to you.
I would like to recall our agreement without using you as the head of this President's administration for more than four years.
That is why I will act with understanding against your desire to change the field of activity.
And I hope that you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience in your new job.
However, it is noted that the management of the President's administration is a very important role and made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
Given that the elections of the State Council are to be held in Russia next month, there are rumors that this step is linked to the fight for power in the political elite of Russia.
Ivanov was also referred to as the possible Vice-President of Putin, therefore the claim that he himself wanted to take over the role of the President's representative in the field of natural protection and transport has raised doubts.
According to the Lsm.lv archive, Ivanov is the head of the VDK and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been a sensible and close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He began his journey in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
On the other hand, the first Russian President Boris Jelcina was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council at the end of his reign.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, Ivanova's "Information Security Doctrine" was approved, which included the recovery of state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001 Sergei Ivanov became the Minister of Defence of Russia, but in 2005 he was the Deputy Prime Minister of Prime Minister Mihaila Fradkov and was responsible for the development and export of weapons by Russian defence companies.
Now, following the resignation of the President's Head of Administration, Ivanov will also remain in the Russian National Security Council, where the new President's Head of Administration will also be working.
Vaino comes from family councils in the elite.
Ivanov himself recommended the office of Head of the President's Administration.
Anton Edwardovic and I have known each other a long time.
From the time we worked in your government.
And in the last almost five years, we've met practically every day.
"That is why I am convinced that, according to all the professional and personal characteristics, he is ready for this work," Ivanov said.
Vaino comes from a family belonging to the council party elite.
His grandfather Karl received high positions in the Communist Party of Estonia, including his first secretary until 1988.
The Internet edition "Meduza" with reference to the book "Self-determination and Independence of Estonia" says that at the end of the 1980s Karls Vaino was asked to allow Moscow to use force against demonstrators.
However, he was rejected and soon lost his job.
Soon thereafter, Vaino moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino has graduated from Moscow International Relations Institute and manages Japanese.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the management of the President's protocol.
It has already been reported that in recent decades Russia has been disrupted by the resignation of several high-ranking officials and even arrests, including the replacement of several district governors and federal representatives.
As Politology indicates, President Vladimir Putins is re-electing the ruling elite before the 2018 elections.
One of the main features is that the leaders are increasingly represented by the bodies of the forces.
Nikiforenko is also killed in the first battle of the Olympics.
This was the first round of the fight, and the Latvian Judjigs have concluded their participation in the Olympics by finishing at 17th place.
Coach Oläg Baskin admitted to Latvia's TV that the Nikiforenko's hope was very low, and it was already clear before the competitions.
He also discovered that he was a martyr in a battle who suffered a back injury.
Significantly, in order to get to the Olympics, Nikiforenko had to start in a weight category other than a weight category - i.e., a weight category of up to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani battalion was more than 20 pounds [25 kg] in weight.
It has already been reported that Jevgenijs Borodakko’s weight category of up to 100 kilograms against Rjunosuki lasted for two minutes until the opponent’s release of a valid year of pure victory.
Therefore, the jury competition in Latvia is closed.
The snakes disappear in Rio's sand.
Thursday was introduced by Jvgenijs Borodakko.
Yes, he had a more titled opponent, but ambitiously sometimes he was able to bring a surprise.
He wasn't working.
Arthur Nikiforenko’s task was even more complex, as his experience is less experienced and the opponent is also respected.
The result is similar, though on the tatami he held the tea half a minute longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, in recent times, Latvian Jewish people have lost the most ambition.
Since the beginning of the federal administration, Gunárs Ügres and his financial staff, Vladimir Šestakovs, took off from Latvia, Aleksandr Jackevich, no longer "Golden Score" is happening, - the judo's development is rolling down the slope.
Jackevich, who is here consulting Kazakhstan's Jewess, and Vsevoldam Zeljon doesn't see the property.
But if he doesn't grow up, he won't.
And it's a federal prorogatory.
Therefore, as from the other galactic "Rita panoramic", the promise of the President of the Latvian Judo Federation to beat the medals was scanned by Rio.
Flight far from reality.
In the evening, we waited for the beach volleyball cat Samilovs/Smēdīņš - Evandra/Pedru Solbergs.
Intrigue as already in the "death" group - the losers have finished the game.
Latvia's duet was a small derogation - it could also be lost, but not more than four points in two sets.
The tension was still growing in the slowest game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling over the windward windward of the card all along the sword.
To the players, the brass wind caused additional difficulties.
At first, it seemed that it could be our - which is the most comprehensive - community.
But it didn't.
Against the Latvian duet to play here was quite simple.
He's so on Samilolu and he's waiting for him to break up.
Against Canada, against Cuba at the end of the first set, and at the beginning of the third, because the load was not by joke.
At the time, he was able to fish because the work was small, but when he was there, he did so with honor.
The Brazilian Samilovs and Semédin could win in two sets because the first took over at 16:15, but also on 16 left the limit of the lost point.
But it could also be lost with 0:2, because in the second set the deficit was -4, however, thanks also to the wind, it was able to win.
The third is already the seal of the Gospel servant.
A chain formed - an unconfirmed servant, the second play often flies too close to the network and Samilova has left little option for a successful attack.
If there was a foreign Samilov in the Cuban countryside, he would be more successful this time, and only on Sasha would be the unprofessional loss.
Kreil also made a mistake, and quite symbolically, that the last bomb block hit him directly.
We're losing the team.
There was certainly also a lack of success at this time - in the third set only two Evangelical attacks almost flew out of the card, but the bomb hit the line.
Two wheels were next to the line.
The controversial episode of the video also benefited the opponents.
If, in the first two games, the Gospel was taught by servants, they were very productive to us.
All total losses on the table.
The causes of failure must now be properly analysed.
Perhaps like many living next to the stadium, not with the delegation in the Olympic village.
It's been two and a half hours.
Perhaps a little self - confidence led to a series of seven semi-finals.
Perhaps you should not play in Klägenfurt, but you should come here faster and better acclimatize.
Perhaps there was a mistake in finding the surface of the sport form.
Let's wait for a question more than an answer.
The game's over.
The dream of the medals is over.
What's next?
There are still some World Cup tournaments and also Jurmala's "Masters".
The meeting with Samilolu has never been and will never be, because there are too many personalities.
But that's not necessary either.
When the dream of the Olympic medals is broken, it can also be thought of divorce, because it will be sought not only by itself but also by a partner.
It is not difficult to decide, but much more difficult in Latvia will be to find a worthy partner.
Both brothers are playing chess, but John and Tom have already tried and divorced, while Mikhail Samilov is still too green to start picking up the tops of the world.
You can try Harald Regž, Alexander Solovej, Edgar Toču, to return to Martin Plaviņš, but it will not be better than this option, which has not only confirmed itself in the stages of World War II.
Copacabana’s sand did not laugh at them this time.
And sure.
Of course, it should also be taken into account that the beach volleyball is becoming more popular, new pairs come in circulation, and only rare growth is less than two meters.
It still fails to succeed, but there is an important argument in the fight for victory.
We don't stay longer.
Both sportsmen and journalists have the opportunity to swim in the places offered by game organizers, as well as to choose their own.
The U.S. basketball election lives on a cruise ship, but the tennis player does not stay in the Olympic village.
Also, some of the beach volleyballists have found a hotel in Kopacaba.
This time, high prices were demanded for journalists for all decent accommodation.
So the choice also fell on the rent of the apartment.
The risk is because sometimes they can be uncomfortable from the point of view of logistics.
This time the risk is justified.
Along with Vladimir Vladimirović, we rent apartments on the Kopacaba and Ipanema border.
The beach is 200 metres away, half an hour away.
The area is quite safe, since the favela is sick, however, it must not be lost here.
Vladimir Vladimirovic is not what some people think immediately, but the most professional sports journalist in Russian media, Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. It seems that another medal dream was blown up on Friday morning.
100 meters in the barber's chest and uplifting Laura Ikauniece-Admidini's retreat from her personal records.
But there are still five disciplines.
After 10 years of interruption, "Porgy and Besa" scan in Liepaja.
In Latvia, opera "Porgia and Besa" was first studied in 1973 at the Latvian National Opera.
Since then, the internationally recognised masterpiece has not been reintroduced.
That is why the organizers of the Cēsu Art Festival and Liepaja Art Forum decided in close cooperation to provide listeners with the opportunity to enjoy George Göršvina’s masterpiece.
"We are very pleased that after a ten-year break, when Liepaja was last able to enjoy the opera impression, this excellent version of the opera by George Géršvina "Porgy and Besa" concert studio is delighted with us in the new, newly opened concert hall "Greece"", says the concert hall "Greece" by the leader of "Greece" Baiba God.
Opera "Porgis and Besa" is a story of love, its insatiability, passion, and the tragedy of the home and simple daily joys.
It reflects African American vitality, music and rhythm.
It is precisely this lack of political correctness in this opera, this exclusion of tolerance makes it so alive.
"And yes, this love story is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and in a way really deep," says Viesturs Kairis.
What I like most - listening to or playing this opera, there are always such stop points - famous melodies, famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to another by lighting one character or another character, or choir, or orchestra.
"It is the most exciting, this building", the opera evaluates the music director and director Andris Poga of the concert studio "Porgy and Besa".
Opera visitors agree that this is a great event.
They are delighted to hear this world’s famous Görschvina opera.
Blessed for feeling the world’s breath in Liepaja.
"Performance professional", the opera is appreciated by the visitor Edgars Lams.
The concert studio was special because in the newly opened concert hall "The Great Gintars" played the orchestra for the first time in the orchestra and for the first time the opera concert was held.
The restored buildings of the Museum of Art could be named on behalf of Jana Rosental.
Riga Vice-Chairman Andris American at the opening of the rosary exhibition said that the museum's own address in the future could be, not Krisian Valdemara Street 10a, but Jana Rosastal Field 1.
The museum’s director, Māra Láce, acknowledged that the re-registration of the address would create a severe bureaucratic burden, but generally this idea was appreciated and therefore agreed to the municipal proposal.
The foundation of the city of Riga has been laid for this idea in 1936 by establishing the monument of Burkard Jean to Janim Rosental, who stands at the museum.
The then director of the museum, Wilhelm Purvits, was one of the initiators for the creation of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be quite logical.
I don't think I'm feeling a little broken all the time - but Wilhelm Purvitis, where are we going to leave his name?!
"But, if you, Mr. America, have given up on your mind," said Lace.
It was reported that the National Art Museum was officially looking at its doors this May after extensive reconstruction and modernization.
This weekend will finally start the reconstruction of the VEF Culture Castle.
SIA "Velve" has been updated for about 11 million euros.
It is planned to refurbish several castles, including two viewers’ products, as well as to adapt the building to people with movement disturbances.
The Riga Council has intended to attract a project of EUR six million from the European Union funds, but the Director of the Riga Council's Property Department, Olägs Burovs, recognizes that there is still no full clarity on the European funds for the project at the moment.
"Despite the political will to start the restoration of the VEF Culture Palace by attracting the European Structural Funds, it is, for months we expect a decision, a real action from the officials of the Ministry of Finance, whether or not it will be granted," Burovs says.
Last December, we were told that everything depended on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission that you should decide yourself not to take a decision here in Brussels.
Now we see another round of discussion being formed, so let's see what we can expect in the next few days.
"I want to say that Riga's mind undoubtedly guarantees that this process will be started and completed in time," Burovs says.
It has already been reported that more than a year before, in March 2015, the VEF Culture Castle collectively held a holiday concert prior to the immediate renovation of the building.
Although the year had passed, the renovation of the building had not yet begun and had continued to work collectively under inappropriate conditions.
The Riga Council's Property Department's strategy for the renovation of the VEF Culture Castle has apparently been divided into independent reconstruction teams, where each will ensure the implementation of the different functions of the castle.
The first is to increase access to the cultural castle of VEF and to improve the area.
It aims to organize environments and engineering communications and to restore the facades of the building.
2nd - Improving the offer of cultural castle services.
It plans to improve the study of interiors, walls and ceiling restorations, scenes and sound recordings, as well as to arrange internal engineering communications for buildings.
Third - Improving the collective working conditions of amateur amateurs, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary, the legendary handcuff can be seen at the exhibition in Liepaja.
The exhibition will feature various "Līus" features - photographs arranged on a time line to reflect the group's activities from the beginning to the year 2010 when the group's end is announced.
The audience's clothes, musical instruments, awards and concerts will also be shown, as well as other things not yet seen for the wider audience, which reflected the activities of the "Līvi" group.
The exhibition will be complemented by the objects of the Liepaja Museum.
The visual representation of the exhibition was made in cooperation with the fashion artist and painter Elito Patmalniecis.
The musicians, who were associated with the "Līvi" group and their relatives, also responded to the call and shared with both objects and memories.
The beginnings of "Levi" are searched in 1972 when a vocal instrumental assembly led by Juris Pavitol is created in Liepaja's cultural house.
The assembly took part in its original composition in 1972 and 1974 at the festival "Liepājas djintars", as well as in the views of the city and the Republic.
In 1976, a fatal meeting took place when Juris Pavitols met with Eric Kyigelli and a group was formed in the Metalurgy Museum, inviting him to join Ingrid Gūtmani, Andri Krūzyņi and John Grodum.
Over the years, the composition of the group has not changed once.
Participants have joined, others have gone their way, some have returned.
However, the main thing - the desire to confirm that Latvian hand music is able to live and exist - has remained unchanged.
"What to see without a hint - jinxed, matatine and bearded, these boys felt different from the stereotype of the generally accepted construction songbook," says music viewer Klás Vávere.
In the group without the above-mentioned musicians were excellent musicians such as Igo, Vilnius Krieviņš, Modris Sterns, Valdis Starks, Laimis Racenejs, Telis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Bríze, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Thomas Kleins and many others.
In the exhibition at no charge.
The exhibition is held from August 19th to October 30.
On the other hand, in the 27th season of Liepaja's concert hall "Pūt, winds" will be held by the group "Līvi" for 40 years of the festival "LīVIfest 2".
For the first time in 8 months, there was inflation in Bulgaria.
In July, Bulgarian national statistics showed 1% monthly inflation.
This is the highest indicator since 2012 and the first indicator above zero since October when it was positive (0.2%).
The average annual inflation after PCI in the last 12 months (August - July 2016) compared to the previous year was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to the previous year was 101.9% and the average monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year, inflation rates were -0.2% (July 2016 compared to December 2015) and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 there was an increase in prices for the following consumer groups: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); entertainment and cultural activities (6.3%); hotels and restaurants (1.2%); household goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased for clothing and footwear (2.2%); household appliances, household appliances and regular household storage (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the level of the previous month for alcohol and tobacco, for management, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Zbignjev Stankevich: The time is coming, and the truth is on the way.
The archbishop of the Catholic Church of Latvia, the metropolis of Zbignev Stankevich, in the interview The Independent stresses that if we want to gain life, we must put the Gospel message in its centre.
For the power of the truth is greater than that of the wicked one.
Many are already on their way to the reception of the Most Holy New Mary in Aglon.
What message will faithful ones receive in this year?
In recent years, the desire to take the lead in the ministry in Aglon has been expressed by a papyrus minister.
Hence, the main message is in his own mind.
For its kind of tradition, it is also the fact that the cross way leads the Shepherd John Bull.
He's gonna make his own message, too.
I led the Christmas service last day.
Last year I turned to the French encyclical "Laudato si" and updated the total house in it, the theme of the Earth in the context of Latvia.
This year... of course, I've seen what's going on in the world, and I'm trying to respond to it in my speech.
My approach is to agree with the church’s recommendation that the Gospel message be kept in the center of life.
It should be shown that the Gospel accounts for the most painful problems in human life and that it inspires him further.
Then it speaks to people.
But Ceses, in the Lamp discussion, you said that "he returns to the understanding of the whole human being."
What do you understand?
Does this mean that people are turning away from the message of the church?
And does the church have such a return resource today?
In the capital of India, a man dying on the road to the road.
In the capital of India, no one is aware of a man dying on the road - it appears that he has been lying on the road for an hour and is still missing, reports the BBC.
It has been reported that a man who was identified as Matthew went on a journey day by day but worked night for protection.
Matthew 5:30 in the morning went home on the road, when he was hit by a light car.
The surveillance camera records indicate that the driver has left the car to look at the victim and then left.
After an hour when no one was left to know about the bleeding man, a mob beat him.
About 90 minutes after the incident, the police arrived and the victim was taken to a hospital where he died of the injuries he suffered.
In response to his candidacy at the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID), the Head of the State Environment Service, Inga Kolīgova, welcomed the government from falling, is considered to be Professor Oårs Skudra, an associate of the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Latvia.
Collegiate explanation of the withdrawal of the candidacy in the conflict-management coalition is linked to the fact that it has prevented the government from falling.
Skudra spoke to the agency LETA and said that he found it difficult to imagine that next week at the government meeting, he would support Kolügov's candidacy.
Therefore, if the ministers of the "Units" voted against, but Kolígovu had so confirmed, it would lead to the government's resignation.
The expert also considers that, prior to the notice on the withdrawal of the candidacy, Kolígova has consulted both Finance Minister Danu Reiznieci-Ozola and Prime Minister Māri Kučinski.
At the same time, it is also the accession to the "Unity", which strongly opposed her candidacy.
When predicting whether a candidate will be able to find an appropriate candidate, Skudra acknowledged that there are two options - either a compromise figure will be chosen, or the institution will continue to run in Dace Pelēk as the executive director of the Director-General.
At the same time, he points out - if the Minister of Finance has so far claimed that no other candidate is being examined, it is home to Peläkay that he must not participate in the competition.
LETA has already announced that the Head of the State Environment Service has decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of Director-General of the VID.
Due to the "unity" objections, the government postponed the approval of Kolīgova on Tuesday to the post of Director-General of the VID.
After the Government's decision to postpone the decision, Kolígova confirmed that it is still ready to become the leader of the VID.
However, he later changed his mind - on Friday, in his submission to Minister of Finance Dan Reizniecei-Ozolai, he indicated that he withdrew his consent to transfer to the office of the Head of the VID and that she did not have an easy choice.
Prime Minister Māra Kučinska Press Secretary Andrejs Vavars explained to the agency LETA that a new competition would be held at the VID's vacancy.
There was an accident in the centre of Riga involving a police car.
A road accident involving a State police car took place this afternoon in the centre of Riga.
The police car with the sound and light signals on it will rush to the highest level of call until Krišijana Barona and Dzirnava hit another car across the street.
The police explain the circumstances, but the initial information shows that the police car has not been launched for a second time.
In an accident, a woman suffered.
This year the population in Riga has fallen
At the beginning of this year, 638 784 people in Riga were 0,34% less than in 2015 when 641,000 people were officially registered in the capital, LETA informed the Central Statistical Office (CSP).
On the other hand, in terms of population, the capital of Latvia takes place in the 30th place between the capitals of the European Union (EU) and the major cities in which the population exceeds one million.
According to data from the EU Statistical Office "Eurostat" in Riga, the highest proportion of women is - the capital of Latvia is in the first place between the largest European cities with 127 women per 100 men.
In all three Baltic capitals, women are the largest in Europe's largest cities: in Vilnius they are 123, but in Tallinn 121 women are 100 men.
A warning icon shall be displayed at LNMM.
In the coming days at the National Art Museum of Latvia (LNMM) there will be warning marks - pictograms, LETA told the agency, the representative of the Department of Property of Riga Council, Baiba Gailite.
At present, the museum has successfully closed up the repair of glass-speed damage caused by the operation of shimmerboardists.
Warning pictograms will be displayed in the next few days.
They will tell the public that the roof is a snowy rain and must not be moved by cars, and to visit by bicycles, slippers, and slippers.
On that social network, Facebook was also written by Ushakov, who pointed out that no security threats would cause damage, but "seemed to be insurmountable", and the borderists "will be able to recover".
Celebrations for children and parents - New children's playgrounds are provided in Riga.
During this summer season, the Riga municipality has set up even two new playgrounds in the city, Kipsala and Čičurkala, which are already available to children.
On Kipsala beach, a large, multi-functional toy ship with various elements, bridges, games, pipes and ski lifts is installed.
Toys are intended for children of all ages.
The field also includes hoses and various balancing elements.
The fantasy world for small shipowners is expanding the attraction of Daugavas coast with a view to the passenger port and the cruise ships that are visible there.
On the other hand, in the playground between Čiecurkalna 4 and 5 cross-sections, the game house, the boot, the stage track, the balance bridge, the ball, the ball and other elements of the game, as well as the swinging area with the rings of force and coordination trains, the accessories etc.
Below the area is the rubber cover in different colours.
Up to the playground on the street included a new colourful board cover.
In honey, the reconstructed stage of the road was discovered.
Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, the management of VAS Latvian State Roads (LVC) as well as the representatives of the construction companies SIA Binders and municipalities today discovered the Russian border of the reconstructed state main road (Grebnăva) -Rēzekne-Daugavpils-Lituvava border (Medumi) (A13) step from Medjum to the border of Lithuania (156.4.163.5 km).
The roads are a national tourist map, especially border roads, so it is a special pleasure to discover a reconstructed stage on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of how the co-financing of the European Union funds improves the situation on national highways.
"As the forecasts show, the resources available for roads during this planning period will be made available in 2018, and we need to consider how to continue maintaining the most difficult roads in very good quality, and also to ensure the mobility of the population in all regions of Latvia without the European Union funding," said Uldis Augulis, turning the symbolic table.
The Minister of Transport also pointed out that proposals prepared by traffic experts on sustainable financing for the roads of Latvia will be presented in the near future by the government.
During the construction phase from Medjugorje to the border of Lithuania (156.4.163.5 km) SIA Binders started earlier and this year continued after a technological break.
The reconstruction costs are EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), the project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"The reconstructed road phase is completely renovated and the next year will begin repair work from the Medum to Daugavpilij itself, thereby arranging the entire road from the border of Lithuania to Daugavpilij," said LVC Chairman Janis Lange.
The main roads of the country are the most difficult, and by 2018 we are planning to achieve that all the main roads of the country are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, ensuring periodic maintenance in a timely manner and to replace the asphalt surface every 7-9 years.
"There, of course, will be a need for adequate funding, and all passengers with hope will be in favour of the proposals made by the expert group for the organisation of the road financing system," Lange noted.
Within the project, road connections and lighting are arranged in the centre of the Medum.
Significant land works have been carried out: during the four stages, large-scale cooling and large-scale storage and storage works, a balanced long-term profile, which has so far been very uneven.
Public transport also has a refurbished and refurbished area for public transport.
Before the roads, there was insufficient insomnia and area reliefs were not transparent because of the mountain valley and the old road of the common cliffs.
The next construction season is scheduled to restore the road phase from the Daugavpils city border to the reconstruction phase (144,80,156,40 km).
This year LVC plans to perform various types of work more than 1,100 kilometres of national road.
Information on all repairs planned on the national road network this year is available on the LVC website www.lvcelli.lv.
"To achieve the desired results of weight reduction, it is very important to choose the right food combinations," admits Lithuanian diethologist Laura Romereite-Kukleriene.
Moreover, it is easy to achieve during the summer period when fresh fruits, berries and vegetables grow in our own gardens.
The combination of food products considered can help not only reduce excess weight, but also to promote the various processes of the body in a targeted manner.
Macarones and etiquette are a successful combination because they provide a long-lasting sense of sweetness and help to fight fat.
Studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Food have shown that the label has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us feel the wall.
Cayenne peppers and protein rich food, such as poultry meat or protein cocktails, creates not only a sweet feeling, but also a reduction in meals after large meals for the next meal.
The combination of such foods can also increase the quantity of calories consumed by the meal to up to 35%.
Studies have shown that Cayenne peppers can help to get rid of fat in the abdomen.
The egg contains a metabolic food - choline, while the pepper is a good source of vitamin C.
Taking sufficient amounts of this food can reduce the level of cortisol, thus also the accumulation of fat around the body’s middle.
There is another dish and a fat burning meal for a meal that is worth adding to your menu.
Oats and oats contain fibers that, according to Canadian scientists, control the greline - an appetite-stimulating hormone - and thus also the sense of hunger.
In addition, the feathers contain polyphenols that are helpful for weight reduction and do not allow fat formation.
Plants and proteins can also perform miracles in reducing weight.
Such a combination can create a sweet feeling.
Grains contain water and fibers, which contribute to the feeling of sweetness.
At the same time, protein slows the digestive process and provides sweetness for longer periods of time.
In the afternoon, you can eat a meal with salads or also make protein cocktails from the ready mix and enjoy it with your favorite gardens.
Avoid any combination of products.
There are sugars in the fruit - monosaccharides or dissaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
On the other hand, the starch in the vegetables is polysaccharide.
The fruit is mechanically divided into the stomach, but it is not chemically divided until it reaches the third or fourth degree in the digestive process that occurs in the intestines.
The starch divides into three different stages, starting with the mouth.
Therefore, it is important not to eat frozen food immediately after meals.
Eating a frozen meal immediately after meals, it is "prostituted" in the stomach with other foods, where it is not chemically dehydrated and begins to vomit.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, cereals, bananas, data or other carbohydrates with lemons, lime, oranges, grapefruit, pineapple or other acidic fruit.
Enzyme ptialine, which is in the shell, works only in an alkaline environment.
Fruit acids are not only inhibited by dehydration of carbohydrates, but also by promoting their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheeses, meat and milk, eggs and milk or milk and similar protein-rich products in one meal.
The processing of these requires various digestive juices, each with different strengths, characteristics and time to get into the stomach.
Arbuz, medusmelone, muscatmelone and other melons should always be eaten separately from other foods.
Melons are not dehydrated if they are in the stomach together with other foodstuffs.
Fats in combination with protein-rich products.
Fats are a successful combination of starch, but the same cannot be said of fats and proteins - fats prevent protein contamination.
The protein can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If a large quantity of protein is consumed, avoid the use of fat completely.
This also applies to refreshment - it is not recommended to combine large amounts of rice (contained proteins) with whole avocado (contained fat).
Such a combination prevents effective weight loss.
How better to prepare?
"Food preparation, thermal treatment results in a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the original food ingredients," the dietologist said.
In most cases, food is lost by storing food in water.
However, the value of some foods increases, directly heating.
After boiling the remaining liquids, it is recommended to use them for the preparation of soup - in this case you will not lose the nutrients left in the water and you will be able to eat them later.
It is recommended that vegetables be prepared, including by steaming them.
The thermal treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of lycopene contained in tomatoes.
When you store tomatoes for 30 minutes, the amount of lycopene increases by 25%.
The thermal treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of beta-carotene found in red, yellow, orange plants, such as tomatoes, burcans, sweet potatoes and spinach.
The thermal treatment of eggs and meat takes away the natural properties of the existing proteins, making them easier to digest.
Also, the thermal treatment of meat and eggs makes the iron and other mineral substances present in these products easier to absorb.
It should also be borne in mind that freezing of the products can reduce vitamin C levels from 10% to 90%, although the freezing of the fibre does not affect.
In combination with tomatoes, bees may increase iron intake in the body, which in turn provides better brain and muscle function.
Our body absorbs up to 33% less non-bloody iron found in plant products such as bees, leaves, cereal products than the blood-producing iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and view.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-blood-creating iron in the body by using non-blood-creating iron products with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and eggs.
Vitamin C helps change the non-blood-creating iron so that our body can absorb it more easily.
Iron is required for the production of hemoglobin, which provides oxygen supply in the muscles and brains.
To get the maximum benefit from salads, add healthy fats such as olive oil or linseed.
When preparing butter with a lass, add vitamin D rich salmon or sardines with a free yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the intestine and has an important role in bone formation.
Gold (as well as other full grain products) along with vitamin C sources, such as soils, ovens, avenues and other fruits or eggs, helps to stabilize cholesterol levels, as well as avoid arterial exposure.
Snapchat Anime's effect criticises Asian caricature
Snapchat representatives say that this filter has inspired animation, but some commentators claim it is racistly insensitive.
With this smooth effect Snapchat allows 150 million users every day to change the reality and play with their identity completely absurdly.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or an image that would fit Roy Liechtenstein's painting.
Springs are cloudy, image-misleading instruments that generate more than 30 million transformed selves per day.
Any mistake quickly becomes public noticeable.
Snapchat lens effects have already been criticised by getting the impressions that the application is popularizing too black or bright face tone as an ideal beauty benchmark.
This week, new lens effects were published, allowing users to form soluble eyes, soluble teeth and round face, and some critics called it a racist Asian cartoon – "golden gums".
It was also asked whether such contradictions did not indicate that the company had greater problems with diversity.
News and public denials broke out on Wednesday when the expenditures “The Verge” and “Motherboard” announced that the lens effects were removed from the application.
The company explained that the lens was intended to picture the images of Anime rather than to caricature people of Asian origin.
But for people who have experienced racism, these effects have reminded them of painful stereotypes.
Others categorically rejected the similarity with Anime.
The entry about the images by the students of Korean American art from Greece Spapani Twitter received a broad resonance. In her e-mail, she indicated that the smooth effects were "apologetic and uncomfortable to say no more".
She added that it is difficult not to see the apparent similarity between Asian caricatures and lens effects.
This shows that the smooth effect is not simply a yellow face, but a yellow face in terms of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has been involved in these cultural laps.
American culture is also involved in an endless fight for diversity and inclusion, ranging from the premises of business meetings to Hollywood and the devices we use daily.
And Snapchat's great young audience, which represents different races, unlike the elderly, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that misleads users, then "to this day such things are not left to be noticed", the 25-year-old Katie Jou said in a Thursday interview.
On Thursday, the company’s “Medium” product manager Žou will delete his Snapchat application and advise others to do the same.
In her article "Medium" and a telephone interview, she explained that, in her opinion, racial problems arise due to Snapchat's employment policy, which does not adequately support racial diversity.
Jou criticised the management of the company, which consists mainly of white men and then concluded his article with reference #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there are no racial differences in the company, so such decisions are allowed. Whether some other racial representatives are working in the company, but they do not take a position to express their views safely and comfortably," said American Zhou of Chinese origin.
Her opinion also agrees with others, whereas Snapchat did not respond to her complaint.
The company does not discover how many employees represent different races, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of his employees, but his representative found that the company had hired a staff specialist who would focus on representing also racial minorities that were not widely represented and would promote inclusion in the company.
Jou, however, will not update his Snapchat account by adding: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to understand that it's not right."
The Chamber of Congress declares that military officials have reduced reports on the Islamic State.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the Chamber of Congress notes that the representatives of the US Central Order have narrowed the reports, depicting the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria far more optimistic than is true.
Analysts of the Central Command Investigation Service express general dissatisfaction with the interim report of the task unit set up by the Armed Forces Committee, the Investigation Committee and the Sub-Committee on the Protection of the Republics, stating that their management controlled reports on the success of the Americans in the fight against the Islamic State.
The central order, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news about this report is that the intelligence reports confirmed by senior Centcom leaders reflect the US's fight against terrorism more positive than is true.
The representative of the Republic of California, Ken Kalvert, says: "Centcom's actions are unacceptable - our soldiers are the ones who suffer if our policy makers receive false reports."
Centcom management errors are sought for by organisations in the highest management.
This 10-page long report details the existing problems in the reflection of the Central Order and analyses the efforts of the Americans to prepare the Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide inconclusive evidence that Obama’s senior officials had failed to clarify the reports, it shows that Centcom’s management has put some pressure on analysts to take a more optimistic view of the threats posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report indicates that, in the first half of 2015, the Central Management Press Releases, Communications and Reports presented to Congress the situation in a much more positive light than it was in fact.
For example, representatives of Centcom publicly announced that the Mosula recovery operation could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosula is the second largest city in Iraq, still under the control of the Islamic State.
The representative of the Canadian Republican Party, Mike Pompeo, in his report, said: "The investigation of several months clearly confirms this."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the US Central Management Chief Officers have narrowed the reports, drawing the ISIS threats in Iraq weaker than they really were.
The Republican Party set up a working group to find out that analysts are concerned that information about the Islamic State is being corrupted.
For further investigation, the report published on Thursday will be followed by new findings in this case.
The General Inspectorate of the Ministry of Defence shall conduct an investigation into the activities of the Investigator-General Centcom.
The members of the Democratic Party of the Committee of Inquiry published their own report on Thursday, which they agree with some of the conclusions of the Working Group of the Republican Party.
The representative of the Democrats Adams B. Šifs, in his report, reported that Centcom was too limited to the preparation of daily survey reports relating to the ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces from 2014 to 2015.
Mr. Šifa explains that this process "stopped the dissemination of information", worsened the work of analysts and "displaced false facts."
But the members of the Shefs and the Democratic Party added that there is no evidence that the White House has put pressure on the analysts of Centcom to draw up reports according to the "pre-defined or political position".
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the congress investigation on Thursday.
In August The New York Times reported that the Pentagon General Inspectorate initiated an investigation into Centcom's complaints.
The representative of the Pentagon, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, announced that the Pentagon would not comment on the congress report until the investigation continued.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data differently, and the Ministry of Defence and the Department of Investigation calls for a constructive dialogue on vital issues of national security.
The investigation is not limited to the question whether the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a claim made by more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's accusations raise doubts as to whether President Obama can fully rely on the Central Management reports on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot spots.
Criticism regarding Islamic State Intelligence recalls more than ten years ago events when an analyst for Centcom published a study by Gregory Höker, claiming that the administration of the Bush began the war in Afghanistan, thinking too little about its possible consequences.
Hücker also played a significant role in opening up the question of Islamic State.
Last year, officials reported that the Hücker team found that, contrary to public reports, air raids did not significantly worsen the financial situation of the terrorist group because they had built temporary factories to sell oil in the black market.
In the September edition, The Times reported that this discovery did not come out of the central management walls.
At that time, Commander Centcom, General Lois Ostin III, received a criticism of the tears, as many lawmakers felt that the war reports described the situation too positive.
In April, General Austin retired and replaced General Joseph L. Votels.
In the United States due to British women's field hockey, the U.S. wins, thus winning the fourth in turn.
The day after the victory over Japan with the result 6:1, on Thursday, Katie Bama won the first two gates of the US women's field hockey team, when the Americans won the Indian team with the result 3:0.
Five gates in the two games are an unforgettable achievement, but 27 - year - old Bama said that she could not remember what had happened to her at one time.
She said, "I don't even feel."
I'm not one of those people who count their gates.
But she knows that the result of the Americans in the Olympics is 4:0, which gives them in their group an indistinguishable with the United Kingdom, which won over Japan on Thursday with the result of 2:0 unbeatable.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday to play the last match in the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for a quarter final and the game will only determine which team will take the first place in the group of six teams and which one.
The first winner will be a little longer away from the meeting with the strong Dutch election, which is the leader of the second group.
Although the Saturday game is not open, the Americans have already called for a surprising wind, four years ago, when the last place between 12 teams was in London.
That team also had Bama.
She grew up in Bluebel, and for the first time she took the wild hockey knot in her hands at the age of 3 years (her older twin sisters had already worked with this type of sport in Drexel) and joined the national election when she was 16 years old, becoming a selection in the history of the youngest players.
She was not at the 2008 Olympics because she did not enter the finals.
In 2012, however, she and her team failed.
The next year, Craig Parhams was appointed as a selection coach and everything changed to the right side.
Bama called it "cultural, mental and physical change."
In London we did not invest as much as we do now.
We have completely changed everything.
In the fourth day of the game Bama discovered the result, winning doors in the first half-time with the back year from close distance.
India's game started without victory in its own account, but their selection was very smooth and held a minimum result 0:1 to the end of the third period when Bama repeated the gates.
She introduced a bomb in the area on the left side of the field, and then she noticed going to the middle of the field and blowing the bomb at the door of the enemy, placing the Americans in the direction of 2:0.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melissa Gonzales had another gate.
This was the first game of the U.S. Guard Briggs dry, in each of the first three games to go through one gate.
She's stuck.
And so is Bama.
"We are going very well now," said Pahams, but how good exactly will the game be on Saturday.
The most refreshing meal of the period of depression is "Satful meal"
In March 1933, shortly after the election of President Franklin Delano Ruzvelts sat in the oval room to stop the meal.
President Ruzvelt enjoyed such delicious culinary delicacies as the zosu liver pasta, or fuagre, and the Meriland murky soup.
However, his meal was much more fitting at that time: a handful of eggs filled with tomatoes, potatoes, and flowers in the desert.
Jane Ziegelmane says, "It's a way of solidarity in cooking meals with people who were very serious."
Her husband, Andrzej Kou, adds, "It's also a message for Americans as they should eat."
A couple from the Brooklyn Heights area are food historians.
As described in the last book of the Chinese cuisine in America, Ziegelmane describes life through the food rental home in the eastern part of Manhattan.
Their new joint work "Satan meal," which will be published on Tuesday by the Harper edition, is a story of American food during the Great Depression.
In expressing some solidarity in the culinary, they held a meal together with the reporter "Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop", at a simple lunch table located in the Flatiron area and operating since 1929, when great depression began.
54 years old, Mrs. Ziegelmane ordered butter with roasted cheese and raspberries, while 57 years old Kou ordered turkey, potato beet and vegetable salads.
When the reporter ordered counterfeit zacks, a few admitted that his choice was very suitable for the negotiation of the Great Depression Times meal .
Ms. Ziegelmane told me that the fake rabbit was very popular.
There was an earthquake, a liver disease, and a bee fever.
They were prepared from the basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine what it's like to eat so many peanuts that they'll be in lunch.
Mr. Kou said it was new.
"It seemed to me that the belly was full of lead," he added.
In the pre-depression years, the American lunch table was similar to the Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women were prepared to eat their men-workers and in breakfasts, lunches and dinners were served freshly prepared spices.
During World War I, Americans sent food directly to Europeans. "Satan's meal" was described as adapting Americans to conditions when America was no longer a land of overcrowdedness.
"At that time the food became the main object of the people of America's daily attention," said Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write directly on this topic.
Just as important became the new budget diets: food such as counterfeit rabbits and wastes became daily, wastes were "a great way to use surpluses," said Mrs. Ziegelmane, as the gates could hide unattractive ingredients under creamy measures.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheap dried fruit.
The meat, which for years was the main ingredient of the American meal, now became an extremely rare luxury product.
At a time when the number of calories and the nutritional value of food were more important than the taste, the gender was new, yet unimaginable.
In an old manuscript, Mrs. Ziegelmane found a recipe for the preparation of strawberries filled with peanut butter.
Mr. Kou adds: "It was not a popular lunch table supplement."
Ms. Ziegelmane said, "It was surreal."
Groundnut butter and potato juice are not compatible.
Many home food recipes were used during difficult times.
Household economists such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Economic Bureau of Households from 1923 to 1943, defined state eating habits that were not experienced before or after the Great Depression.
By publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they recommended that households become "economics" and accept challenges such as converting the blend of pasta and burkina Faso into a delicious meal.
"Sat of Malta" is a historical sweetness.
It is particularly interesting to witness the government's attitude to its starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hüver's "let me eat corn".
Although he publicly told of his simple childhood and eating in Aivo, he actually ate as a fine millionth of what he had become.
Mr Kou said, "He liked the European cuisine, such as fish with gourmet sauce."
He's eating in an almost yellow living room, wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely lost in reality.
President Ruzvelt would have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not recommended him to set an example with his eating habits.
The book tells us that Ruzvelt would reward the host who did not learn to prepare to eat, and thus the White House became a place "not only of the worst food in Washington, but also of the worst food ever prepared".
As soon as the country's economy recovers, the majority of the population lost their culinary culinary status.
But we continue to pay attention to calories and nutritional value, as well as to the use of science in cooking, Mrs Ziegelmanes added.
Some say that in writing the book, they gained a greater understanding of Mrs. Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits, such as why she was unable to throw out food.
"She was really afraid to throw out food," said Mr. Kou.
Mrs. Ziegelmanes said, "She actually cheated on people."
Sometimes there was an accident with windshields.
After we had eaten at Eisenberg’s dining table, a couple of writers pulled the dessert prepared in the summer house: a flower bottle that President Russvelts had eaten for lunch.
"It is plumbing," said Mrs. Ziegelmanes, adding that at that time the habit of giving a nice name was widespread.
It does not contain poultry, only dried flowers, a few flours, sugar, water and cane.
All of them eagerly wrapped up in the brown mass that was on the solubles.
Surprisingly, it wasn't that bad.
Mr. Kou ate some more coumas.
Listening to the experienced "economicist," he told his wife, "I'd like to wear a piece of straw. "
Gilead will receive a refund for legal expenditure in the fight against Merck on Hepatitis C patent
The District Justice has decided that "Gilead Sciences Inc" is entitled to recover the costs of legal services it has paid in the case of the release of Hepatitis C patent against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc."
In June, Gilead was justified in the case of 200 million pounds of fines for two Merck patents, which threatened it with the success of Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets, when the US federal judge found irregularities in Mark’s activities, such as lying after sworn transfer and other non-ethical activities.
On Thursday, U.S. District Justice Bets Labson Freeman pointed out that Gilead has the right to claim compensation for the legal expenses incurred by it in defending the case.
Merck is trying to get positions on the market against Gilead, which dominates the market with new generation Hepatitis C medicines, which are effective in 90% of liver diseases.
The case was started in 2013, when Gilead and Merck appealed to each other, trying to acquire ownership of the newly developed active component sofosbuvir, which is the main component of Gilead medicine.
The US-supported forces claim that they have taken full control of the city of Manbida from the Islamic State.
The US-supported forces have completely taken over the northern part of the city of Manbiga, at the border of Turkey, and the last Islamic State soldiers have left the city, the group's representative announced Friday.
Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are now cleaning the city from the last fighters who have not yet left the city.
They have released more than 2000 civilians-civils who had been captured by the fighters, Reuters told Sharfan Darvišs of the Manbida military council of SDS.
"Now the city is fully under our control and we are carrying out a search for warriors," he informed the agency Reuters.
Clinton's income in 2015 amounted to $10.75 million and a couple paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published a 2015 tax statement showing that the president of the Democratic Party and her husband have earned $10.75 million this year and have paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent, respectively.
During 2015 Clintons donated $1 million, mainly to his charity organization. Former president Bill Clinton earned about $5.3 million, acting as a speaker and former secretary of state earned $3 million from his book on work in the State Department, published in collaboration with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton's election partner - US State Senator Tims Keins and his wife Anna Holtone have published their tax statement for the past 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hilaria Clinton and Tims Keins continue to set new financial transparency standards," announced in their statement to the Clinton campaign partner, Jennifer Palmer.
On the other hand, Donald Trumps is hiding behind various intentions and objections in order not to be able to meet the promises of disclosure of his tax information.
The publication of tax information is a record practice for the US President's candidates, but it is not required by law.
New York businessman Tramps and his lawyers called the State Revenue Service audit as a reason not to disclose tax information.
"That's a go," on his Twitter entry, Ian Sams, a campaign partner of Clinton's campaign, told about the tax information of the Democratic Party.
On Thursday, Trampa, Special Adviser Michael Kohens informed CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish tax information before the audit has been completed.
Critics, including Mits Romnij and other Republicans, of the president of the Republican Party of 2012, claim that his refusal raises questions about his real estate, the amount of donations and other business obligations, including those of Russia.
Clinton lit oil by publishing a video on Friday, where several influential Republicans demand Trump to publish their tax information.
She returned to the matter during the economic debate in Michigan on Thursday.
She said to the effort: "He refuses to do what the other presidential candidates have done for decades."
Politico reports that during the 1990s, tramps paid very little or no taxes, and on Friday the New York Times business column author reported that many bookkeepers and lawyers believe that nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are an important issue in this President's election.
Clinton, with the support of the billionaire Varena Bafeta proposal, popularizes the idea that every person who earns more than $1 million per year must pay a tax of at least 30%.
This proposal is also supported by President Barak Obama.
Last week during Clinton's speech in Omaha, Nebraska, where his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, Bafets invited Trump to exchange tax returns.
Bafets said he was also audited by the Revenue Service and Tramps was afraid of voters, not tax authorities.
The Clinton campaign has published tax information until 2007.
Clinton now lives in Čapakva, New York and has paid the average federal tax rate from 2007 to 2014 at around 32 per cent and the total tax rate at around 40.5 per cent.
Clinton's 2015 tax report shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is paid.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund from which Clinton has received $109,000 in dividends.

The director of the Jewish film criticises the hotel in Berlin about the closure of the Israeli telephone code on an Arab request - RT News
The director of the French films of Jewish origin raised a wave of social media when he discovered that the hotel in "Kempinski Bristol" is not available in Berlin. The hotel staff base it on the Arab customer requirement.
Klods Lancmans, a documentary film director of the holocaust "Shoah", did not hide his discontent with the Berlin Hotel "Kempinski Bristol" and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During the recent visit, Lancmans tried to find the list of Israeli telephone codes in the hotel.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries to which you can call directly from the hotel number.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel has been devastated and destroyed?
The writing of Lancmans.
Instead, the "Kempinski Bristol" hotel offers to call this country through its call center.
The Director requested an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancman writes that the answer he received "was shocked".
The hotel administrator explained that "it is a known hotel management decision".
The reason for the removal of the code was even more interlinked with the film director.
"Most of the guests are Arabic and they asked for the removal of the Israeli code," Lancman quoted the hotel employee's explanation.
Suddeutsche Zeitung reports that the Israeli Ambassador to Germany James Hadas-Handelsman has referred to this case as "great shame".
We are surprised and shocked at this incident.
The same is a big shame to yourself.
And the fact that this has happened directly in Germany, it is in this hotel network that there is even more humiliation.
No comparisons are required.
The official said, "We hope that the hotel will make the right conclusions."
This event also gained a fairly broad resonance on the Internet, where people called it scandal.
Others believe that the "Kempinski" hotel has simply been issued to Arab customers.
Another entry said, "Blow down," indicating that the hotel is located in Kurfurstendamm street next to the synagogue.
The edition Der Spiegel writes that the hotel itself quickly rejected all the advances, declaring that it was all "understanding" and apologizing to Lancman.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of national numbers," Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted Kempinski as saying.
It adds that the code has been added to the list again.
Police use rubber balls and tear gas against Protestant students in Brazil.
Student and police clashes took place on Thursday in the city of Sanpaul in Brazil, where students gathered in demonstration against government education reform.
Police used rubber balls and tear gas against students.
The problems began when law enforcement tried to wipe out students, as a result of which the police used rubber balls and tear gas.
A number of hundreds of students participated in the demonstration to show their dissatisfaction with the reform of the education system.
The proposal by Governor Geraldo Alckmina of Sanpauli is aimed at closing almost 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be transferred to other schools with a view to saving funds.
Some demonstrators drew graffiti on the walls with messages against temporary President Michael Temer.
This protest took place only a few days after the previous protest, when the students gathered in demonstrations in order to support the resignation of President Dilma Roussoff, whose influence was voted against by the Senate.
Scott Kellums Skinners finish first, bringing UK gold medals to the wheel
Kellums Skinners from Scotland finished his first men's race at the Rio wheelroom that took place last night. The British team protected its championship title, which it won in the 2012 London games.
The 23-year-old sportsman from Glázgova played an important role in these events, making Seru Krisu Hoi a proud legendary scot and bringing victory to the favorites of New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won an amazing victory when Hoys fought the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they also repeated it at the World Championship in London, although Hoys had already finished his sports career.
The problems were at a stage between Beijing and London Olympics, as the experienced start-up specialists, Jamie Staff, had to be replaced.
They made it last minute.
When Hoys left, he tried to fill up the site of Kins Emadi and Mets Krampton.
British coaches hoped for Skinner, viewing him as a potential he later proved.
Hindi, Kenya - champions who started four years ago with Hou and Skinner, who installed the Olympic Qualifications Record, but the best start was for the New Zealand team
However, the British trio won gold medals.
The Hindus were very angry, Keny took the lead, and Skinner took care of it.
The change of strategy played an important role in winning, as the Hindus drove with greater transport to allow Kenya and in particular Skinner to drive faster.
Hoys watched as a BBC representative and caught sights of Skinner, Kenya and Hindu eye when they dug on an honored pedestal.
The 23-year-old painter said, "It was an unforgivable disgrace."
I'm doing my best to defend my name.
At the end, we installed the Olympic record and won the World Championships.
It was simply unbelievable.
There's no better victory.
After winning the 2012 Olympics in London with Kenya and Hou, the Hindus admitted that they were willing to go on the track after a failed start.
He later reinforced this comment and the British competitors were not able to prove the contrary.
There was no such incident at the time.
The Hindus said, "The flags of the Great Britain have been recalled in memory of London."
In the last 3 months, we have become a sworn team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so victory in the Olympics was truly special.
A medal will be given to a country that has won seven of the ten gold medals in the race in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is the indicator of the team's progress over the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
In view of Kenya’s outcome, he could really repeat Hoja’s success by acquiring three Olympic gold medals.
It would mean six prized gold and one silver medal. Furthermore, Kenius was born on March 23rd (it seems to be a British holy date because Steve Regreivs, Mo Farahs and Rogers Banisters were born on this day).
Hoys was born on this date.
Kenya's next competitions are split, which starts today and will continue for the next three days.
28 years old sportsman from Bolton said, "Now I'm just enjoying it all.
The team's journey is always the best.
Because then you can win with the team members.
If it's true, then winning one's a little bit lonely."
Hindus said, "If he gets two more gold medals, he should be assigned to the army."
On that day it was the only battle for medals, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bredley Vigins, Eds Clensey, Steve Burkes and Owens Douls showed the fastest qualifying time for four kilometres.
Their time was 3:51,943
The world record that was installed in London in 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and final will take place today in the second half of the day, where Viggins will certainly be in the center of attention.
Yesterday before the qualification trip, he had disagreement with the Commissioner when the judges summoned him to measure his growth.
In the women's journey, which will continue and be completed today, Laura Trota, Joanna Rovsela Shanda, Elinor Barkere and Katie Archibalda of Milgavian installed a new record time of 4:13,260.
The British delegation hopes that the British wheeling team, hoping to win the medals in the middle of the Olympics.
Remembering the outstanding and unprecedented achievements in Beijing and London, everyone looks forward to the same achievements as Rio.
Meanwhile, behind the scenes are different, after charges of sexualism and contempt, derogating technical director Sheins Saton, and the career ends also with Hojs and Victoria Bendleton.
However, at the beginning of the first velodrom competitions, it seems that the UK will always reach the highest level in the right time.
The future of Portland's basement is uncertain, as a huge contract is terminated.
The future of the aluminium boilers and hundreds of its employees in Portland, Victoria, has become unclear as its main customer has announced the interruption of cooperation.
This Communication is based on the Victorian Government's plans to suspend the subsidy of the energy company, which is vital for the company to continue its work.
For 20 years, subsidies will be suspended in November.
As a result, more than 2000 jobs in the Alkoa Portland are at risk.
The risks could be up to 2000 for both direct and indirect jobs.
In addition, it will also have invisible side effects as the boiler consumes about 10 percent of all Victorian electricity.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry basement, leading to an end to the operation of the English Power Station.
The Alkoas Portland shed works with losses and can be closed.
These events led to years of speculation about the rise of the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of production of the plant.
The supplier of energy of the plant "AGL", which supplies energy from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrouba Iele, says that the other three owners are likely to terminate their contracts.
Most of the power plants are owned by the Alcoa and Alumia Joint Undertaking, in addition to the company's shares also belong to the holding companies of CITIC and Marubeni Corp in Japan.
"AGL" is looking forward to the continuation of the operation of the Portland plant, which would mean further supply of energy to the basement," said its representative.
‘AGL’ stated that contracts are so-called ‘risk-restrictive contracts’, which are intended to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month period and will therefore be valid until 2017.
"AGL plans to receive revenue from these contracts also in fiscal year 2017," said the company representative.
From the fiscal year 2018, the potential impact on profit is limited to favourable market forecasts for electricity wholesale prices in the future.
‘AGL’ claims that its forecasts have already calculated losses of $187 million , providing that these contracts will be terminated .
Alcoa reports that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa's ability to continue the operation of the basement or to supply energy to it.
The US company announced that in 2010 it had concluded a contract with Loy Yang for 20 years, but in November it will be terminated.
Analysts have expressed concern about the possible closure of the Portland Castle in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the poor economy of the sector.
“AGL” Executive Director Stevens Mikelson said last week that 600 megawatts and tomago 900 megawatts were spent during the year by analysts during Portland.
If both of these plants were to withdraw from the energy market, the demand for energy would be significantly reduced.
And that wouldn't be good at all.
The Community legal centre rejects 160,000 people each year.
Every year, more than 160,000 people's demands are rejected, while the budget is reduced, the situation could deteriorate.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to fight illegal oppression - are denied free legal assistance and representation.
The Community's legal centre, which is already overloaded, warns that reducing funding will only make the situation worse.
From June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than so far.
The Director of the Legal Centre of Queensland, James Farels, said that the latest report of the Association of National Legal Centres reports that legal assistance is now being denied to thousands of people who need it.
Mr. Farels pointed out that if this decision was not repealed, the situation would only become worse.
He also says: "The legal centre of Queensland is constantly receiving insufficient funding, which means that the aid is denied to thousands of people who need it."
People who seek to end violent relationships, people with deep debts, families who experience divorce, workers who are unjustly dismissed - all of these people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not receive the help they need.
With effect from June 2017, the federal government will reduce funding by 30 per cent, meaning that more than a thousand people in Queensland will have to deal with their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Attorney General and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to stop the funding reduction immediately so that people who need legal assistance can get it.
Last year, the government opened its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to focus also on the needs of local communities and their clients and the Palestinian Government to invest in this important area.
Donald Trump's campaign in court because one of the employees has been shot by a gunman.
New York: The organizers of Donald Trump's campaign were accused in court because they had not acted on the information that its North Carolina Operations Manager had turned a suspect against a staff member when they drove in a car in February.
This incident was described in a court order submitted to the Court on Wednesday by Vincent Bordini, the former programmer of the campaign.
Bordini said he had waited months for an internal review of this case to begin, but realized it would not.
Head Erles Philips "drawed a gun, placed his good indicator finger on the wall and turned his back on Vincent's road", Bordini claimed in his complaint.
He also claims that in submitting complaints to local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four more people have experienced the same.
"The weapons do not have to be fired to cause losses," Bordini writes in his complaint.
Only two days before the submission of this case, the candidate of the Republican Party to the presidency caused a scandal, informing people that "The People of the Second Amendment", i.e. the owners and enthusiastically, could take action if the election would win his chance of winning Hilaria Clinton and his elected judges.
The representatives of the trampo campaign announced that the media had taken his words out of the context, and he never gave up on violence.
Bordini wants to get compensation from campaign organizers for slow monitoring, but from Filips - for assault, the use of illegal weapons and the creation of emotional stress.
The trampa representative, Hoop Hicks, made no immediate comments.
He couldn't get in touch with Philip.
WCCB - Charlotte's local news agency reports that Philip recently left the campaign.
Nor has he managed to call his consulting company "Innovative Consulting Services".
The candidate Donald Trumps, president of the Republican Party, has carried out a controversial election campaign.

New tradition - the holiday of the countryside and sport in Ouļcie.
On Saturday, for the first time, people gathered for the holidays of the countryside and sport.
This time, after ten years of celebration, it was decided that Ezra’s festivals would no longer be celebrated.
The new page has now been changed.
The day began with sports competitions.
At the time, the competition was not traditional and too serious, because, for example, the shots had to be put to sleep, the dentist flew, with a man's left hand handle, "bombing" was not at all in any Olympic games.
However, each participant was able to show how strong, courageous, weak, and resourceful he was.
After the sports games, all gathered in the outdoors, where the holidays began.
At that time, the "child drive" also worked, where the little ones could get out in the exciting attractions and get a new picture in the closet.
The new one, which could also become a tradition, was a vehicle debt, with tractors and motorcycles.
Everyone spoke of the Inga Kadiķe-Skadinja, the head of the district administration of Ouļcima, who had a good time of rest and drought, but the rains fell, but it was not able to disturb much.
Celebrations continued with the greeting of the youngest inhabitants of Ouļcima.
Indeed, it is good that the village has been complemented by five girls and one boy.
The audiences were very pleased with the performances of the old dance set "Rudens rhythms", the performances of the various folk dance performers "Reds" and young dancers "Zelta Pearls".
And there was nothing on the screen that was going to happen.
Of course, local people and neighbors were delighted by the famous actors dute Janis Jaráns and Dainis Porgants, who were once again Mildinis Nabinis and Šidrit Kraninis, as well as the attractive women of Bérzciem from the fishing village "Dienņa".
Balli played a group called Bruges.
Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and expand its Hitrova.
This will not only promote prosperity and growth in local regions and in London, but also throughout the country.
This, I think, makes Hitrov very attractive, just as in 2012 in London, where we have invested a great deal of work so that all the national regions are benefiting from the Olympics.
Stratford and Istanda have won a great deal of the Olympics.
And we will do this again, by providing locals and businesses with business opportunities near Hitrova.
In the local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new business opportunities, 40,000 new jobs and finally add a point to young people's unemployment in the Hitrov area.
Like the 2012 London Olympics, there will be people this time who will think that this challenge is too big and that the expansion of Hitrov is too ambitious.
At that time, people said that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympics and that it would be a global waste.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012 and in the case of Hitrov, they will not be right.
There are always obstacles that must be overcome, but Hütrov has so far overcome everything.
Like the Olympic Games, Hütrova is an infrastructure project that benefits the entire society, not individual.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating both employment and experience at this airport and throughout the UK.
In Hütrov, an excellent team that has created a valuable 11-billion infrastructure investment programme, including in time and in the budget starting with Terminal 5, which has been designated as the best airport in the world for five years and finally with Terminal 2, which is built between the two most intensively used routes in the world.
Now they are ready to set up a third route, which will be financed by private investment of 16 billion pounds.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success, and I am confident that this will also be the expansion of Hitrov.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand the Hitrov by ensuring our future of trade and creating a new employment environment with which Britain might be proud.
Lords Pols Deiton is a member of the Board of Hitrov and former Secretary of Economic Affairs of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
In Switzerland, a woman rises up on the street trying to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night, he falls on the road.
The police are trying to find a witness in an accident when she had several cars on her way early on Thursday morning.
The accident occurred on Thursday after midnight on the A1 road near the town of Morges in Vo canton.
The Vo Canton police report said that she was desperate to commit suicide, and she had rushed to the darkness of the road, where she was taken by several cars.
Of course, trying to kill themselves, the victims, 49-year-old Swiss, drove several cars, including a heavy car.
She's good at the scene.
Several involved drivers have already given evidence, but others involved have not yet been identified, says the police, calling on the drivers involved and the witnesses of the accident.
The case has also initiated a criminal investigation, which in such a case is a logical step, the lawyer Gilles Hofstellers told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was It Possible to Avoid Controversy?
The prosecutor adds, "That's what the prosecutor will find out."
Two similar cases that have occurred in the last 5 years indicate that none of the drivers will be called to account.
In both cases, the walker had walked the middle of the night on the highway, so it was decided that drivers could not predict that the walker would be in the middle of the night, the mail newspaper.
Last year, a police officer was excused for being unconscious when in August 2014, she left for a man who slept in the middle of the night on the A1 road near Paijernes.
The court found that a 22 - year - old man was drunk and later found himself sleeping on the road.
The court concluded that a police officer who was on his way to an accident was driving in an appropriate manner and the judge recognized that the sleeping man on the road was "a completely unexpected and extraordinary case".
Anyone who has information about the accident on Thursday near Morges is invited to contact the police on the phone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
On the Internet, signatures are being drawn up for the appointment of a new Head of the VID.
The opening of the petition portal "Avaaz.org" for the appointment of a new Head of the National Revenue Service (VID).
The petition addressed to the Ministers of the National Association (NA) and the Green and Agricultural Union (ZZS) states that the company wants a transparent and professional appointment process.
The petition was created on the 10th of August, and it has now been signed by 55 people.
The proceedings for the appointment of the Director-General of the VID shall be transparent and non-professional.
It recalls the traditions of the Union’s best officials.
This discredits public administration and makes the public hope in the government and politicians the next time.
"There is a need for a competition with clear criteria against which all candidates must be assessed," the text of the petition said.
Its author, Janis B., pointed out that the public did not know the criteria as Kolügova chose for an office.
Nor is it clear what is the candidate's intention to work on the VID.
The request states that a new open invitation to tender should be made by the Office of the State, which is actively addressed by professional candidates, adjudicated staff members and an appropriate remuneration offered.
Last week, Finance Minister Dana Reiznieces-Ozola officially appointed the Head of the Collegiate VID, which was scheduled to be approved by the government this week, but all the ministers of the "Unity" party voted against, so the question of the week was postponed.
Samilov: If we lost, I played bad.
Pludmale volleyballists Aleksandrs Samoilovs and Jānis Šmēdīņš were hoping for the prize in the Olympic Games of Rio de Janeiro, but without it, there was no difference where the competition ended, Samoilovs said after leaving the tournament.
One of the world's most powerful beach volleyball couples in the final and decisive of the tournament of the sub-groups on Thursday with 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) lost the Brazilians to Evandra Gonsalveš Oliveira and Pedro Solberg Salgad, concluding their participation in the most important sports forum.
In the three subgroups, Latvian athletes won one victory, but the same relationship was two more pairs.
The relationship between three small points was listed below, which was the most unfavourable of Latvia's duets after the strong loss in the match.
"In the first set we were in charge, but from 16:15 we also stayed at 16 points", the game was remembered by Šmēdīš.
I don't even know how the rest of the set left without points.
It must not be played.
Then in the second set, everything was fine and the set was finally able to break the game, and it should also be a good foundation for the third set.
We started it the same way, but after we changed the sides, the result grew only for one team.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
In the subgroup, all teams were similar, almost all of them had three sets, so small points were important.
"We had to play a more similar game than to deliver 3-4 points in a row," said the sportsman.
We knew that the Gospel could be preserved.
"In the first set we met at the end, in the second we placed 1-2 points, but in the third at +4 he already left the game," Šmēdīņš recalled.
We were trying to show the best game.
It's been a while, it's a while, it's not.
I did not see the co-evaluation situation before the match, but it was known that there were as few points as possible.
"If we lost, then I played bad," Samoilov said.
We waited for a good servant from the Gospel, and in the first sessions we met quite well, but in the third, the servant opened up and found it difficult to make an attack.
On my own, I made a lot of mistakes at Pedro’s service, but it had to be done.
Samilovs told us that contrary to the previous match today, sportsmen were not nervous.
"We went, we played, there was protection, but we needed better service," said the sportsman.
"They played well, and in the end they've already met on "Urra."
Before the tournament, we just said that the explosion was as uncomfortable as it could have been.
We also had the opportunity to fight for the first place, but we did not even go out of the group.
"All of us expected a medal and we also expected it from ourselves, but then there are no more differences - 25th place or fourth," said Samilovs, who predicted that the duet will continue to play together in the future as well.
I think there will be no question and we will continue to play together, because this is just one tournament.
Samilova Riodezaneiro was already in the third Olympic career, as in 2008 he started in Beijing with Martin Plavin, but four years ago in London he played with Ruslan Sorokin.
In the meantime, this was the second start in the Olympics.
Latvenergo follows the process of opening the gas market also from the potential dealer position.
The state energy company Latvenergo follows the process of opening the gas market both from the consumer and from the potential trader's position, said the company's press secretary Ivita Bidere.
"The decision whether or not Latvenergo will join the gas market in the future as a trader will determine which gas market model and legal framework will be set up."
"That is why we are actively involved in the drafting and commenting of legislation and in submitting our proposals," said Bidere.
BNS has already written that the Ministry of Economic Affairs (EM), in cooperation with the Public Services Regulatory Commission and the energy company "Latvijas Gáze" has developed draft rules of the Cabinet of Ministers "Regimes for the sale and use of natural gas" which will change the existing operating principles of the natural gas market since 3 April 2017 by ensuring the right of natural gas users to choose the natural gas trader freely.
The aim of EM is to make the natural gas trade process as simple as possible and as easy as possible for the user to understand.
Therefore, as the most efficient and user-friendly service solution, the "central model of the trader" is chosen, in which all activities related to customer service are provided by the trader - one contract, one bill and one information and customer service location, leaving the technical issues of the natural gas distribution system to the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in electricity trade.
It should be recalled that the gradual opening of the market for households - even after 3 April 2017, those households that would not choose another natural gas trader will be able to continue to receive natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming related users.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas-related users at a regulated price is fixed for the public trader," the Ministry informed.
On the other hand, traders will have to choose a natural gas trader to conclude a natural gas trading contract.
By the end of a certain period of time for the conclusion of the natural gas trade agreement, traders will be provided by the current natural gas trader at its fixed price.
The draft rules of the Cabinet of Ministers set out in detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.
The rules shall lay down the arrangements for the supply of natural gas to users and suspend their supply, the requirements for safe use of the natural gas system, the trader, the public trader, the system operator, the user and the gas owner for the supply and use of natural gas; the arrangements for accounting for the services received, the percentage of delays, the arrangements for changing the supply of natural gas to consumers in the event of disruption; the arrangements for the provision of natural gas to connected users by the public trader.

Minister: It is planned to increase the remuneration of the VID Director-General next week.
Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Green and Agriculture Union (ZZS)) plans to talk to the government's partners next week about the increase in the remuneration of the Director-General of the State Revenue Service (VID).
Reizniece-Ozola pointed out to reporters on Friday that the issue of increasing the remuneration of the VID Director-General must be addressed urgently in order to make this position more attractive to potential re-applicants.
It was also discussed next week about changing the terms of the invitation to tender.
The Minister also stressed that she did not consider any specific candidate to be invited to the vacancy.
At the same time, Reizniece-Ozola expressed the view that the Head of the State Environment Service, Inga Kolīgova, would have been a good director of the VID.
On the other hand, with regard to the current executive director of the VID, Daci Pelēko, who has expressed his readiness to apply for this post, the Minister reiterated the view that the new Director-General of the VID should be "on the side" and should not come from the VID structure.
She also stressed that she was waiting for Saeima to return from her vacation to bring as soon as possible the amendments needed for the VID reorganisation.
BNS has already reported that the Minister of Finance, Head of the State Environment Service, Inga Kolīgova, has submitted a submission to Dani Reizniecei-Ozolai (ZZS), referring his candidacy to the post of Director-General of the VID.
In her presentation, she said it was not an easy choice, but in the last two weeks, her relatives have experienced severe emotional pressure, although they have not done any acts of law.
Kolīgova also pointed out that her candidacy consultation has increased in the conflict between the ruling coalition parties, which is also unacceptable.
It has also been reported that the former Director-General of VID Inára Peterson resigned at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to rise; exchange indices in the US and Europe are increasing, as well as the value of US dollars.
Oil prices in the world continue to increase in the morning of Friday, with the positive impact of investor attitudes on the statements of the Saudi Minister of Oil Affairs, which reinforces the expectation that the largest oil beneficiary countries will take action at the OPEC meeting in September to stabilise the world oil market.
The three main US stock exchange indices reached a record level on Thursday, which has not been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in the oil price and the strong financial indicators of several large companies.
The rise in the oil price and the strong financial figures of several companies were also the cause of the increase in European stock exchange indexes on Thursday.
The US dollar value increased on Thursday against the euro, against the UK market and against Japan.
The price of WTI's raw oil in electronic commerce in New York's stock exchange increased by $1.78 to $43.49 per barrel on Thursday September.
Brand Brent's raw oil price for deliveries in October increased by $1.99 in the London stock exchange - up to $46.04 in the stock exchange.
The turnover of the conservative producer "Zilā laguna" per year is reduced by 33.8%.
The turnover of the conservative producer "Zilā laguna" was EUR 4,202 million, which is 33.8% less than a year ago, while the company's losses decreased 5.7 times - to EUR 904.7 thousand, the annual financial report published by Lursoft shows.
In 2015, the Company’s management report stated that the company had suffered losses for several reasons, including in relation to the persistent lack of funds to be exchanged, resulting in the withdrawal of Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market, ending the previous credit line, and leaving the Green Laguna with concluded contracts without the possibility of executing them.
Consequently, the company did not have sufficient resources to purchase cheaper raw materials in large quantities and to receive a discount.
The withdrawal of the bank concerned from the Latvian market also enabled the company to implement projects of support from the European Union Structural Funds that would enable the factory to acquire new production equipment and modernise infrastructure.
Similarly, the company’s financial creators in the year’s loan had a negative impact on the increase in raw materials prices and the refusal of customers to pay more than the company’s goods produced.
"Only on the second half of July 2016 customers recognized price changes and were ready to buy goods for the new - highest - prices," company management said.
In 2015, the Blue Ladder also started negotiations with potential investors, including the evaluation of the company's mobile and mobile assets.
Investors have already been with the company's largest creditor "Unicredit Leasing", where the parties have identified and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company's activities and development had a positive impact on the implementation of the restructuring and optimization plan launched in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement and optimization of technological processes, which enables greater productivity and capacity to be achieved.
"Several equipment was purchased to ensure greater production speed," the company's management pointed out.
The management of the Blue Laguna notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company's production to carry out orders that have not yet been possible.
The first batch to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
Since the sales of the product have already been signed, all the products produced will be sold in accordance with the sales of the intended products.
The new product will increase turnover by around 300 thousand euros a month," the company's management said.
The company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement on supplies of fish production to Iraq in August 2016.
In 2016, the first experimental container has been sent to Israel, expanded the market for naeta to Cyprus, and this September will sign a cooperation agreement with a new wholesale chain in the United States.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase turnover.
In 2014, "Zilā laguna" worked with 6,347 million euros in turnover and 5,113 million euros in losses.
"The Blue lagoon" was established in 1997 and its core capital is EUR 1,156 million.
The company belongs to two Latvian private persons - Mikhail Kaidanova (89.1%) and Igor Širshon (10.89%).
Welcome to pl. 15 at the museum to wait for Zāra Leanderi film live and attend the press conference.
Riga can be seen as a city of the beginning and inspiration of the divine film of Zāra Leander's career.
The settlement of Zāras Lenderes at the crusader Ruth, who was a Swedish ambassador to Latvia, was considered fatal in 1924, because she had just discovered the unusual low contract for Zāras Lenderes' wife, who was trying to go into the theater theater in Riga.
Perhaps it was in Riga that the random question became a fatal turning point in the creative way of Zara against the glory of the world.
Riga Zárrai Leanderi was bound by warm memories, and she hoped to visit Riga’s visits, but unfortunately these hopes were not fulfilled because the Second World War began.
Using the form of the presentation, this meeting will be possible in Riga in 2016 and the excellent role of Záras Leanderes will be played by Ieva Kerēvica.

The insurer shall pay compensation on Wednesday for passengers cancelled at the airport.
If Insurance has paid a travel insurance fee to a family on Wednesday, the cancellation of the flight at Riga Airport on 10 August, which resulted in the cancellation of the planned music festival visit.
On 11 August the insurance of a client received an application for compensation.
The family had planned to go to a music festival in Belgium, but since it was not possible because of the air travel cancelled at the airport on Wednesday, the customer was paid for a night reservation that could no longer be cancelled, as well as for the tickets purchased at the festival amounting to EUR 204.
On the other hand, the airline has promised customers the money spent on aircraft tickets.
If Insurance for all travel insurance claims has been paid on average 15% of the compensation for termination or cancellation of the journey.
"This is the time to pay for the purchase, delivery or exchange of tickets, as well as for the booking of accommodation," says Dagni Rutka, Head of the Insurance Person Risks Product.
As it is known, on 10 August, a private plane was stopped due to technical problems at Riga Airport, so only several departing flights were cancelled, but several incoming flights had to be sent to other airports.
Because of the repair of the fireplace, the man is at the edge of the trench and the pressure is to leave the house.
The LTV broadcast "4.Study" addressed Dmitrijs Saidjašev, whose neighbor has begun to repair the capital in his apartment, and since then Dmitrís from the ceiling of dress and there is no certainty that staying in the apartment is safe.
The problem is that my neighbors carried out voluntary construction and my apartment was damaged.
Then I informed the Riga Building Board, the Home Manager and other organizations.
The Board of Directors said that we are not an operational service and that we are not an expert.
"The owner of the apartment must go to the Latvian Engineering Union, and there will be an expert from there," Dmitrijs says.
The requested expert has arrived, identified the incident and acknowledged that the overriding situation is unsatisfying.
However, since Dmitria’s first application in the construction department, it has been a month, and by the beginning of this week, no one has been able to answer whether the apartment is in danger of life.
The government said - there is legislation, wait if you are not satisfied, write to everyone in order.
"Then I wrote to the Riga House, but they sent the house manager, then the house manager went back to the building, and then there was a road," Dmitrijs says.
After all of the paperwork, it is clear that the construction work is stopped, although it can be heard at any time that someone is working there.
For another two months, the owner of the apartment who does the repair work must be expert and all these defects must be prevented within six months.
The independent expert has drawn up his opinion, but the construction board considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal structure in this non-existent structure has been affected, and therefore there is no doubt that the owner of the lower apartment is in danger.
"That is why we have requested further clarification from this expert," says Ilze Zuka, representative of the city of Riga.
Despite the ban on any repair work in the upper apartment, we always hear that the building will continue.
The penalty for voluntary construction without a building permit is EUR 70 to 700, but in this case the penalty may be more severe.
While the expert opinion is expected, the Board of Directors has decided that both apartments must not be operated - both in the construction and Dmitry's apartment.
"This was not the case in the construction practice when, because of their ignorance or simply inadvertentness, the citizens may have created a threat not only to their property but also to the owner of the underlying property, as a result of which the owner cannot operate his property," said the representative of the construction company.
Now Dmitri is left to find another place where to live - with relatives, friends, hotels, or rent another apartment.
But the losses that Dmitry has suffered can try to get away from the neighbor's civil order, which can take a lot of time.
For the sake of voluntary construction, both apartments are now prohibited until the construction engineer has reached its conclusion, and it can be expected for up to three weeks.
The damage will have to be borne by the owner of the apartment where the repair work has been carried out.
The owner of this apartment is also threatened by a prison sentence for up to six months because the construction board has not taken into account.
Oh, come on!
What's the praise in this picture?
The correct answer is five.

The conversion of the former Kemer sanatorium into a primordial hotel will cost 22 million euros.
The conversion of the former Kemeri sanatorium into a five-year hotel Park Hotel Kemeri will cost 22 million euros, and the agency LETA is the representative of Gita Želve, SIA Park Hotel Kemeri, the manager of the boiling hotel.
The establishment of the hotel is the first phase of the restoration of the former Kemeru sanatorium.
The second stage will be "wellness" or a well-being clinic, which is planned to open in 2022, while the opening of the hotel is scheduled in May 2018.
Zelve notes that the exact costs of the clinic are not yet known.
However, she points out that it will be found in the former Čemer resort polyclinic building, with an area of about 12,000 square meters.
The clinic will be located on three floors.
The Park Hotel Čemeri and the proposed clinic owner are the international fund "G Capital Europe", which invests in European assets.
The owners of "G Capital Europe" are several investors who invest money in this fund, Želve points out.
As Managing Director George Jones said earlier, the creation of a former resort polyclinic is planned to invest between EUR 12 and 15 million, with a total investment of more than EUR 30 million.
It has already been announced that the restoration of the cultural historic park in more than 42 hectares of the area, the restoration of roads and streets, the construction of an interactive natural tourism facility, the improvement of the area and the construction of parking spaces on the Emelia Park, which will contribute to the socio-economic development of the city of Jurmala and the increase in the number of tourists, the Jürmala Council plans to attract EUR 14.5 million from the European Union funds, co-financing with between EUR three and EUR four million.
By mid-2017, design works will begin in the autumn of the following year.
As reported, in the historic Sanatorium complex Čemeri is planned to form a five-star hotel park Hotel Čemeri and wellness, or a well-being clinic.
However, the reconstruction is delayed.
On the other hand, the 2010 review also stated that "Ominasis" was regularly communicating with the hotel operator "Kempinski", which continues to provide daily technical control at the "Kemeri" sanatorium, and in 2011 it was determined to meet the "complete reconstruction of the boiling "Keminski" hotel and to start preparing for the opening of the "Keminski" chain hotel.
In October 2014, the Čemeri Park Hotel confirmed its readiness to purchase the indemnity of Ominasis Latvia, which is owned by Ominasis Latvia, but the month later the award was recognised as a failure because the winner had not paid for the purchase in due time.
The sales price was determined at the beginning of the last auction - EUR 2.86 million.
As the agency LETA informed the city council representative Ieva Aile, the municipality, in signing the protocol, has confirmed that, with the support of the co-financing of the European Union Structural Funds, the infrastructure that will be in place in the structures - the refurbishment of the historic Kimer Park, will create an interactive natural tourism facility, roads and parking facilities.

He studied at the Vocal Department of the Latvian Academy of Music in the Class of Arvida Luste.
On the other hand, in 1997 he began singing the Latvian National Opera, but in 1998 he debuted with the role of Oberto in the opera "Alčina".
He was awarded the "Great Music Award 2003" for vocal performances in opera shows and Verdi's board.

A year later, Antonenko played Otello’s role in the London Koventgarden opera.
The Russian hackers broke up by former NATO Commander Bridlow's e-mail.
Hackers who hacked the U.S. National Democratic Committee (DNC) computers, possibly having made several other cyber attacks, also hacked the servers of the former NATO European Force Commander Philip Brydlov e-mail and George Soros Institute of Open Society, Bloomberg announced on Thursday the business news agency.
Hackers have published information on DCLeaks.com.
Among other things, there is also a list and information on the work of the Soros Institute.
For hackers, the Institute's computers have been available for a whole year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyber attacks were carried out by the same hackers associated with Russian expeditions who broke the DNC e-mails.
The Wall Street Journal, on the other hand, reports that the U.S. President Barack Obama's administration is currently examining the issue of setting new sanctions for Russia, thus responding to the breakdown of DNC computers.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration will have to accuse the servers of Russia or the Russian authorities of being officially attacked in cybercrime.
As reported, the WikiLeaks website published about 20,000 e-mails in July, which were obtained from the DNC computer system, and of which it is clear that the leaders of the Democratic Party have tried to harm the presidential election of the party candidate Hilaria Clinton, former Sanctian Senator of Vermont.
As reported by the US press sources, the Federal Investigation Office, which investigates the break-in of democratic servers and other US experts, considers that Russia’s link to cyber-attack is unquestionable.
Macartney: Yoko Ono's presence threatened "The Beatles".
Paul Macartney acknowledged that Yoko Ono's presence created a sense of the threat of the legendary group "The Beatles".
The 74-year-old rock star currently maintains a "good" relationship with John Lenon's absenteeism, but at the time she went to visit the group in her study, she feared Makartnia because Ono was the only woman in the group between George Harrison, Ringo Stara, Lenon and Makartnia.
When the singer asked about the two relationships, he told the Rolling Stone magazine, "That's really good."
At that time, we felt at risk.
While we registered, she sat on the amplifiers.
Most of the groups could not bear it.
We were able to do this, but not quite successfully, because we were very tight.
We weren't sexists, but the girls usually didn't come to a record study, and they let us work.
When John began to meet Yoko, she did not sit in the control room but in the middle of the four of us.
The author of Yellow Submarine also admitted that he now regularly contacted the former band member Ringo, and every time, he confirmed the work plans of the record study "Apple" but otherwise "The Beatles" is "end of work".
The question is whether he is still meeting with the only other living member of the legendary handcuff, Makartney told the Rolling Stone magazine: "Of course not."
We meet in social events and dances.
However, I did not go to the meetings, and I felt somewhat limited.
I left Apple in the middle of a big divorce.
In my place at the meetings, I sent John Rightman and said, "Tell me what everyone says, because I can't stand sitting on that table."
It was too painful to see our pet die.
The company now works so that I'll just listen to all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus was once a habitable planet
Based on NASA's latest climate models, Venus has once been a viable planet.
NASA Godard Space Research Institute scientists have developed a model to explore Venus history using tools and algorithms that climate scientists also use.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, whose surface is hot, water is not, and whose atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon, when conditions similar to Earth have ever been.
Scientists have already mentioned earlier that Venus’s slow rotation rate is explained by a dense atmosphere.
However, recent simulations show that Venus once had a plane, an atmosphere similar to the Earth, and it would slowly collapse.
The model also looks at Venus’s oldest topography.
There was more dry area on the planet than on Earth, but there was plenty of water and geographical diversity on it so that life could be created and water would not be evaporated.
In the early days of Venus, the sun was more than 30 percent faster.
In the simulation of the GISS model, the Venus rotation model reveals that the light part of the day on it lasts for 2 months, explained in the press release by the GISS scientist Antonijs Del Genio.
This process warms the surface of the planet and causes a thing that, in turn, forms thick clouds that act as a cloud guard to protect the planet from the heat of the sun.
The result is a moderate climate temperature, which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model depicts the history of Venus, which is similar to the theory of evolution that scientists have developed in their hypothesis.
Although it was once inhabited, for billions of years Venus has been subjected to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
They were burned by the oceans, and their lungs were burned by ultraviolet stars.
When the water was completely drained, the steam left only a flat carbon atmosphere with a deadly greenhouse gas - Venus, which we know today.
Scientists published the results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roys departs from the work of Coach Avalanche
On Thursday, Colorado 'Avalanche' coach and hockey operations Vice-President Patrick Roys presented a request, as a reason for not having enough impact on the team's decision-making process.
The Colorado Vice-President and General Joe Sakiks confirmed this news and informed that the club was about to start looking for a new coach immediately.
"In the last three years, I've been energetic, exciting and targeted as the main coach and vice-president of the Colorado Club hockey operations," Rojs, 50 years old, writes in his report.
During this summer I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve the performance of the team in order to give it the required height and achieve a higher level of results.
In order to achieve this, the visions of the vice-president of the main coach and hockey operations must be fully in line with the visions of the organisation.
It must also be able to influence decisions relating to the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakik, who was serving on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Sakiks said Patrick informed her about his decision today.
We appreciate all that he has done for the organization and want it to be better for him further.
In his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014, Roy was recognised as the best coach in the league and received the Jack Adams Award.
He helped the club to reach 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but the first round of the exclusion games, Colorado team won the Minesota hockey player. Since then, the club has not been involved in the exclusion games for two years.
Avalanche closed the 2015-2016 season with results 39-39-4 and left five points behind the Wild team without obtaining a second special invitation from the Western Conference organizers.
The guard of the famous medicine, Roy, in his career, fought four Stanley battles - two with the Montreal "Canadian" and two with the "Avalanche".
North Sea oil platform workers resume negotiations and leave the strike
The workers' strike on the North Sea oil platforms has been delayed because the negotiations between the parties to the dispute have been resumed, the heads of the mail negotiations.
On a periodic basis against the oil processing company "Wood Group" there are strikes on the North Sea oil platforms where the company "Royal Dutch Shell" operates.
The Joint Communication states that the trade unions Wood Group and Unit and RMT agreed to resume negotiations on resolving the dispute.
Several full days of meetings are scheduled for the following week, which will begin at the beginning of the week with a view to re-examineing the problematic issues.
The trade unions reported that their recent measures, organised after more than 25 years of interruption, were aimed at 30% of the planned reduction in wages.
This year, due to negative market pressure, the Wood Group has reduced the wages of 9 percent of North Sea workers.
Already in 2014, the company reduced the wages of land workers by 10 per cent.
The company explains that additional wage reductions would allow the company to survive a market downturn.
On the other hand, Shell has already reduced the wages of several thousand people and announced plans to stop oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries to optimize its work by preparing a large-scale merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies feel pressured by the rising oil prices, and the situation is becoming increasingly difficult for Britain to abandon the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, Mr Davis Anderson, Member of the Scottish Parliament, met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - North Sea strike plans.
He said that the North Sea is vital to the economy of the region.
In his report, he explained that the North Sea and the State in general needed an economy from which everyone, not individuals, would benefit.
In 2016, the new North Sea projects are expected to invest almost $1.4 billion compared with the $7 billion invested over the last five years.
Kepler measures the speed of star rotation in the Pleiades star.
The latest Kepler telescope mission has helped astronomers gather the most complete catalog of the speed of the star rotation in the Pleiades Star.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why stars in this star range at different speeds, and how the star rotation rate applies to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will get more information about the relationship between the mass of stars, age and even the history of the solar system," said Professor Luis Rebula of the Pasadenas Caltech Infrared Process and Analytical Centre.
The flash star is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many stars in this star are just beginning to grow, reaching the age of about 125 million years.
They're cutting at the maximum speed.
At the maximum speed, these growing stars emit large amounts of star wind.
When the winds arrive in the magnetic field, they brake the stars.
As the stars get older, their speed decreases.
Kepler measures the speed of each star's rotation by setting the time between a known star area, such as the solar plane.
The latest catalogue of star rotations shows that larger stars are bending slower than smaller stars.
Rebuls compare stars to dancers, larger growth sensors perform pyrites less slowly than small growth sensors.
Rebul says that the Pleiades' "ballet" is seen as slowly rotating objects are larger and larger, whereas faster rotating objects are very small stars.
Thanks to the closeness of the Pleiades star, it serves as a great space laboratory, where it can compare the characteristics of the stars to the speeds of rotation.
Rebul says that the Pleiades Star helps create theoretical models for the rotation of stars in both parent and younger stars.
We still need to learn a lot about how, when and why the speed of star rotation slows and about their complete stopping process.
Rebuls and his colleagues detailed the analysis of the speed of the Pleiades star rotation in three new publications, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
