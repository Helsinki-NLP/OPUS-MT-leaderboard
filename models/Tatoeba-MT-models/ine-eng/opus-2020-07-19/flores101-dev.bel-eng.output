The stars emit heat and light thanks to energy, which is produced when atoms of hydrogen merge (or merge), resulting in more difficult elements.
At present, scientists have been working on developing a reactor that would be able to produce energy in a similar way.
But it's a very difficult task, and it's going to go on for many years before they're built up suitable for the operation of a thermal synthesis reactor.
Due to the superficial strain, the steel needle can swim on the surface of the water.
The surface pressure rises, for the molecules of water that are on its surface are strongly attracted to one another, and the force of attraction between them is greater than the attraction to the molecule of air above.
The molecules of the water form on her surface an invisible skin, thanks to what things, such as the needle, can hold on to the blue.
On the modern edge of the forest is a double layer with a marked field between the edges. This ensures better contact with the ice, even if the edge is below the angle.
The lower part of the lasa eased away, so when the lasail is bent, it also fades away and its edge, which touches to the ice.
With this shape, you turn around. When you turn right, the shape rotates to the right. When you turn left, it turns left.
To get back the previous level of energy, they need to get rid of the energy leaves from the light.
For this, they release a tiny piece of light called "fondon."
The scientific name of this process is "inducted emission of radiation," because light stimulates atoms, is emitted by light, and light is one of the types of radiation.
You can see at the bottom of the image atoms that form the protons, and in fact, the electrons are much smaller than the one in the image.
The size of the Fotons is even smaller than in part that goes into the atoms!
The net lamp burns after a hundred hours of work and the lamp ceases to shine.
In this case, the lamp needs to be changed. You must be careful when replacing it.
You must first turn off the light device or turn off the cable.
Electricity, which goes into a cartridge where the metal part of the lamp is located, can cause a strong loss of the electric current if you, while the lamp is in the cartridge, reach the inner part of the cartridge or the metal base of the lamp.
The heart pumps blood and is the main organ of the blood system.
In the heart of the blood, the vessels known as arteries, and in the heart, the vessels known as veins, the smaller vessels are called capillaries.
Even very hard branches and roots (and not just leaves) were no problem for the teeth of the triceratops.
According to some scientists, a triceratops could eat herbs — a type of plants that were widely distributed during the melodious period.
These plants look like little palm trees with a crowned flagged flag.
Before eating the bowl, the tricerataps could break the leaves with their powerful fat.
At the same time, other scientists say that these plants are very toxic, so it's unlikely that dinosaurs will eat them, and this is despite the fact that in our time, the crustaceans and other animals, such as parrots (and it comes from dinosaurs).
How will I activate the gravity of Io? Your weight on the surface of Io would be less than on earth.
A man in 200 pounds (or 90 kg) of weight on Earth on Io is going to weigh about 36 pounds (or 16 kg).
Unlike the Earth, the sun has no solid surface on which to stand. The sun is completely composed of fire, gases, and plasmas.
Gas becomes more and more dissipated as far away from the center of the sun.
The outer part of the sun, which we watch, is a photograph or in the translation of the "shadow of light."
In 1610, almost three thousand years later, watching a telescope behind Venus allowed an Italian astronaut, Galileo, to see that she too has phases as well as the Moon.
Only the side of Venus (or the Moon) that has returned to the Sun has been highlighted for this reason, the phase of Venus has changed. The phases of Venus have been evidenced by the theory of Kapernik, which claimed that the planets revolve around the Sun.
In 1639, a few years later, an astronaut from England, Jeremy Horax, monitored the passage of Venus to the sun.

After the battle for France ended, Germany began preparing for the conquest of Great Britain.
Germany marked an attack by a code called Operation "The Marine Cat". Most of the heavy weapons and stocks of the British Army were lost during the evacuation from Dünker, which weakened the army.
But still the power of the Queen's fleet was much more than in Germany's WMS (which in German is called "Krigsmarine": it could destroy any attacking fleet that was headed through La-Mansh.
At the same time, close to the likely routes of invasion, very few of the ships of the Queen's fleet were built, because the admirals feared their warming by the German air force.
Let's start with the Italian plan, which was "younger brothers" in Japan and Germany.
Despite the fact that before the very beginning of the war four new ships were built, her armies and fleet were weaker.
The African countries were Italy's main target, and they needed an initial plot to capture these countries, with which troops could cross the Mediterranean and attack Africa.
To that end, they needed to get rid of the British bases and ships that were in Egypt, and nothing else but this Italian liner ship had to do.
And as for Japan, as for Great Britain, Japan was an island country.
The submarines are the ships that were specially designed to move under the water. They can be under the water for a long time.
The submarines were used both for the First and for the Second World Wars, while they were moving very slowly, and the distance of the arrows was quite small.
When the war only began, they swam, mainly, on the surface of the sea. However, because the radars were perfect and made more accurate, underwater boats had to descend under the water to avoid being noticed.
German submarines were called "U-Bot". Germans had excellent navigation and control skills with underwater boats.
After the war Germany did not allow a lot of underwater boats because of their successful use.
One of the most well-known in our time is Pharaoh Tutanhamen, sometimes called Pharaoh Here or Pharaoh Boy.

There are different opinions on how many people talk in Hindi, and on different counts, the language is one of the first places in the world (between the second and the fourth) by the number of people who speak in it.
There are different estimates of the number of media in this language, depending on whether the relative dialects are counted.
The total number of media in this world is estimated from 340 to 500 million, and another 800 million people can understand it.
In Hindi and Urdu there is a similar vacabulary, but different writing; the media of both languages in round-the-clock conversations usually understand each other.
Somewhere in the 15th century, Germany had a significant impact on the culture of northern Estonia.

To learn how to create an interactive environment, you need to have both traditional skills and those that have been acquired in interactive activities (including the creation of coding, editing and editing audio and video equipment, recording of messages, etc.)
Interactive modelling requires you to review your presentations on media preparation and to learn non-linear thinking.
For interactive design, it took not only to connect the components, but also to make sense.
Objects with a variable focus distance have a specific disadvantage — compared to simple objects, the focus complexity and the number of objects that are needed to reach a certain area of focus distance is much larger.
The problem disappears because lens manufacturers achieve increasingly high standards in their products.
Thanks to this quality of the photographs that could be made using such zoom-objects, we could compare them to the quality of the photograph that was made by the object with the fixed focus distance.
As a rule, the smallest maximal diagram (speed) of the object is another flaw of the zoom-objects.
For this reason, it's difficult to use the hummingbirds without a flash when the light is small.
The range on the screen is one of the most common problems with converting movies to a DVD.
The design of the main mass of television is designed in such a way that it looks as many people as possible.
As a result, there are always borders on the television screen — top, bottom, and sides.
This is used to ensure that the screen saver is fully re-secured. A screen saver has the name "field".
It's not sad, but if you're making a DVD, the borders of the image, rather than everything else, will also be crossed. So the subtitles can only be seen partially if they are too close to the bottom of the screen.
Classic medieval castles long ago gave space for fantasy -- they produced images of knights' food, banquets, and forced to remember the legends of King Arthur.

The goal of believers is to gain practical experience, develop spiritual vision, or understand the essence of divine reality or the essence of wish.
Followers have a way of life or are engaged in appropriate practices to enrich their own experience of this kind.
The difference between mysticism and other religious beliefs and cultures is that mysticism focuses on the direct personal survival of the unique state of consciousness, in particular, when it bears a peaceful, transparent, noble or even aesthetic character.
Sickism is a religion that comes from the Indian subcontinent, which was born in the 15th century in the Punjab region as a result of the rise in the Hinduism of various sectarian groups.
Despite the recognition of the Sikhs of Hindu roots and the traditions of Sikhism, they still believe that their faith and Hinduism are distinct religions.
The Sikhs are called the Gurms religion, which in the Phanjabi language means the "paths of the game". In all Indian religions, the concept of the game is central and has great significance, but in Sikhsism has become so important that it is the main component of the Sikhs' beliefs.
In the 15th century, the founder of religion became the Gourmet of Nanak (1469–1539), followed by another nine gourmets.

Indian civilisation is a civilisation of the Bronze Age. The area of the said civilisation was located in the north-east of the Indian subcontinent. The area of the above-mentioned area was a large part of the territory of modern Pakistan, as well as other regions in the north-east of Afghanistan and the north-west of India.
The civilization in question has achieved prosperity in the Indus Basin. This is where its name comes from.
In view of the fact that this civilization also existed in the pools of the highest cancers of Saraswati, some scientists believe that it should be properly called the Indus-Saswitz civilization, while others call it the Harrap civilization in honour of the city of Harap, the first excavations that began in the 1920s.
The achievement of medicine was greatly encouraged by the fact that the Roman Empire was a military state.
Emperor August was the first to hire doctors to serve, and he even created the first Roman medical corps to provide medical assistance to those who would suffer in future battles.
The surgeon is known to be all sorts of diseased means, including the number of marphines that are obtained from the extract of the seed of the poppy, and the spalamin from the extract of the seed of the blocket.
To save the patients from the gorilla, they learned to do amputation, and to stop the bleeding, to put on joints and blood pressure.

Attention deficit syndrome is "a neurological syndrome, three classic manifestations of which are pathological detachivity, impulse, and other energy (or hyperactivity)".
It's a disorder of cognitive ability, not a lack of learning; it's "counted in 3-5 percent of children, it's about 2 million of all children in America."
Children with a deficit syndrome are hard to focus on, for example, school tasks, but they are able to focus on things they like.
Considering that the brains of these children cannot be stimulated by normal methods, they "participate in risky behaviors, engage in battles and challenge governments," which leads to a large number of problems.
The deficit syndrome has an impact on the relationship with the equations, because other children can't understand why those who suffer from AIDS act and write in a proper way, or why they have another level of stamina.
The basic speed of knowledge has changed as a result of the above-mentioned change in the ability to acquire knowledge and learn.
The other was an accessory to get information. There was no longer a requirement for individual memory tests, but more attention was paid to the ability to memorize the text.
In fact, the approach to learning and extension of knowledge has changed considerably in the Age of Birth.
Haminides no longer use their hands to move, carry heavy loads, and drop on trees — unlike other specimens.
The size and length of the hand and the foot of the chimpanzee are similar to that of the hands when moving with the handle to carry the load.
A man's hand is not as long as a foot, and the phalanx upon it more straight.
About this transition to work from moving objects to performing the operation to testify the excavated bones of hands grew from two to three million years old.
Some people think that a lot of artificially called conscious dreams can partially deplete.
This phenomenon is mainly explained by the fact that with conscious dreams increases the period between fast sleep phases.
If you have less sleep during the night, the state you're really sleeping in, and your body is recovering, it's getting less frequent, and it's a problem.
It's not less tired than waking up every twenty or thirty minutes to look at something on TV.
The effect affects the frequency with which your brain is trying to see conscious dreams over the night.
Nearly the Italians in North Africa were not given a start. After the announcement of the Italian war on 10 June 1940, the 11th U.S. Army captured the left-wing Capucci for a week.
The British organized a crew east of Bardi and captured General Lastucci, who was the leader of the ten-armed Italian army.
The Governor-General of Libya and the apparent successor of Musalini, Lieutenant Ital Balbo, died during the landing in Tobruk under the assembling of his troops, which took place on 28 June.

In this kind of sport, it's mostly a duel: one fettovalist is partnering with another.
Golf is a game where players kill balls in holes using special keys.
The game usually starts with the first and ends with the eighteenth in the field.
A victory will get the golfer who needs to do the least hits or swings with the key to go through the whole field.
This game is passing through a field with a grassy cover. The grasses around the holes are cut short, and this place is called the green.
The most popular of tourism is probably holiday tourism, which is what the vast majority of people associate with travel.
It's just at this point that people are sent to rest and cheer up in a place that has nothing in common with their everyday life.
Most of all tourists who want to relax and rest a little, visit standard places like beaches, parks of attractions and campsites.
If a person, visiting a particular place, has the goal of studying his or her history and culture, it's cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different places and attractions of one particular country, or pay special attention to only one region or region.
Looking at everything that's going on, the colonists also called for a reinforcement.
New Hampshire's 1st and 3rd battalions were put into the military, which ensured that there were a security of hand-held positions, and each battalion had 200 people, and they were ordered by Colonels John Stark and James Red, who later became generals.
The people of Stark moved from the north side of the colonists' positions along the coast.
After the cut opened up access to the break along the Mystic Canal on the north-east coast of the peninsula, they resorted to the aisle, building a short stone wall, which continued and ended on a small beach near the edge of the water.
At a distance of about 100 feet (30 meters) from the Baroness of Greely or Stark, they set six and suggested that no one shoot until regular troops pass it.
Co-ordinated attacks on three different sides were part of the American plan.
In order to prevent the suspension of the siege, General John Qadwalder went to the British garrison in Bordington.
Going through cancer in Trenton-Fary, 700 A.D., General James Yuing seized the bridge through Asunink-Crick and refused to allow the enemy army to flee.
The main hit group, in which 2,400 people entered, was to be nine miles north of Trentan to go through cancer, then split into two groups under the command of Sullivan and Green, and then attack the guard before dawn.
When you move from a distance in a quarter of a mile to a half a mile of speed loses its importance, so the absolute necessity becomes durability.
Of course, the first class running at half must not only have sufficient speed to run away less than two minutes, but also to maintain endurance and endurance at any risk.
The best preparation for the new runaway season is the cross across the intersection with the exercises for the upper part of the body in the sports hall.
Only proper nutrition does not guarantee high performance, but it can significantly improve the health of young athletes across the board.
To improve your indicators, to get more fun from sports sports to help maintain a good energy balance, effective recovery habits, and understanding various aspects of food supplements.
Runs in the middle of a distance, relatively low on sports. At least there are many wrong opinions about the sports inventory that you need to be involved in the cooperatives.
Things can be bought if they need to, but they mostly don't influence the outcome or this impact will be almost insensitive.
The athletes can take advantage of any product, even if it's not really worth it.
It could be thought that atom is one of the fundamental building blocks that make up all the matter.
Atom is a fairly complex object. Its center is in a simple Borrow model, where the electrons are orbited. The last thing is that the planets are orbiting around the Sun. (See Figure 1.1.)
Two particles form a nucleus — protons and neutrons.
While the neutrons have no charge, the protons have an additional electrical charge. The electrical charge of the electrons is negative.
First you need to study the site thoroughly to make sure you're in your own safety, and then just look at the patient.
When approaching the victim, you need to pay attention to its layout and the presence of suspicious signals.
If you get hurt when you give help, it can only make things more complicated.
As a result of the study, it was determined that fear, depression, and catastrophe were related to the pain and disability of patients suffering from pain in the lower back.
It's not depression and fear, but it's catastrophic and it's consequences that have confused regular weekly structured sessions across the PA.
People involved in physical exercise on a regular basis needed much support for the negative perception of pain in order to learn to distinguish the food pain from discomfort that is common to practice.
The vision or the ability to see affects the sensory organs of the visual system, or, in other words, the eyes.
There's a large number of different structures of the eye that are different from their complexity, which is all about the demands of the organization.
For different structures, different options, different levels of the layer and sensitivity to different wavelengths are typical. Moreover, for analysis of input data, different processing methods and different options are foreseen to ensure optimal operation.
The population is a society of some particular species, which exists inside a distinct geographical region.
If all the population has the same phenotypic characteristics, they're called monomorphic.
People are polymorphic in that they have different variants of some kind.
The same way, walkers and the nesting of a flock of ants are taking place at different stages.
As the wading ants move at night, and the day breaks for rest.
A run-in phase in the column starts when the available food is reduced. This phase of the column is made up of temporary nests and changes them every day.
Each of these hikes or marches continues for about 17 days.
What's a cell? It's the only word it takes to start with a Latin 'cell', which means 'small space'. It was first introduced into the microscripts that studied the structure of the woodwork.
The cell is the main element of all living things, and they all consist of one cell or more of them.
To study the life of cells, cells have a basic and so much value that they are rarely called 'the building materials of life'.
By sending nerve impulses all over the organization, the nervous system ensures that the blood vessel is safe and thus supports the chemo.
Nervous impulses help the organism to avoid any possible danger, thanks to the very fast transmission.
Compared with other strong storms, the tarnads are floating on a small plot, but they are able to destroy everything literally on their way.
Tornado breaks down trees with roots, rips them out of the shells and adverts, and lifts them up into the sky. Two percent of the most destructive plants can withstand more than three hours.
The wind speed in these terrible storms is 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 miles per hour).
The larger lenses were made and used by people for thousands of years.
The last full-time telescopes, however, appeared in Europe only under the cover of the 16th century.
In such telescopes, two lenses were used to zoom in, zoom in and look at distant objects.
Mankind will always be eager and selfish, and the nature of co-operation is that if most people benefit from anything, the short-term perspective can always get more benefits when they act exclusively in their own interests.
It's just to hope that people in the majority of their own minds will know that co-operation is the best option in the long term perspective.
Many people dream that the day will come when people will be able to go straight to other stars and study the second dimension, and some people ask the question that there are, some believe in alien life or alien life on other planets.
However, if it really happens at any time, it's probably not very short, and stars are at such a great distance one of the two that even between the "neighbors" are a thousand miles away.
Perhaps your ancestors will someday consider their ancient ancestors standing somewhere at the top of the alien world?
Organisms of animals are a set of trillions of cells, they're powered by various things that are going wrong inside them.
Only in the animal there is a brain (although not in all; yes, for example, the medules do not have it).
You can meet animals in any corner of the planet, and they crash into the earth, swim in the water, and fly in the air.
The cell represents the smallest functional and structural unit of any living organism.
The word "cell" is derived from a Latin cell, i. e. a "small room".
You'll see that living creatures are made up of small squares or spheres if you try to look at them under the microscope.
Using a microscope, Robert Sound, an English biologist, saw a small square in the skin.
Huk was the first person to be able to see dead cells.
Connections and non-changeable elements can be moved from one state to another.
And nitrogen gas and nitrogen nitrogen have the same properties, and moisture is more dense, but it's the same molecules.
Another example is water. Water is made into two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.
Even when it goes into a gas-like, wet or solid state, it keeps the same molecular structure.
Its chemical state remains unchanged even when the physical state changes.
Time always surrounds us and affects all our actions, and despite that, it's hard to understand.
In fact, religion, philosophy, and science have studied time for thousands of years.
In our view, time is a series of events that are now happening in the past from the beginning.
Besides, time is what we're comparing the duration of the event.
Looking at the recurrence of a cycle event, you can manually set the time interval. A cycle event is a recurring event.
Computers can now be used to process photographs and videos.
A complex animation that is often used in television and movies is created with the help of computers.
Complex computers are often used when recording music for processing and mixing sounds.
For a long time in the 19th and 20th centuries, the idea was that sailors were the first residents of New Zealand, and they hunted big birds known as mine.
A theory was born later, which claimed that if the people of the sea sailed from Polynesia to the Great Fleet, the people of the seamen from New Zealand were forced to create on this land an agrarian society.
However, when they believed in the new data, the sailors were a group of sailors with the "great land" that landed on the island of Chatham from New Zealand, and they developed their own unique peaceful culture.
Another tribe settled the island of Chatham, and it was the seas of New Zealand that moved here.
“Mariores” – so they called themselves, there were several clashes, but at the end of the mario, they were destroyed.
People who have been taking part in this work for decades have helped us to better understand our own preferences and affections and at the same time to honestly appreciate the complex moments and even the right ones.
Listening to people's stories about themselves, their families and the organizations they work in, we've got valuable information about the past and some people, thanks to which in the culture of the organization there have been changes in both good and bad.
Understandably, culture doesn't necessarily go close to understanding history, but it helps people to understand where they're going in the history of organization.
In the process of assessing the success and analysis of the failure of the participants, both individually and increasingly, the values of the organization, its mission and its moving force are being deepened.
In this case, people were open to change and new direction of the local church's activities, because they remembered the previous entrepreneurship and success.
These success stories have helped to reduce the fear of change and have created positive thinking for future changes.
The overall idea is to solve the problem and to find solutions in different fields and using different ideas.
This type of thinking is characterized by speed, logic, accuracy, recognition of facts, re-use of existing methods and data collections.
The most important feature of this kind of thinking is that the right answer can be only one. There are only two answers that are correct and wrong.
This kind of thinking is most often found in people, the sphere of activity that is related to certain scientific or standard processes or procedures.
The logical idea is that for people with this type of thinking, they can remember the intentions, solve their problems, and conduct scientific research.
There's no doubt that people have been more successful in "reading thoughts" other than the second species.
This means that we can successfully predict the feelings, intentions, hopes, knowledge and desires of other people.
The most important of these abilities is understanding the intentions of others, because it allows us to rule out any potential inconsistencies in the event of physical action.
Yes, if you have to see how someone breaks the gun in the car, you're going to decide more quickly that this person is trying to steal something from the car.
However, if he lost the keys to his car and tried to hit his own car, your guess wouldn't be true.
MRT is a technology based on a physical phenomenon known as a nuclear-magnetic resonance (AMR), which was discovered by Felix Bloch (Stenford University) and Edward Persell (Gardard University) in the 1930s.
The magnetic field and the radiation waves cause atoms to generate weak radio signals during this resonance.
In 1970, Raymond Domandjiang, a doctor of medicine, a scientist and a researcher, realized how to use a magnetic-resonant tomography in medicine for diagnosis of disease.
Four years later, the first patent in the world was issued in an MRT branch.
Dr. Damadjian completed the construction of the first MDM scanner “for the whole body” in 1977.
Asynchronous interaction requires more time for synthesis and reaction.
This enables students to work at their own time and also to control the speed of entry and processing of scientific information.
In addition, this method predicts a smaller number of time constraints, and allows you to work on a flexible graph (Bremer, 1998)
Thanks to the Internet and the World Training School, students can search or get information at any time.
In addition, instead of waiting for the next personal meeting, students can ask their teachers questions at any time — and in most cases they get a pretty quick answer.
Postmodern approach to the adoption of new knowledge implies freedom from absolute principles, bans and values, and there is no good way to learn anything.
In fact, there is a large number of things you need to study.
This is confirmed by our existing experience of interacting with all the educational television shows with the category "Do alone" and the information programs.

As has already been noted, despite the fact that in the United States the word eskimos remains prime, many Arctic nations outside the United States (especially Canada) consider it inferior.
Although the word is mentioned and used among the indigenous population of Greenland, it is not welcomed by foreigners.
In Canada, the Korean inhabitants of Greenland are called inuits, and in Greenland, they are called 'colleagues' (corresponding to the multiple of 'collates').
Crimes and hostility to the address of aliens in the whole -- a phenomenon that's practically not going to meet in Greenland -- there's no safe criminal areas even in the city.
The only real danger that an unprepared person can face is the cold weather.
If you're going to visit Greenland in a cold couple of years, you need to take enough warm clothes (as far as you're going north as you're going to be colder there).
Because in summer there are very long days, problems with sleep deficits can arise, as well as other health problems.
In summer, we also need to remember the northern chambers, although they are not the carriers of the disease, but they can hit hard.

Handshake is in many regions of the world, a friendly gesture that means "hello."
In Malaysia, however, at least one of the Malians living in rural areas means "come here". This is a gesture that is similar to a gesture when a certain finger is lost in the direction of the body. The latter is used in some parts of the West and should be used only in this way.
