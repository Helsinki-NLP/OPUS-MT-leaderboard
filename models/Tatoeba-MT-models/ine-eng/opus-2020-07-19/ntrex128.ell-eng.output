Welcoming MPs are worried that they're going to be confused with the "mapet"
Some Members expressed concern about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of Parliament of the Netherlands).
This concern arose in relation to the plans to change the name of the Assembly of Parliament of Wales.
Members throughout the political spectrum are concerned that something like this will sound ridiculous.
A member of the Working Party said his resignation was concerned that "it would make a homologous with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: In the vowels, the word "twp" means "huge" and the word "pwp" means "twigs".
A Pleidic MP said that the overall extension was "not satisfied" and proposed alternative solutions.
A Green conservative stated that his extension was "open" about the change of name, but noted that the word MWP does not leave much of the word "mapet".
In this context, the verbal letter w is similar to the English word for Yorkshire in the letter u.
The parliamentary committee, which is currently drawing up the bill for the adoption of a change of name, said: "The final decision on any name by which Members will be called will naturally be the case of the Members themselves."
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the Parliament of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, which were widely accepted for the name of the Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the title of the Members, the Commission took the name "Member of the Parliament of Wales" or WMP, but the choice of MWP was the one that gained greater support during the public consultation.
Members obviously propose alternative options, but the attempt to reach consensus may be a difficult case for the President of Parliament, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the bill to change his name within the next few weeks.
The Law on Reforms will also include other changes in the way the House operates, including rules of derogation from the office of the Member and the design of the committee system.
Members will decide in the final vote on the question of their name during the legislative debate.
In the fields, the citizens of Macedonia come to the referendum on the change in the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday on the change of the country's name to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The people's vote was called upon in an effort to resolve a decade-long conflict with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens claims that the name of the neighboring north is subject to territorial shocks and has repeatedly been opposed to its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Georgie Ivanov, President of Macedonia, a war of referendum on the change of name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zeef, claim that the change is simply the price they have to pay for their EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's campaigns have been silenced as the churches in Harlem disappear.
"The older people I spoke to say that there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
Today, there's none of the two."
He said he understood the reason the bars disappeared.
"The world is socializing differently today," he said.
"The bar is no longer the neighborhood 's salon where the world is frequenting regularly."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the property will not remain as long as the officials hope "and will return sooner or later to the point where they started".
The churches, he added, can be replaced by numerous residential fillings with people who would not be willing to help the places of worship that have remained nearby.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and will therefore speed up the day when all these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that all these people who move to these apartments will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white churches prior to the birth of Harlem Metropolis Black - the Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The early Methodist Church left in the 1930 ’ s.
A black church in the vicinity took possession of the building.
The possession of St. Martin's building took up a black church under the famous John Howard Johnson, who went to the 125th Road boutiques, a major trade route in Charlemagne, which refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but Father Johnson's enorbitants took over the reconstruction and ordered the carione.
Pope David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin's church, proudly called the carriage "the campaigns of the poor".
The expert who played the cartoon in July described it in a somewhat different way: "political treasure" and "an alternative instrument of historical importance".
The expert, Tiffany In, from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first black-musiced carione in the world, Dionysius A. Lind, who was transferred to a larger carione in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merigueder said that St. Martin's church did not replace him.
What is happening in the last few months in St. Martin is a complicated story between architects and workers, some of whom were taken from the church's leaders, and others from the point of view.
The officials - the body of power, which is made up of the people's leaders - sent a letter to the Council in July about their concerns that the purpose "would be able to transfer the cost" to the body of the rights, despite the fact that this had no involvement in the acquisition of the architects and workers sent by the church.
Some enorigines have expressed concerns about lack of transparency on the part of the target.
Infestation of 13-year-old sharks in California
Cancer attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during the landings on the island of California on the first day of the summer season, according to the principles.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near the Bicon Beach beach in Ensinitis.
Chad Hamel on KSWB-TV told San Diego that he had sex with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child's cries for help and approached a team to get him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was just a cry of excitement because he got homeless, but then he realized he was calling, "Something hit me!
Something's touched me!"
His whole key had been opened," Hamel observed when he got to the place where the boy was.
"I called everyone out of the water: 'There's sharks in the sea!' said Hamel.
The boy was airied at the Randy Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is critical.
The species responsible for the attack remains unknown.
Mariner Larry Giles said in the type paper that the shark had been detected in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was considered not to belong to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim brings serious injuries to the upper part of the cortex.
The authorities banned access to the beach from Point Bis in Casemblad to Sumis in Ensinitis for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's projects exert pressure on the US retail market
The Sainsbury's are measured with the Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams by placing artificial reefs corresponding to those of the multi-storey, controlled by special staff.
In the context of the significant decline in the US retail market of £2.8 billion, which continues to develop while sales of clothing and household items show a drop, the largest retail stores will be tested at 11 stores throughout the country and spread to more stores if the operation succeeds.
The investment in the cosmetics sector is coming as supermarkets search for a way to refill the area on the reefs that once understood televisions, microwave ovens and domestic species.
The Sainsbury's said they would double the size of their cosmetics offer to 3,000 products, including companies such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In the existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees there will also be more space with the company's logo, like those stores like Boots.
The supermarket once again launches its own Boutique make-up series so that most products are vegan - something that the younger consumers demand more and more.
In addition, the fragrance company The Fragrance Shop will try to supply its products to two Sainsbury's shops, the one that opened in Croindon, South London, last week and the other in Shelly Oak, Bermiham, later this year.
The electronic markets and the market trend of small quantities of food per day in local mini-markets mean that supermarkets should make greater efforts to make the world visit them.
Mike Cooper, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that outlet stores would look more and more like multi-storey, as supermarket chains are trying to compete with Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more non-food services.
The Sainsbury's placed outlet Argos stores in hundreds of stores, while also imported certain Habitats as they bought both chains two years ago, a fact that supported the sales of goods and became more profitable on the markets.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reinstate the pharmaceutical and cosmetic parts was unsuccessful.
The Sainsbury's tried a partnership with the Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation ended after an argument on how to distribute the profits from the pharmaceutical shops in the supermarket of the chain.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury's sold the pharmaceutical company with 281 stores in Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, compared to £ 125 million, three years ago.
He said Lloyds would play his own role in the project, adding an extended range of luxury care companies, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four shops.
Paul Mills-Hex, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our reefs to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who will be available to offer advice.
The range of our companies has been designed to cover every need, while the attractive environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now a possible destination for the artists who question the traditional way of markets."
Peter Jones: The change after Holly Willoby's departure from the 11 million-£ agreement
The winner of the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, is crazy after the departure of the Holly Willoby TV from the 11 million-£ agreement with the lifestyle company that has to dedicate itself to the new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willobby doesn't have time for the clothing company and accessories True.
Their business was similar to Goop's Goop from Guineth Paltroo.
The 37-year-old exhibition "This Morning", announced in Instagram her decision to leave.
Holly Willoby replaced the leading player of the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, leaving their winning lifestyle business at the last moment, in order to dedicate himself to her new huge alliances with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became furious when the gold girl of the TV was admitted during a full-length conference on Tuesday at the central offices of his empire in Marlowa, in Bakighamsair, that because of the new symbols - up to £1.5 million - it would not have had enough time to be available in the company of certain types of clothing and accessories True.
The company was similar to the Goop of Guineth Piltrous and it seems to double the property of Willoby estimated to amount to £11 million.
After 37-year-old Willoby announced in Instagram that he was going to leave True, Jones flew out of Britain to some of his coastal dwellings.
According to one source, "Truly was far from Holly Willoby's top priorities.
It was its long-term future, its source of income for the next decades.
Her decision to leave surprised all those involved in the business.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the presentation.
There is a warehouse full of products in the central offices in Marlowo ready to be made available for sale."
Experts estimate that the departure of the exhibition "This Morning", which is among the most commercial brands in Britain, could cost millions in the company due to huge investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and household clothing, as well as further delays in its presentation.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Holly Willoby, the mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin's wife have kept close friendships with Jones and Tara Cap's wife for ten years.
Willoby founded True with Cap in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined March as president.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones keeps a 40 percent share in Baldwin's television company.
Willoby is going to become the main person in M&S campaigns and replace And McPartlin at the I'm A Celebrity show on ITV.
A source from Jones' close environment said last night, "We wouldn't want to comment on his professional affairs."
We were tough, and then we fell in love.
He was ridiculed for the criticism received from the media about a school that some would think was inappropriate for a president, as well as for his positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trab make so many concessions?
The Trab said silent, the style of the TV.
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting, since the first meeting in Singapore in June was welcomed by the Tribe as a major step towards the depuration of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ray Young-Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see any "anti-response" from the United States after North Korea's early disarmament.
On the contrary, he stressed that the US continues to apply sanctions aimed at exerting pressure.
The Trab kept a much more hopeful attitude in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We're almost at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
We have now built this excellent relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim gave positive results - ending the tests, releasing the hostages and returning the other American soldiers to their homes.
While supporting his unusual position in his statements about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to have a 'president' style, but instead of having 10,000 people sitting outside the room because they couldn't get in, we'd only have 200 people in here," the Trab said, showing the crowd in front of him.
tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia hit a whole island, leaving thousands dead in their passage
In the wake of the earthquake in Lobok, for example, it was announced that the assistance of foreign non-governmental organizations would not be required.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the population of Lobock was exposed, there was no national disaster, a necessary condition for the use of international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international help, so it is quite difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While Save the Children are preparing a team that will travel to Palus, it is not yet certain whether foreign staff can work on the spot.
Mr. Sutopo, a representative of the National Natural Disasters Service, said that the Indonesian authorities assessed the situation in Palo to see if international organisations could contribute assistance.
Given the seismic strains that often affect Indonesia, the country remains unprepared against the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Athens, the same does not happen on other motorways.
The apparent lack of an alarm sequence for tsunamis in Palus, even after warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of so many lives.
In the best case, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters are even more confusing to administrative care.
A large hospital that had stopped in Lobock for the care of the victims of the earthquake leads to Palus, but it will take at least three days to reach the location of the new destruction.
President Joco Wyndondo had at the centre of his election campaign the improvement of the organized infrastructures of Indonesia and provided easy money for the construction of roads and railways.
However, Mr Joco's lack of funding is getting worse before the re-election next year.
Mr Joco also accepts pressure from her persistent phantom tendencies in Indonesia, where the members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people lost their lives, and tens of thousands were expelled as groups of Christians and Muslims are fighting in the streets, using swords, toxins, and arrows, as well as other automaton weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sterizes Liverpool's Isolating Against Chelsea
Daniel Sterize saved Liverpool from a fight at the Premier League against Chelsea with a bullet on Saturday, 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sterj accepted everything from Sardan Sakiri about 27 meters away from Chelsea's end with his team losing with 1-0.
Hit the ball on his left and shoot at the back dock.
His effort was very high from the big area and ended up on the right in the grids.
The ball finally fell over Cape Arizapalaga and jumped to the ground and went into the grid.
"I was trying to take this position, get to the ball, and players like Sakiri always play as much forward as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible," Sterjs told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kande coming, I made a direct change, I didn't think much about it, and I made the suit."
Chelsea had the lead with 1-0 in the mid-year after the ball at 25 minutes from Belgian star Eden Azar.
The blue attacker gave all the takouni to Mateo Kovacs in this game, before giving a shot with a fake near the center of the platform and running on the side of Liverpool.
Kovacchis did one in the middle of the floor.
Then he gave him a deep bag, driving Asher to the big area.
Azar ran in front of the defendant and completed sending the ball to the rear dock with a left jacket in front of Alison Baker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight with Naples during the Champions League's 3rd season on Wednesday at St. San Paulo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will meet videoton at UEFA Europa League on Thursday 3 a.m. in London.
The tragic calculation of the deaths from tsunami in Indonesia is 832
The calculation of the deaths after the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia is 832, according to the declarations of the country's Natural Disaster Service, early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of the buildings that collapsed after the earthquake of 7.5 degrees that struck the area on Friday and created waves 6 meters high, the representative of the service, Sutopo Puro Nugroho said at a type interview.
The city of Palus, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the ruins of the ruined buildings.
Police picked up a 32-year-old suspect after murder of a woman with a knife.
A murder investigation began after the discovery of a woman's body in Birkenheid, in Merceiside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found in 7.55 B.C.E. with injuries from soldiers at Grayson Mouse in John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect for murder.
The police asked the locals who saw or heard anything to report it to the police.
Officer Brian Ohagan said, "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to call anyone in the neighborhood around John Street and see or hear something suspicious about communicating with us.
I would also like to address a call to anyone, especially the taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the planes from the Dashcam cameras to contact us as they may have their information that is vital to our research."
A police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found is the resident of Birkenheid and found inside a building.
This afternoon friends who think they can meet the woman came to the scene of the crime to ask questions about the location where she was found this morning.
The investigations are in progress as the police said they were in the process of informing the nearest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mouse, in his attempt to return to his apartment, was informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was silent when he found out what happened.
The tenants were informed that they might need to spend hours before they are allowed to return to their homes.
A police officer is taking a man to say that the whole area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman showed up with tears on the scene.
They kept saying, "It's scary."
At 2 a.m., two police vans were located through the police station and one outside.
Policemen were standing outside the corridor watching the apartment.
Anyone has any information is requested to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crimestoppers line at 0800 555 111 for Case 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's temple in Parliament is the last monument affected by the philosophy of "recording history"
His exorcism would be a poetic justice for the Taliban destruction of many of England's cultural and religious works by his imaginative court supporters.
However, Mr Cromwell has described Mr. Creek's proposal as "announcing" and "probably rewriting the story".
John Goldsmith, President of the Collogo Cromwell, said: "In this debate on the removal of the traps, it was inevitable that the shape of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Empire would not be targeted.
The iconocracy of England’s civil wars was not banned or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps a member of the Cromwell family was mistakenly sacrificed for the actions of Thomas’s origin in the past century.
The excellent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thornicroft is characteristic of his image in the 19th century and part of the story of a personality that many believe is worth a price.
Mr Gollzmit told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is still considered by many, perhaps more by the end of the 19th century in relation to today, as a parliamentary advocate against external pressure, in his case, of course the monarchy.
The fact that this is an absolutely accurate case is the subject of an open historical debate.
The only thing that is certain is that conflicts in the mid-17th century have shaped our nation's future development, and Cromwell is an unrecognizable personality that represents one side of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy and worthy."
Dog-killer injured dead Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in southwestern China, according to local news reports.
The man, whose name was only known as "Owan", was found with cut blood in a lake near a pighouse on the market in Lioupansui in Guitsuo province, South China announced Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farm official is preparing to make pigs vaccines on 30 May 2005 in Zing, China.
He was brought to travel with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and opened the door of a neighboring pighouse.
He said there was a large male pig in his mouth with blood.
The doctor's examination confirmed that the pig weighing 227 kg had injured the farmer fatally, according to his report.
"My cousin's feet were dead and broken," said the cousin, known as "Go", according to the Sunday news sheet by Guyang.
The security camera plans show Wyan to enter the market on Thursday at 4.40 p.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Wyan or his cousin.
A market manager said in the evening news sheet that the pig has been placed in a cage so as not to attack anyone else, while the police collected the evidence at the scene of the attack.
Wean's family and market authorities are going to negotiate some compensation for his death.
Although in Spain, cases of swine attacks in humans have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their village in Massachusetts, seriously hurting the man.
Ten years ago, a 295 - kilo [295 kg] pig threw a farmer in Wales over the tractor until the farmer's wife feared the animal to be removed.
After the incident in which a farmer from Oregon was separated from his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as "inflamed".
"They just have a game mood.
They're small, very weird creatures... they don't want to do anything wrong.
We should just show them the proper respect," he said.
The remains of the Rosa typhoon are going to bring extensive rainfalls in the South-West United States
According to the forecasts, Typhoon Rosa suffers as it moves above the coldest water masses of the northern coasts of Mexico.
However, Typhoon Rosa will bring floodwaters to the North of Mexico and the South-West America in the coming days.
The power of the winds of the pink typhoon reached 85 mph, forming a Category 1 typhoon at 5 p.m. East hour, on Sunday and found 385 miles south-west of Puda Euhenia, in Mexico.
Roza typhoon is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low pressure area has begun to form above the Pacific Ocean and to move east towards the Western Pacific. As the Rosa typhoon approaches the lower California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will bring tropical moisture to the north in the South American.
Roza typhoon will bring rainfalls of 25 million in areas of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity in combination with the area of low air pressure approaching will create extensive heavy rainfalls in the Southwest in the next few days.
Local, rains of 2.5 to 10 million will cause dangerous floods, floods and possible floods in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will lead to rainfall rates of about 5 to 7.5 percent per hour, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
5 to 10 million rains are expected per area in the Southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Floods are possible with a rapid deterioration of the phenomena due to the dispersal nature of tropical rainfalls.
It is recommended to avoid any movement by foot in the desert in view of the threat of tropical rainfall.
Strong rainfalls can turn the pharaohs into riverbeds, and the storms will cause local spores of air and ammo.
The low air pressure area will create some local strong rainfalls by site on the southern California coast.
A total rainfall rate of more than 1 percent is likely, which may cause small floods and insomnia in the streets.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
Certain fragmented tropical pines will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early mornings on Monday, before the phenomena are extended late on Monday and Tuesday.
Strong rainfalls will spread in the For Corners area on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October, some sharp changes in temperature will be observed throughout the United States as temperatures fall in the Arctic, but in the tropical zones they remain quite high.
Sometimes, this leads to very intense changes in temperature at close distances.
A characteristic example of the sharp differences in temperature between the Central US was observed on Sunday.
There was a difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Groupa, Nebraska and between St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
In the following days, solid high heat temperatures will be observed and spread again.
In much of the Central and Eastern USA, October is expected to start with high temperatures at 27 °C from the eastern regions to parts in the south-east.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 °C on Tuesday, about 5 degrees above average.
According to our long-term forecast for the weather, there are several possibilities for observing temperatures above average in the Eastern US until the first half of October.
More than 20 million TV users watched Bret Kawano's hearing
More than 20 million TVs have been watched by the candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court of Brett Kawano, Thursday and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which is due to happen in the 1980s, Christine Blaise Ford, on six television networks.
In the meantime, the political failure continued with the television networks to interrupt the normal flow of the program for the last time of Friday: the agreement by the Mayor of Arizona Jeff Fleic to conduct a one-week FBI investigation in relation to the categories.
Ford told the Committee on Justice of Georgia that it is 100 percent sure how at a party while she was a high school student, Kawano attacked her while he was drunk and took her clothes off.
Kavano, in a loaded deposit, said it's 100 percent sure that something like this didn't happen.
According to Nielsen's measurements, more than 20.4 million televisions are likely to be heard on Friday.
The company reselled the media on the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC networks.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that broadcasted the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually finds it difficult to calculate the number of televisions watching a broadcast from office premises.
To see this television in the right dimensions, it is a common size with what is being observed in a football match of the Oskar prizes or the award ceremony.
The Fox News channel, whose journalists strongly supported the appointment of Kawano, was preceded by an average of 5.69 million televisions during the entire day’s hearing, according to Nielsen.
In the second place, ABC is located with 3,26 million televisions.
They followed CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high and after the hearing.
Flake turned out to be a champion on Friday's drama.
Following the declaration by the Republicans that he would vote in favour of Kavano, the CNN and CBS cameras registered Friday morning demonstrators to approve him as he was trying to enter the elevator for hearing from the Justice Committee of Georgia.
He stood watching low for a few minutes as they welcomed him, live on TV at CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
He said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Fleic said his office had made statements and, before his elevator doors closed, that he would have more to say in the Commission's hearing.
All cable television and transmission networks were covered alive a few hours later, the Parliament's Committee on Justice voted on the promotion of the Cavan's candidacy in the plenary vote.
However, Fleic said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the claims against the candidate next week, something requested by the majority of the Republicans.
Fleic believed in part after discussions with his friend, Governor of the Democratic Party, Chris Kuns.
After discussions with the Cons and some other mayors, Fleic decided.
Fleic's choice was valid because it was obvious that the Republicans would not gather the votes for the Cavan's approval without conducting an investigation.
President Trab asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavano.
British Prime Minister May blames her critics for playing games with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused the critics of leaving the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in a conference with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives at the Conservatory Party Conference in Berminham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her at the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson has been criticizing the Chechers Plan for Brexit, saying the proposal to collect tariffs between Britain and the EU was "very absurd".
Weid Sims Shooting: Police arrested suspect Dataon Simson for murdering the player in LSU
Police picked up a suspect for the deadly shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dayon Simson, 20 years old, was arrested and detained in a second-degree murder prison, according to Baton Rose's police department.
The authorities have in their hands a video from Sims' complex with Simson and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the box.
The police found the glasses in the crime scene and said they found traces of Simson's DNA, according to the WAFB that cooperates with the CBS.
After Simson's investigation, the police said they admitted that he had wounded Wade fatally.
His guarantee was set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
According to the preliminary report by the Eastern Baton Rose medical judge who released Friday, the cause of death is the bullet wound to the head and neck.
The Ministry made available to the Louisiana Police a special working group, the police crime lab, the police forces of the South University and the citizens of the area for assistance in the investigation of arrest.
LSU's sports director Joey Alèva welcomed the local law enforcement authorities for "researching and pursuing justice performance".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,985-metre Squared raised Baton Rose, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 riboons per race last season.
On Friday morning, the coach of the LSU Wil Wade basketball team said the team was "concentrated" and "in shock" since Weid's death.
"We always worry about events like this," Wade said.
Hepastatic ash emissions in Mexico City
The equestrian ash emissions from the Popokatepetl efaester have reached the southern vicinity of the Mexico capital.
The National Catastrophe Prevention Centre warned the residents of Mexico on Sunday to stay away from the volcano, after the activity in the container reached its peak, recording 183 gas and dust emissions within 24 hours.
The Centre was monitoring various indications and small seismic vibrations.
Images in the social media show parking cars covered with minute layers of ash in the neighboring city of Mexico like Sochimilco.
The geophysicals have observed an increase in the activity of the epithet, located 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital since a 7.1 earthquake occurred in central Mexico in September 2017.
The Efaesterium, known as Don Gogio, has been active since 1994.
Police forces clash with Catalan self-defencers in view of the vote on independence
Six people were gathered in Barcelona on Saturday after a conflict of protests in favour of independence with the rehabilitation units of the class, as thousands participated in the demonstrations for the first anniversary of the vote to reject Catalonia that caused pollution.
A group of mass protestors for independence, which were held back by the rehabilitation units of the class, hatched eggs and powdered powder, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually covered by tourists.
Complications were also noted later during the day with the police to use their clubs to create the complications.
At times, groups of supporters of Catalonia's independence called the slogan "We do not forgive, we do not forget" against groups of demonstrators for the unity of the country called "Live Spain".
Ten people were hospitalized with microinjuries observed during the demonstrations, according to the local type.
The tensions remain high in the area that supports independence one year after the declaration of the 1 October referendum as illegal by Madrid, which is nevertheless celebrated by the Catalans.
The overwhelming majority of the voters chose independence, although accession was low with those who opposed the independence of the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year, after the police authorities tried to stop voting at the polling stations in the area where violent complications were observed.
Groups for independence camped off Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
The event took place elsewhere, and it was necessary to take a different amendment.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, an electronicist who participated in the protests for independence with his wife, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's prospects to win his independence.
"We lived one of our brightest moments last year.
I saw my parents with tears of joy able to vote, but now the situation is stable," he said.
Despite the fact that they have won a victory of vital importance, while limited in the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties have fought for independence to maintain their strengths this year, with many of their most well-known leaders to be self-excellent or to be held in custody pending their trial for their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Putes, a 42-year-old mechanic, who recorded the protests for the police with his cell phone, said that the conflicts were fuelled by both political and military forces.
"The tension is growing more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Zunkera, one of the nine Catalan leaders who were detained last year, announced his candidacy in the European elections for the next year.
"My candidacy in the European elections is the best way to denounce the suppression of democratic values and the pressure we have received from the Spanish Government," he said.
London: Arresting a man after a car hit in the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a repeated car crash in London.
The incident unfolded in Bolingcard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemings said damage was caused to the gates and to the building itself.
There may have been a shooting in the car at some point.
Menga's hit won Livingstone's 1-0 win against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first ball for Livingstone secured the victory
Provincial Livingston surprised the Rangers by thanking Stephen Jarard just his second in 18 games as a manager of the Ambrox Group.
Dolly Menga's hit made the difference as Gary Holt's side changed the level with Hibernian in second place.
The Gerard team remains unbeatable in the championship of this season and deals with the Charters, which have a lead of eight degrees, next Sunday.
Before this match, the Rangers host Rafid Viennese in Europe League on Thursday.
Livingston in the middle continues its course in six games in her category, with Chief Coach Holt not yet tasted anything since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against visitors
Holt's team should've taken the lead long before he scored, with his inability to put the Rangers in a difficult position.
Scott Robinson took the lead and thought he could get to the end just before the end, but Alan Lithkow broke his efforts by glancing Craig Halket's head away from the end.
The farmers let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could beat the visitors in free beatings and corners.
And that's how the big ball came.
The Rangers couldn't prevent a free hit, and Livington opened, Declan Gallagher and Robison cooperated to send the ball to Mengka, who took the whole thing and ran out of the area.
Until that point, the Rangers had ruled in the possession of the ball but found the defense of the peasants unsurpassed and the security guard Liam Kelly did not face difficult situations.
This pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos dropped the ball from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's ball disappeared from the ranks of Rangers Alan McGregor's security guard, and Lithkou's bag went out to another liveston free shot.
There were a lot of sittings in the Livington area and they were constantly disappearing, and they were asked for two pens - after Halket's award of the ball against the replacement player Glen Mindleton and one by hand - that were rejected.
"Excellent game" by Livingstone - analysis
Alexander Lambond from BBC Scotland on Tony Macaroni Arena
Thematic performance and results for Livingstone.
All of them, in particular, were excellent, exceeding expectations in this direction.
The style of the game and their personality changed slightly after their return to top shape, but the stamps should also be given to Holt for the push he gave to the team with his arrival.
His team had so many heroes.
Chief Halket was excellent, returning an extremely organized defense, while Mengka kept Connor Goldson and Joey Weirl in custody throughout the game.
The Rangers, on the other hand, had no inspiration.
As good as they were in the past under the guidance of Gerald, they did not respond to these standards.
Their last game was poor - only once they managed to pass the defense of the fields and this is a warning campaign for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the ranking.
Mixing feelings at Erdogan's reception in Cologne
The climate was good on Saturday (29 September) at the meeting of the Heads of State of Turkey and Germany for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of the contested visit of President Erdogan to Germany, which aimed at restoring relations with NATO allies.
They had come up against issues such as human rights, type freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to launch a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
The police for security reasons ruled out the concentration of the crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators against Erdogan - many of which were from Kurdish origin - have also given up at present, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The division of demonstrators reflects the doubtful nature of a visitor treated by some Turkish as a hero and others as a dictator.
Road accident in Detford: a dead rider after a car crash
A biker lost his life in a car crash in London.
The accident took place near the intersection of the streets of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a multi-purpose street in Detroit, south-east of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped, and the ambulance's saviors tried to help, but the man lost his life on the spot.
The conflict occurred a few months after a similar incident where a driver hit and left a bicycle, who lost his life on the road of Chillers Street, about 1.6 miles from the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said the authorities are trying to identify the man and inform their closest relatives.
The roads have closed and the roads of the buses have been trained, while the drivers have received instructions to avoid the area.
Long Artine Prisons: Six policemen were injured in complications
Six policemen were injured in riots that broke out in the high-security men's prisons, according to the statements of the Prison Directorate.
Tragedy broke out in the prisons of this Grand Duchy of Long Lartin in Worstersair at about 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still in progress.
Special police forces called "Tornado" have returned to deal with the riots involving eight detainees and who have appeared on a block.
The police were hospitalized with microinjuries on the face during the complications.
A representative of the prisons said: "A specially trained staff took up dealing with the event in the prisons of this Grand Duchy of Long Lartin.
Six staff members were hospitalized with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be sent to the police authorities and that they may be more punished."
More than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals, are held in the prisons of this Grand Duchy.
In June, the Prison Director was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, the class rehabilitation units were called to prison to send serious incidents that broke out during which staff members were attacked with balliards.
Roza typhoon threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (dry areas may benefit)
It is rare to have a tropical effect on Arizona, but this is precisely likely to happen at the beginning of next week, as the remnants of the Rose Mountains will cross the south-west sections of the desert, bringing floods to their passage.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued emergency flood warning reports for Monday and Tuesday from the western Arizona to the south and eastern Nevada, southern California and Yuta, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaf, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Roza typhoon is expected to pass right above Phoenix on Tuesday, where it will arrive late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service stated on its tweet that only "ten tropical cycles have remained in a tropical storm or low barometer at less than 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a typhoon less than 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest U.S. National Bridge Centre models provide a rainfall of between 2 and 4 inches, with individual rainfall volumes of up to 6 inches in the Arizona Mongol Rim.
In other regions of the South Western States, including the Central Mountain and the Grey Basin, rainfalls of 1 to 2 inches are likely to occur, with the possibility of individual total rainfall volumes up to 4 inches.
For areas that are not at risk from floods, the rain brought by Rosa may be a blessing, as the area is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, a part of this rainfall is expected to be beneficial, as the South-West states are experiencing drought conditions today.
According to the U.S. Development Observatory, more than 40 per cent of Arizona faces at least extreme drought, which is the second highest drought category," said weather.com.
First, Typhoon Rosa will reach the shore of the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Maintaining the intensity of the storm, in the morning of Sunday, Rosa will be located 385 miles south of Puta Eugenia, Mexico with a maximum of 85 miles per hour and will move north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will meet colder water in the Pacific and will therefore be weakened.
Thus, it is expected to reach the ceiling in Mexico with tropical storm intensity in the afternoon or in the evening of Monday.
There may be a severe rainfall in areas of Mexico, which will pose a significant flood risk.
"There are expected total rainfall volumes of the class of 3 to 6 inches from Baha California to the north-west Sonora, which may reach up to 10 inches", according to weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north across Mexico as a tropical storm now and reach the Arizona border early in the morning of Tuesday as a tropical low barometer, which will then pass through Arizona to reach South Juta late in the night of Tuesday.
"The main risk expected by the Rosa typhoon or its remains is the very intense rainfall in Baha California, the North West Sonora and the South-West States," said the U.S. National Tyre Centre.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous heavy floods and snowflakes in the deserts and floods in the mountains.
Attack on Mindsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested as suspects of attempted murder after the identification of a 16-year-old who was injured by a knife in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terras area of Midsomer Norton, about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he remains in a stable state.
A 17-year-old, two- 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Randstock area, Aveon and Somerset police said.
The cops are calling to present anyone who may have recorded on a video on his phone what happened.
Trab says Kavano "lived the evil and the anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote in favour of Judge Kavano is a vote of rejection of the unjust and exorcist regimes of the Democratic Party," Trab said at a meeting in West Virginia's Willing.
Trab said Kavano "lived the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party all the time during his demonstration process as a candidate.
Kavan placed it in Congress on Thursday, denied indictable and with obvious conviction that Christine Blaise Ford's claims that she had been sexually assaulted decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also set up a hearing for her claims.
The President said Saturday that the "American people saw the greatness, quality and courage" of Kavan that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavano's candidacy is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our day, a lawyer with an excellent public service path," he said to the majority of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred directly to the candidacy of Kavano, speaking about the importance of Republicans' participation in the mid-term elections.
"We have five weeks since one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but actually it's like I am," he said.
"That's why I travel everywhere supporting excellent candidates."
Trab reported that the Republicans are on "resistance and prevention" mission.
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on Kaban's candidacy is expected to take place at the latest on Friday, the CNN referred to a senior auxiliary member of the Republican Party's leadership.
Hundreds of people were killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia and the total number of victims is expected to increase
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were driven by the giant waves that swept the coasts, when a great earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the authorities said on Sunday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Paul on Friday, when waves of six feet [6 m] hit the edge of the valley, leading many to death and destroying everything in their passage.
The tsunami occurred after thirst of 7.5 Richter.
"When the threat to tsunami came out yesterday, the world was still on the beach and it didn't run right away, so it was hit by it," said Sutopo Pourvos Nogrocho, a representative of the Indonesian BNPB disaster management service, in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, drove cars, trees, houses, hit everything on the street," Nigroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled to the ocean at speeds 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people crawled into the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerophotos published by the disaster management service show many ruined buildings and shops, bridges that have been built and destroyed and a roof surrounded by water.
Transfers continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt in a region of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Service (BPPT) reported that the energy released from the huge earthquake in Friday was about 200 times greater than the individual bomb dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geography, which is at the end of a narrow valley, may have increased the size of the tsunami, he mentioned.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and reported that hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
He mentioned that victims were found trapped under the wreckage of broken buildings, adding that 540 were injured and 29 were ignored.
Nugroho said that the victims and the damage may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palou, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the centre of the earthquake.
The communication systems "have completely failed and there is no information" from Dongala, he said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," Red Star said in his statement, adding that his staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy and it can get even worse," he said.
Yesterday's criticism was carried out at the Service on Saturday because it did not inform that tsunami had hit the Palus, although according to officials the waves had reached the time of the warning.
In a racist video reported on social media, a man on the top of a building is heard to shout panic in an attempt to warn people down the road for the tsunami that is coming.
In a few minutes, a wall of water falls on the coast, tearing houses and cars apart.
The Reuters software was not able to verify the visibility of the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major interruption of the current, which also cut off communications in the wider region of Palus, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts from the authorities.
The army began to send transport planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the displaced continue to need food and other basic necessities.
The airport of the city opened again only to contribute to the bidding efforts and will remain closed until October.
A visit by President Joco Wyntonto has been scheduled at the decommissioning centres in Palou on Sunday.
The tsunami victims in Indonesia exceed 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although World Vision's staff from Dongala managed to safely reach the city of Palou, where workers found refuge in accommodations from Muslims who were stationed in front of their office, passed through disaster scenes on their way, Mr. Dosseba mentioned.
"They told me they saw many ruined houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some petition groups have taken on the sad task of initiating the relief process for the victims, some complain that it did not affect foreigners, particularly experienced workers in the relief sector, to travel to Palus.
According to the Indonesian regulations, the flow of funding, supplies and personnel from outside may only start if the place of competition is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It continues to be a disaster at the level of the province," said Aulia Ariani, representative of the Indonesian Red Star.
"When the government says it's a national disaster, we can address a request for international assistance, but there is still no relevant decision."
As the second day went by in Palus after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, the friends and family who are still missing hope that their loved ones will still be the miracle that will make the story of these natural disasters less ghastly.
On Saturday, a little boy retired from a sub-lawyer.
On Sunday, the saviors released a woman who had been trapped under a snare for two days, next to her mother's dead body.
Genton Subadon, a coach of the national team on the coast of Indonesia, had trained two of the missing racers for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Maddzi, were his students.
"The oldest in the sport of the elusive plagiarism, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Genton was told how, when news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was released in the community of the alexitist beaches, he began sending unmistakable messages to his opponents at the Palace who participated in the festival on the beach.
However, the indication next to his messages was a grey symbol "n", instead of two blues.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Stealers broke off $26,750 during the automatic take-off machine in Newport and Levi.
In the early part of Friday, thieves broke off $26,750 from a Brink's staff who was making a supply of ATM machine in Newport and Levi, according to a Newport Police Department paper.
The driver had removed an ATM machine in the entertainment facility and was preparing to deliver other money, police officer Dennis Macarthy reported in the notice.
While he was busy, another man "was running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was intended for delivery.
The witnesses saw many suspects leaving the scene, according to the announcement, but the police did not identify the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity should contact the Newport police, calling at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Yi
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Yee.
Advertised the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The one who is officially known as Kanie West."
West, 41 years old, has been listening for a long time to the gay Yu and has used this nickname as a title in his eighth album, which he released in June.
The change was preceded by his appearance at the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to present the new Yandhi album.
In contrast to the show, the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her appearance for "sympathetic reasons", as the show's creator said.
Except that it is a summary of the professional name used today, West had stated in the past that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think the word 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, in a discussion about his album title with the radio producer Big Boy.
So it's me, it's us, it's us.
My name changes from Kanye, which means "the only one", to Ye, which is just a reflection of the good, the bad, our confused self, everything.
The album is probably a reflection of who we are."
It's one of the many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sin Cobbs is known for various names, such as Paf Daddy, P. Ddy or Ddy, but he announced this year that he prefers the names Love and Brader Love.
A former West co-worker, TZI-ZI, is also satisfied with the use of his name with or without shoes and capital letters.
The elected president of Mexico swears he won't use the army against the citizens
Mexican elected President Andres Manuel Lobez Obrador swore he would never use military violence against citizens, as the country is nearing the 50th anniversary of a bloody student oppression.
Lobez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelko Plaza Square that "he will never use the army to oppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, troops shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, during a period when left-wing student movements acquired roots throughout Latin America.
Lobez Obrador was committed to supporting the new Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving young people to criminal alliances.
The US should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this area, says the investor and professional in the field of artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment is added to the announcements made by various parts of the U.S. government on artificial intelligence, as the U.S. does not have an official strategy for artificial intelligence at all.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year to become the world's first country in innovation on artificial intelligence issues by 2030.
"The duplication of the research budget on artificial intelligence would be a good principle, since all other countries remain so much of the US and we are trying to make the next important discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The duplication of the budget could double the chances of the next major achievement in the US in the field of artificial intelligence, Li said in his interview with the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book entitled "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (The virtues of artificial intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the new world order of things) released this month of the editions Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is Director of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the top intellectual societies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in a system of artificial intelligence that won the best American player Otello, while later he was executive member of Microsoft Research and president of the Google Annex in China.
Lee recognised the importance of previous US government technology competitions, such as the Robotic Initiative of Advanced Research Plans for Defence (DARPA), and wondered when the next one will be held to identify the next viewers.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to receive state grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the best of the academic space, it's companies," he said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university authorities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee supported that changes in migration policy could also help the US to support its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that a green card should be offered automatically to teachers in artificial intelligence," he said.
The State Council of China issued a Plan for the Development of the Next Generation Engineering in July 2017.
The National Institute of Natural Sciences of China provides funding to people in academic institutions such as the National Institute of Sciences and other government agencies share money in American researchers, but the quality of the academic project in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established a Joint Arts Centre, where partners will be joined by the business and academic world, and the White House announced the formation of an Military Commission for the Artist Law.
This month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The U.S. National Science Foundation today invests more than $100 million a year in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, no progress has been made in US legislation for months to set up a National Security Committee for Artificial Law.
Macedonia's citizens take a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia took part in a referendum on Sunday to decide whether the country would be divided into "the Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would lead to a decade-long dispute with Greece that had blocked the country's candidate for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, supports that the name of the neighbouring north represents a confession on its territory and has been vetoing its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the PGDC population.
President George Ivanov said he would not participate in the referendum and a Boikotaz campaign has raised doubts as to whether participation would reach the required 50 per cent to be valid for the referendum.
The question on the vote was: 'You are in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the agreement with Greece'.
Protesters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zeef, support that it is a price worth trying to integrate into organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that have emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the country's future, so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because so the lives of all of us will be safer," said Oliver Georgievska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a number of Members of Parliament have stated that they will comply with the outcome of the vote in order to become final.
A two-thirds majority is required for the change of name in Parliament.
The State Election Committee stated that there were no reports of irregularities up to 1 m.
However, the participation reached only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, so it gave the present 66 per cent of the registered voters.
"I have come to vote for my children, our position is in Europe," said José Tanevski, 62 years old, voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoraf Zeif, Zorika's wife and Dosko's son voted in the referendum on the change of the name of the country that would open the way for the country's accession to NATO and the European Union to the city of Strumika of Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vlandimir Kavardarkov prepares a small stage and places chairs in front of scenes that have been suspended by those who will be voting.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads high, not as second-class partners," Kavardarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become members of the enlarged Union."
Prime Minister Ziph said that joining NATO will bring a number of investments to the MDG, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaf said after he voted.
He said that a positive result would be "the confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published last Monday by the PDB Political Research Institute, a percentage of 30 to 43 per cent of the voters, i.e. less than the required participation, would participate in the referendum.
According to another survey conducted by the TV station Telma TV of Macedonia, 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said he would vote positively.
In order for the referendum to be successful, participation must reach 50 per cent together with one vote.
If the referendum fails, this will be the first serious blow in the politics of the friendly government, from its abyss in power last May.
Watch: Manchester City's August Sergo spends all of Breton's defense to put a bullet in it.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling were the Bryton's defense, winning 2-0 for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihand Stedium in Manchester, England.
Aguro showed to score easily in 65 minutes.
The Argentine offensive took everything in the middle of the ground at the beginning of the phase.
He's been through three Briton's defenses before he forgets about the open space.
Then Agur was found surrounded by four green players.
He went through a defense with a stripper, then running away from several others at the edge of the big Breton area.
Then he gave everything to his left, finding Sterling.
English Squared made his first move to the area by returning the ball to Aguro, who used his right foot to win Briton Matthew Ryan's termite guard, scored on the right side of the grid.
"Aguro is dealing with some problems at his feet," city teacher Pep Guaridola told reporters.
"We told him to play 55 with 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a ball at the time."
However, it was Sterling who gave the Galaxians the original advantage in the battle of Prime Minister Lig.
This bullet came in 29 minutes.
Aguro took the ball deep in the Briton area at this stage.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left-hand side to Liroy Shane.
Shane kept the ball in his possession and led Sterling to the back dock.
The gala parked the ball on the grid just before it came out.
Siti faces Hofenheim in the Chambions Lig groups on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. on the Rain-Neckar Arena field in Sinsheim, Germany.
Sergeant wants to beat the Rockys.
As the Niasionals were excluded from the playoffs, there was no reason to try to make another launch.
But the always competitive ranger is hoping to play the Sunday against the Colorado Rocky, but only if there are still any effects on the Rocky on the beach, as they are preceded by a game of Los Angeles Dodgers at the Nazional Lig West.
The Rockies have gone to the playoffs with their victory 5-2 against the Nazionals on Friday night, but they still want to lock the first position in their category.
"We have nothing to gain, at least we can play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the fans and the other team will probably be a game of the highest level I will face this year.
Why don't I want to fight in such a fight?"
The Nazis have not yet announced who the original thrower will be on Sunday, but it is reported that they tend to let the Sharer throw the ball.
The Serger, who will make his 34th start, made a training dump on Thursday and will play Sunday, which is usually a day of rest for him.
The right hand from Washington has performance 18-7 with average score points (ERA) 2.53 and 300 out due to strike in 220 2/3 periods this season.
Trab speaking in West Virginia
The President referred directly to the situation regarding his elected candidate for the Supreme Court of Bret Kavano, in his speech on the importance of Republicans' participation in the mid-term elections.
"All we've done is betrothed in November.
We have five weeks from one of the most important electoral procedures in our lives.
This is a very important moment, but I am not a candidate, but in fact it is like I am and, for that reason, I travel everywhere to support excellent candidates," he said.
Trab went on to say, "You see this sport, the sport of the Democratic Group, you see what's going on right now.
And they're determined to take back power using any necessary means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to destroy to take power and control, because what they want is power and control and we're not going to give them them."
The Democrats, he said, have taken up the mission of "responsibility and prevention".
"And you see this in the last four days," he said, characterizing the Republicans "troubled and bad, ridiculous and lying."
It was referred to the Judicial Committee of Georgia by referring nominally to the Ombudsman of the Republic of Denmark, a reference which was accepted with possible public approvals.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you discovered the document?
Oh, oh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting for an answer, that was a really bad use of the body language, the worst use of the body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad extension.
It is not against those who express their opinion.
It didn't surprise me at all that Momentum's activists in my local team voted against me.
In addition, I am the last of a number of Members of the Working Party to whom they said they were not welcome, precisely because we say our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, had a similar approach because he was decisively opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, my motion for a motion of censure was criticised because I appealed to Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, in vain, for similar issues with which Jeremy had argued with previous leaders.
The call for a meeting of the Nottingham East Workers on Friday stated that "we want our meetings to be productive with everyone's participation."
Most of the eight-year-old I am a local worker, the meetings of the General Committee on Friday night were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, today, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more plausible, more sympathetic" policy has been forgotten for a long time, if it has ever really begun to be implemented.
It is increasingly evident that the different views are not excluded from the Working Party and that every opinion is based on whether it is accepted by the Party's leadership.
This started a little after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom I had previously considered that we had similar political views began to expect me to turn 180 members and adopt views that I would never agree with, whether they were on national security or the single EU market.
Every time I spoke in public, no matter what I was really saying, I heard a whisper in the social media, where some asked for my rejection, got the policy of the centre and told me that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And that didn't just happen to me.
Indeed, I know that I am happier than other colleagues, as the comments addressed to me were usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a winter of sexual or racist abuses every day, but they never fail.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time in politics is how the attacks are considered to be more regular.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a broad extension and that with any proposal for a compromise or a change in the rules of choice, the limits of the party are narrowing.
I've been advised in the last two years not to stand up, not to talk too much, and so "everything will be fine."
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a student, because of the neglect shown by the Government of Thatzer that has literally led my entire class to failure, my aim was to protect better public services for those who need them most, either as a member of the local council or as a minister of the government.
I never hid my policy and did the same in the last elections.
No one in Southingham East could have confused in any way about my political views and the points of my disagreement with today's leadership.
In those who have promoted the Friday motion, the only thing I have to say is that, while the country is facing a Brexit that will affect our households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on whether I am faithful to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, really, my only message is not addressed to Momentum's members in Southingham, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Working Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of rejection or political intention will prevent me from acting as I believe it is to the best of your all.

Ir - Melrose: 38 - 17: The Incredible Irish climbs up to the top
Two late goals may have somehow distorted the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Ir deserved to triumph in this excellent entertainment day of Ted's championship.
It's now at the top of the ranking, the only useless team of the ten.
Finally, it was her upper defense, as well as the best exploitation of the opportunities, which led to the wild for the peasants and coach Peter Murchi had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've tried our games so far and we're still worthless, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose said, "Thanks to Ir, the opportunities are being exploited better than we are".
Grand Anderson's ball in the 14th minute, with Fraser Klimo's conversion, brought Air ahead, but a yellow card to Scotchzo Rory Hugs, who was committed to the Georges game, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the digital advantage and Jason Bagott noticed a ball without conversion.
The climate increased the lead of Ir with a pen, before it scored, precisely in the mid-year, a ball with a conversion, leading Ir to the scores 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half-year well, and Patrick Anderson's golf course, with Bagott's conversion, reduced progress to five degrees.
There was a long wait because of a serious injury by Rurid Nott, who was removed by a bus, and, after the resumption, Iir also increased the difference with a ball by Stafford McDonald, with a change in climate.
Deputy Chief Blair McKerson then took a yellow card, and Melrose again took advantage of Bruce Colvin's football without conversion, after a period of intense pressure.
The peasants returned, however, and when Struan Jackson took a yellow card for a Taklin in the climate without the ball, by the line of the pen, McCarson scored a ball in the back of the attack that Ireland had launched.
Climate has made a transformation, as it has done almost again since the resumption, since Kyle Rowe first picked up David Armstrong's block and sent Gregor Henry off for the fifth golf course in the fields.
Still Game champion starts a new career in focus
The lead player of the Still Game Ford Kiernan series shows ready to switch to the focus industry after it has been revealed that a director of an licensed restaurant company has been appointed.
56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays the role of the BBC's popular show, which he writes and competes with his former partner in the Greg Hembfil comedy.
The couple announced that the next fifth round would be the last of the show, and it seems that Kirnan is planning his life after Geigland.
According to the official records, he is the director of the company Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the information, although a source of Scottish Sun was alleged that Kirnan wants to deal with the "absolute focus industry" in Gloscow.
"The sea is ours": the closed Bolivia hopes that the court will once again open the way to the Pacific
The sailors run at the fully equipped captain of the ship in La Paz.
In the public buildings, there are blue flags.
At the base of the sea from the Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is written the statement: "Our sea belongs to the right.
It's our duty to take her back."
Throughout the vast majority of Bolivia, the memory of Chile’s coastline after a bloody conflict for the exploitation of natural resources in the 19th century continues to be alive, as well as the desire of its people to travel to the Pacific once again.
These hopes have been renewed more than ever, for decades now, as Bolivia expects the International Court of Justice to decide on 1 October after five years of consultations.
"Bolivia has the dynamics, a spirit of unity and calm, and of course awaits the result with a positive eye," said Roberto Calzandilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will monitor the decision of the International Court of Justice in large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia's conviction that Chile, after decades of unrest, is obliged to negotiate for Bolivia's granting a master's exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charming automous president of Bolivia, who is giving a contested battle for the re-election of his next year, has much to gain or lose from Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is not likely to decide in favour of Bolivia and that even if it did, they would not change much.
The UN agency in the Netherlands does not have the power to give thousands of seats and has made it clear that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's decision is to be issued only six months after the submission of the final proceedings suggests that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of further promoting the goals of Bolivia, the past four years may have undermined them.
"The current government of Bolivia has cleared the issue of access to the sea," Zarate said.
Morelas's aggressive rhetoric has exhausted every remaining good mood of Chile, he supported.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk for a while, but it will be extremely difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged mail since 1962.
Former President Edwardo Rodríguez Velje, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an excellent opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility to "end up disputes 139 years with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzandilla also denied that Morales, who still is one of the most popular leaders in Latin America, uses the issue of exit to the sea as a political dean.
"Bolivia will never deny its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we must go beyond the past."
North Korea declares there will be no nuclear disarmament if the US cannot be trusted
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho says his state will never disarm his nuclear weapons first if he can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit in Singapore by the heads of the two states.
Ri made these comments while US Foreign Minister Mike Pompey seems ready to start the nuclear diplomat he had reached the end three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea leader Kim Young Oon.
Ri states that the view that continued sanctions and the refusal of the United States to declare the end of the Korean War will at some point require the North to "genuine" is a dream of a hot night.
Washington insists that the relevant declaration be issued if Pionging does not make major disarmament movements first.
Both Kim and the American President, Donald Trab, want a second summit.
But there is widespread speculation about whether Pyongyang is seriously considering declaring a weapon that the country probably considers to be the only means of guaranteeing its security.
Pompey plans to visit Piunjiang next month to prepare a second meeting of top Kim-Trab.
The fashion proofs of Paris reveal the latest trends in the oversized hats that will soon be available in a store near you
If you want to increase the collection of hats you have or completely avoid the sun, then stop looking.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented in the passarela a series of foreign super-magnetic hats for their collection in Spring-Kalokari 2019 who stole the show in the Fashion Week in Paris.
Extremely bad hats opened Instagram this summer and their designers sent their impressive creations to the pasarela.
The piece that he left Valentine was a super-bash hat decorated with a flat steel plate that completely covered the head of the models.
Among other oversized accessories were shells decorated with stones, a magic hat, even a pineapple, but these have not been designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a series of strange masks over the time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had rusted lips and were more inflamed in Hannibal Lekter than in a high-strength fashion.
One creature brought into mind the complete equipment of blowouts with a fan and glasses, while another looked like molten ice in a hog.
And if you want to adopt this fashion style with the huge accessories, you're lucky.
Stylists predict that these huge hats could reach central commercial roads near you.
The oversized hats made their appearance very quickly after the "La Boba", the tiny hat with the very wide edge we've seen wear so many, from Ryan to Emily Ratakowski.
The popular company that created the extremely bad hat that exposed the social media sent still a great creation to the pasarela, a tiny beach bag almost as large as the model it wears by wearing its magic.
The dark orange bag of reefs, decorated with croissants of reefs and a white leather handle, was the piece that disappeared from the La Riviera Spring-Kalokari 2019 collection of Jacquemus in the Fashion Week in Paris.
"I expect to see large hats and large beach bags in the shops next year, as the designer made such a big feeling that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for excess accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are needed for the citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland have a history of academic excellence, which continued in 2018, with still a number of outstanding results in the examinations, which were simply reinforced by individual and collective achievements in sports, arts, music and other Community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), are striving to provide the best possible level of service to their students and parents.
The aim of independent schools is to prepare their students for the next and higher levels of education, the career they will choose as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a school curriculum by order, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable school choice lesson.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language that he understands, then what you say is in his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, what you say is in his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot simply be based on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of the annual surveys, we find that the languages are at the top of the performance tables, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who have learned foreign languages have achieved a degree of efficiencies A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also had grade A.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages are considered to be as important as science, technology, engineering and mathematics courses in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 U.S. Employment and Skills Committee survey revealed that, as regards the reasons why employers found it difficult to cover jobs, a 17 per cent grade was due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, the need for language skills becomes increasingly urgent so that young people are prepared for their future career.
Since more future employment opportunities require language skills, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career you will choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future, because of this ability that you can enjoy throughout your life.
If anyone is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, then automatically this multilingual person will have an advantage over competition.
According to a survey by YouGov in more than 4,000 adults in the US in 2013, 75 percent of the respondents were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a discussion, while French was the only language speaking a double percentage of the respondents (15 percent).
That is why investment in language learning is important for today's children.
Knowledge of many languages, especially languages of developing economies, will give children the best opportunity to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on the most modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the EU by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be some languages to choose in independent schools, which have specialized teaching staff in this area.
The independent schools of Scotland provide with dedication a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to achieve, whatever the future holds them.
No one today can deny that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be extremely important for the future of the country, so this reality should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, multiculturalism and flexibility for Scotland's young people.
They have to do it.
John Edward is the director of Scotland's Independent Schools Council.
Lebron's gonna make his deposit to the Lakers on Sunday at San Diego.
Waiting for the friends who are desperate to see Lebron make his first appearance with the Los Angeles Lakers has almost ended.
Laker Luke Walton's coach announced that James would play the first game on Sunday before the match against the Denver Nights in San Diego.
However, it has not yet been decided how many minutes it will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said in the Lakers' official website.
Lakers Mike Trudel's reporter wrote on Twitter that James is probably gonna play for a few minutes.
After training a few days ago, James was asked about his plans for the six games that the Lakers have to give before the race period.
"I don't need preparations at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
The Trab concentration in West Virginia, Canali YouTube
President Donald Trab begins a series of meetings starting with West Virginia's Wiling.
This is the first of five scheduled concentrations of the Trab next week, which includes periods in friendly offered areas, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote confirming his election to the Supreme Court to be held in expectation, the Trab seeks to strengthen public support for the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress by the November vote.
What time is Trab's concentration in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
The Trab concentration in West Virginia's Wiling is scheduled for 7 μm ET tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch the Trab concentration in West Virginia online below via live stream on YouTube.
The Trab is likely to refer to the hearings of this week for the candidate for the position in the Supreme Court, Brett Kavano, which took place in a wide atmosphere due to allegations of sexual misconduct, with a vote confirming Georgia pending until one week while the FBI's investigation is in progress.
However, the primary objective of this series of mergers is to help Republicans who face a controversial outcome in the November elections in order to gain some momentum.
Thus, the outcome of President Trab's campaign stated that these five concentrations next week aim at "mobilizing volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority of representatives in the Parliament and the Parliament of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so crucial to his agenda that the president travels to as many states as possible, as we travel in the multi-story campaign period," said Reuters representative of the Trab campaign, who wanted to remain anonymous.
The planned evening meeting at the Wesbanco Arena of Willing could bring supporters from "Ohaio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
The Saturday will be the second time in the month that Trab visits West Virginia, the state that won a difference of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
The Tribe is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in West Virginia for Georgia, who is low in the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisei that the president must come and try to give him a push to the traps," said Simon Hender, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team has the tendency to fight by keeping the hopes alive as it leads to Sunday's singles
After three single-sided games, Saturday's squares might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The talented end of the band is a fully understood sport idea, but players believe it deeply, and especially in such measurements.
Where would they say the rope is now?
"There were six steps ahead and now there are four in front, so we probably have a little rope," Jordan Spit said as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage of, of course, being ahead of it at four levels and remaining twelve still in the game.
The Americans, as Spith says, feel the "air on their tires" and have a lot to encourage them, like the two Spiths and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each one broke down three of the four.
Spyth was deadly from tea to green and gives the example.
The cheering voices became more powerful as he continued his round, winning a crucial blow to get the game four all-square when he and Thomas were down two after two.
The beat they won the game at 15th was accompanied by similar celebrations that show their belief that the American team is not outside.
"You have to look deep inside and worry about your game," Spit said.
It's what every player has left.
18 holes to write history.
The only players with more degrees than Spy and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flywood, the unmistakable story of Ryder Cup.
The strange but precious twin of Europe has succeeded four in four and it seems that it does nothing wrong.
The "Mollywood" was the only twin that didn't hit bogey in the afternoon of Saturday, but also escaped bogey in the morning of Saturday, the afternoon of Friday and the back nine in the morning of Friday.
This game, as well as the way the energy seems to flow to and from the noisy viewers, expresses the fact that it is the players that should win Sunday and that there is no more popular player than Flywood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory while the sun runs above Le Golf National.
I prefer both at the same time in different doors.
The debate on European honour remains premature.
Baba Watson and Web Simpson put their glasses on Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourball, when he played with Alex Noren.
With a bogey and two doubles on the front nine they had Spain and Sweden so deep in a hole they couldn't get out of it.
But on Sunday, there will be no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so exciting to watch them closely because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how a strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a significant lead on the last day, but this foursome game has also shown that the US team has balls, despite some doubts.
Europe takes the lead 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after its race at the fourballs and the foursomes on Saturday with 10-6 against the US.
Tommy Flywood and Francesco Molinari's inspired twins had two winnings against a struggling Tiger Woods and managed to take the lead in Le Golf National so far at four levels.
The European side of Thomas Beorn, who is trying to maintain the troops he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the weak American side in the morning fourball, with a series of 3-1.
The U.S. opposed the foursomes more, winning two matches, but they could not cover the difference.
Jim Furick's side needs eight degrees of the 12 single Sunday matches to maintain the troupe.
Fleetwood is the first European newly-displayed player to win four degrees series, while with Molinari, also known as "Molywood", after a clumsy weekend, it is just the second two that wins four degrees in the four first games in Ryder Cup history.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reid at the fourballs, they joined their forces to destroy a tired Woods and the American newly discovered Brison DeSambo with an even more vivid 5&4.
Woods, who turned on the two Saturday matches, showed a random flash of light, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourball and foursome and seven series.
Justin Rose, who took a break for the morning fourball, returned to Henry Stanson's partner for the 2&1 foursomes of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepka, winning the first and third place in the world ranking.
They did not all go well for Europe, despite the pleasant, sober day of southwestern Paris.
The three times winner Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set up a two-degree American take on Saturday.
They won a difficult 2+1 victory over the John Ram and Ian Paulter of Spain at the fourballs and returned later to win the Pauler and Rory Macilroy 4&3 at the foursomes while they had lost the two holes at the opening.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history could a team recover while losing four degrees in the singles, although because it's the tripler, Furick is enough to achieve equality to maintain the troupe.
However, after being found in second place for two days, it seems that a reflection on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it's not going to be disarmed alone without confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions deepened the sense of distrust against the United States and that his country was not going to leave its nuclear weapons alone under such conditions.
Ri Young Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea had received "significant good will measures" in the past year, such as the cessation of nuclear and ballistic tests, the decommissioning of nuclear testing facilities and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such conditions there is no way to start our disarmament alone."
While Ri repeated a well-known recommendation by North Korea on the resistance of Washington to the possibility of a "stationary" approach to depuration, according to which North Korea will be rewarded as it progresses progressively in the process, its statement was important that it did not completely exclude depuration, as Pionging did in the past.
Rei referred to the public announced by Kim Young Won and Donald Trab at the first summit meeting that took place between an active president of the United States and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work for the "repurchasing of the Korean peninsula", while Trab promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea seeks to officially end the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first "lost" its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted the calls for the relaxation of the severe international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S. is insisting on "first nuclearisation" and is increasing the pressure by threatening with sanctions to achieve their goal by exorcising, even putting obstacles in the "war's end" declaration," Ri said.
"The idea that punishments can father us is a dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continued punishments deepen our dissatisfaction."
Ri made no reference to a planned second summit between Kim and Trab, which the U.S. leader pointed out to the United Nations earlier this week.
However, the minister noted three meetings between Kim and South Korea leader Mun Je-in in the last five months and added: "If the partner on the issue of nuclearisation was South Korea and not the US, the nuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such an outflow."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from yesterday, when he said to the United Nations General Assembly that the goal of the U.S. envoy with North Korea's ballistic missiles was inevitable because the Bad President Trab called Kim "a fireman" in a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, the Tribe, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, chose Kim's body for his courage to move forward with disarmament measures, but said that there should still be much to do and that sanctions should remain in force until North Korea is detonated.
On Wednesday, Trab said he had no timetable for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia support that the UN Security Council should reward Pionging for the measures it has taken.
However, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompey told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue to be intense and indiscriminate until full, final and confirmed nuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously approved the sanctions for North Korea since 2006 in an effort to neutralise the financing of Pionging's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri at the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Piningung again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeii has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Piñang in July saying that he had made progress, to be accused by North Korea a few hours later that he had "the demands of a gangster".
North Korea was committed to meeting with the Moon this month to decommission a nuclear facility and also a nuclear assembly, if the United States were to take "anti-measures".
He explained that Kim told him that the "anticipating measures" he was seeking were security guarantees that Trab promised in Singapore and were promoting the reconciliation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are following lessons about how to get enough rest.
This year, a new study at Harvard University seeks all the progressive students to sleep more in an effort to combat the growing mass culture of the night study with the consumption of a lot of caffeine.
One academic discovered that students at the number 1 university worldwide often do not know basic things, e.g. how to care for themselves.
Charles Chasler, Professor of Medical Respiration at Harvard Medical School and a specialist doctor at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, planned the study, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was urged to start the lesson after a talk about the effects of sleep loss on learning.
"In the end, a girl came and said, "Why do I know that just now, in my last year?"
He said that no one had ever talked to her about the importance of sleep - something that surprised me," he said in The Telegraph newspaper.
The lesson, which started for the first time this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performances, as well as to improving general well-being.
Paul Barry, Professor of Psychology at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University's Health Services, said that the university decided to include the study when it was found that students were staying asleep within a week to a significant extent.
The fine lesson includes a series of interactive works.
In an element, there is the image of a student audience, where students click on cups of coffee, shirts, sports shoes and books, to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performances are affected by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of sleep routine.
In another unit, participants learn how long-term sleep loss can increase the risk of inflammation, brain, depression, and cancer.
A map of the university, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the conduct of students directly.
We believe, however, that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects when you choose to smoke," Professor Chaisler added.
His culture to be proud of because you've been studying all night, he said, adding that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students means that falling asleep is a problem that needs to be addressed.
A lot of sleep, good quality, should be the "secret weapon" of the students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, as sleep loss puts the brain in a state of lucidity, resulting in a permanent feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian professor of Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Chasler to plan the study, having attended one of his classes last year, his first year in Harvard.
He said his class opened his eyes and inspired him to press for a lesson in the whole university.
The next step, hopefully, is to ask all the graduate students to monitor a similar programme before they start their studies at this particularly competitive educational institution.
Professor Chasler advised students to adjust a notification for the time they should go to sleep, as well as an alarm clock for the time of awakening, and to know the harmful consequences of the "blue light" emitted by electronic displays and LED lighting, which can detach the circular rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston - Rangers 1-0: Menga is putting a bullet in Jerry's men.
The Rangers had another sad situation outside the building, as Dolly Menga's south led Stephen Jarard's disoriented side to live on 1-0.
Ivorx's team wanted to mark the first victory outside of February's triumph with the 4-1 in St. John's, but Gary Holt's team just caused Gerard's second in 18 games as a coach, leaving the team eight degrees behind the Charts, which is the first in the ranking of the Ladbrokes championship.
Menga hit seven minutes before the mid-year, and the inconceivable ranger of the Rangers seemed unable to respond.
While Rangers is now in sixth place, Livington's going up third, with just one bullet different from the Hibernian that's going ahead.
And the Rangers can wait for other trouble, as the Calum Spence, then, had to get first aid for injury to the head caused by the object that was thrown out of the floor.
Gerald made eight changes to the team's composition and destroyed Air in the semi-finals for Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same composition "Live 11" that took a degree from the Card last week and would be happy with how this cooled machine was able to drown every effort of the opponents.
Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingstone did more with the ball.
He should have scored in the second minute, when Menga's first long distance sent Scott Pittman into Alan McGregor's area, but the average didn't find the ball.
A deep free suite of Kigan Jacobs found Chief Craig Halket, but his opponent Alan Lithkou's only defense was to send the ball away from the dock.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in the game in the last three.
Alfredo Morellos certainly believed that he should have won a pen at 15', as he had a conflict with Steven Loules, but dissident Stephen Thomson ignored Colombian's insults.
The Rangers had only two suits in the area in the first half of the year, but the former Eifrox terminal guard, Liam Kelly, didn't worry at all about the head of Lasana Kulmbali and Ovi Ezaria's subtonic suite.
Even though Livi was clearly below expectations in the first 34 minutes of the match, no one can deny that he deserved the victory for the effort and only.
And again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' problem.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher hit Scott Robinson's ball, who kept his cold and found Mengka who just completed the effort.
Gerard made changes in the half-year by pulling out Kulmbali and putting Ryan Kent. The change gave up almost immediately, as the extreme swept the ball to Morello, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block him.
However, Livingston continued to drag the guests into the style of the game he knows and enjoys, with Lithkou and Halket to remove one long ball after the other.
Holt's side could have increased the difference to the end, but McGregor treated Jacobs in the same way, stopping him before the Lithkou attempt from the corner.
Raingers' alternate, Glen Mindton, had another phase for a pen at the end, as he had a fight with Jacobs, but still Thompson ignored it.
Almanak: The inventor of the meter Geiger
A page from the German Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882: like today, 136 years ago and BALE ... the day the future natural John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, which eventually led to the device that is now known as the Geiger meter.
In the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with the leading players of the incredible cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Andras: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, used to detect radioactive metal elements such as the sky.
When you wear these hearings, you listen to the action of people caused by radiation to the metal elements."
Evans: "Look, it's like crazy!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, the invention bearing his name continues her work.
A new angina vaccine teaches the immunosuppressant to "see" the problem cells
A new angina vaccine teaches the immunosuppressant to "see" the problem cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immunosuppressive to identify the problem cells in the treatment
The method includes the export of immunocellulars from the patient and their modification to the laboratory
They can "see" a protein that's common to various types of cancer and then re-infuse them
One vaccine under test has a positive effect in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize the problem cells saw the cancer of her ovaries disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes the export of immunocells from the patient, their modification to the laboratory so that they "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results show that we have a very hopeful vaccine in our hands."
As Professor Berzofski explained, the HER2 protein "is the motor force for the development of several types of cancer", such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung disease, and intestinal thickness.
A similar approach to which immunocells are exported from patients and then how to target cancer cells has been used to treat a type of leukaemia.
Kanie West defended the Trab, wearing a hat with the MAGA badge, after his appearance in SNL.
It didn't go very well.
Kanie West was awarded at the studio during a Saturday night live after an alternative interview with US President Donald Trab and said he would run the election in 2020.
After presenting his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he wore a baseball hat with the slogan “Make America Great Again” (To Do America’s Great Again), he gave a resurgence against the Republicans and renewed his support to the Tribe.
"I talk to a white man many times and he says to me, "But how do you like the Trab?
If I was worried about racism, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
SNL opened up with a sketchbag that Matt Damon was running, with Hollywood star to smuggle Bret Kawano's statement before the Court Committee of the State on Christine Blazey Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, the video with West's termination went up in social media by comedy Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to frame West with this suspension.
Also, West protested to the public that he was not treated well because of his hat.
"They made me a bulling in front of me.
They said, "Don't come out with the hat."
They made me a bulling!
And they say I don't know what's happening to me," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "I don't know what's going on with me, I'll wear the Superman's coat, so no one can tell me what to do.
Try love."
His comments were acknowledged at least twice by the public, and SNL's factors seemed to be in a difficult position, said Variety, with a person saying in the magazine: "The whole studio had a fatal silence."
West was called a replacement of the last moment of the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, had escaped a few days earlier.
West confused a lot when he sang I Love It dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West supported Kantas Turner, head of the TPUSA conservative group, who tweeted: "Before one of the most courageous spirits: IN THE EYHARISTER OF THE EARTH".
However, the showcase, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just "himself and that's wonderful".
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his "art") who believes that he is embedded and exhibits ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So do we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "the one who was previously known as Kanie West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Ddy's steps, also known as Paf Daddy, Pafi and P. Ddy.
The rapper Snup Doug had changed his name to Snup Lion and, of course, the legend of the Music Prince had changed his name first to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince.
A category of attempted murder to attack a knife at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old was charged with attempted murder after a knife attack on a man at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Balikahamor, according to the police.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Court of Justice.
The Star of the Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, criticises toxic arthropodity
Kit Harington is known for the role of John Snow in the violent middle-century fantasy series of HBO, the Game of Thrones.
However, the actor, 31 years old, condemns the stereotype of the hero, saying that such roles in the screen pass on to the little boys the message that they should be hard to win respect.
Speaking in The Sunday Times Culture magazine, Keith said that "something goes wrong" and wondered how the problem of toxic fertility in the #MeToo era can be combated.
Kit, who recently married his partner at the Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted to having a "strong view" on the matter.
"Personally, now, I believe it very much, where did we make the mistake of adultery?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up about the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can partly be responsible for increasing the toxic fertility due to the harmful nature promoted.
He went on, "What is implanted and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets, making young boys feel that they should show such behavior to be men?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time.
There's something wrong with our young people."
The interview also admitted that it does not intend to play in any prequel or sequel of the Game of Thrones, after the end of the series next summer, saying "end in battles and horses".
As of November, Keith will be taking the lead in reviving the True West project of Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently discovered that his acquaintance with Rose's wife is the best thing he ever learned from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in the series, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from here and beyond," she said.
Rose was in love with Eggret, John Snow's fallen lover, who is in love with Kit, in love with Emmy's series.
The couple married in June 2018 in the family village of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in its population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health services.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new infringements were reported.
In the majority of them, the new errors were transmitted through sexual contact, marking a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, the HIV virus spread rapidly in certain parts of China due to blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way was almost zero, as leaders of the Chinese health sector said at a conference in the province of Yunan.
However, compared with the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a very serious issue for the LaoT community in China.
Homophilia was criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination at the expense of the LOAT community remains a common phenomenon.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of these diseases are due to insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised global access to anti-HIV drugs in an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters accuses an expert of breaking the data of Republican mayors, condemning the "hazardous lies" and the "consensual ideas"
This Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters advised the allegations that a member of her staff published personal information from three Republican mayors on the website of Wikipedia of the legislator.
The Republican Member of Los Angeles argued that the claims were promoted by commentators and websites of the "right side".
"Truths, lies, and even more terrible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information is provided to include the housing addresses and phone numbers of Mayors Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hats of Juta.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and appears to have been published by an unknown person from the Capitol Hill environment during the hearing of the Committee of the Senate on allegations of sexual misconduct against the applicant for the Supreme Court of Bret Cavano.
The leak happened at some point after the three guards had questioned the Cavan.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Puntit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the reports was associated with the Waters office and published data from a member of Waters staff, reported The Hill.
"This baseless claim is a completely false and repugnant lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been breached because of these frauds and false allegations, was in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This baseless claim is a completely false and reprehensible lie."
Water's statement was quickly criticised on the Internet, among other things by the former White Oak Press Secretary, Ari Fleser.
"This diagnosis is full of anger, Fleser wrote.
"This shows he has no tendency to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
He shouldn't be a traitor.
He must not doubt the motives of the accused.
He must be calm and calm."
Flesser seemed to compare his reaction to the reaction of the Republicans to the criticism of Judge Kavano, who was accused by his critics of feeling very angry at the hearing of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who seeks to corrupt Waters in the interim elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's huge if it's true," tweeter.
In her statement, Waters reported that her office had informed "the competent authorities and the law enforcement authorities about these false claims".
"We will do everything we can to find those responsible," he continued, "and account for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to any and all my staff members."
Movie review Johnny English Again - a subtonic spectacular movie with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit's marks in every new British-style movie, and this seems to apply to this revitalization of the comic-action film Franchis with hero Johnny English, which started in 2003 with the Johnny English film and came back in 2011 with the Johnny English film: The Return.
Could this humorous self-satisfied matter be how obvious we are to be the new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the disabled Johnny Ingles with his eyed eyes was able to renew his license to make them hostage for the second time. His name states that it is a wider comical creation designed for non-English cinematographic viewers.
This is, of course, the Azama secret agent who, while pretending to have the light and the ways of a secret agent, brings a little to Kluzo, with a dose of "Lord Bin" and something from the guy who played one and only a notch on the music theme of the movie The Paths of Light at the opening of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
It is also based on the travel and international mystery man who once drowned Atkinson in Barclaycard's most forgotten TV ads, slamming the gap in his passage.
There are one or two great moments in this last film of JE.
I liked it when Johnny Ingles approached a helicopter dressed in mediocre armor and the elics hit his skull.
Atkinson shows his talent in the comedy, however, humour is quite subtle and strange paraphanic, especially when "serious" cinematic franchise such as the 007 and Hazardous Mission contain enough comical data.
The humour seems to address children rather than adults, and in my opinion, Johnny Ingles's crazy rides are not as inventive and relevant as the sketches of an Atkinson's cotton filmmaker for Binson's person.
The eternal central issue is that Britain has a serious problem.
A governor has penetrated the super secret Internet network of British spymen, exposing the identity of all British agents in the mission, to the great disappointment of the agent in service, whom Kevin Elton is forced to play in an unfortunate role in his well-being.
It is the last drop for a ambitious and ambitious prime minister who is at the heart of her collapse because of political hostility: Emma Thomson does what he can best with this character that reminds Teresa May, but the scenario does not help her in particular.
The information advisers shall inform it that, as each active purpose has been revealed, it should bring back a person who has been detained.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a director at an aristocrat school, but gives unparalleled lessons for secret agents: there are some nice scenes here, as England offers an Academy of Type A School of Rock.
England returns to Wythol for urgent information and reunites with Baff's former and patient partner, who is still invading Ben Miller.
Baff is now married to a midwife, a crazy role in which Vicki Perdín is not fully used.
Thus, Batman and Robin of the harbor for the Secret Service of this Magnificent are returning to action, meeting the beautiful and partial Ophelia Bulettova that Olga Kirlenko is subject to.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is attracted to the massive billion-dollar technology that claims to be capable of solving Britain's technological ills: the threatening Jason Volta, whom Jake Lacey is subject to.
England and Baff begin their phasocommodation: transformed as waiters, set fire to a quiet French restaurant, cause damage as they attempt to cross illegally into the luxury yachts of Volta, and England causes anarchy as it tries to use a virtual reality device to familiarize itself with the interior of Volta's home.
All the jokes are used in this last scene, but as precious and fascinating as it is, it continues to remember a little child television.
A lot of things.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I wonder: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he will really grow up with his talent?
The workers report that they are considering a plan to work for the British four-day, but to be paid for the fifth.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is going to consider a radical plan to work the British four days a week, but to be paid for five-year work.
The party, according to information, seeks the owners of companies to award the savings achieved through the restoration of artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an additional day off.
Thus, workers will enjoy a three-day weekend, without a reduction in their wages.
Sources indicate that the idea coincides with the economic agenda and the party's plans in order to return the balance for the workers.
The change in four-day week was approved by the Congress of Labour Councils in a way that benefits workers from the changing economy.
A higher source than the Labour Party stated in The Sunday Times: "It is expected to announce a policy change before the end of the year.
"It won't happen in one night, but the four-day work week is a ambition directed at the group's approach to rebalancing the economy for workers, as well as the overall strategy of the group on industry."
The Working Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its general pre-election campaign in 2017.
However, this vision is currently not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A representative of the Working Party said: "The four-day working week is not a party's policy and is not considered by the party".
The secretary of the shadow government, John McDonnell, used his Labour Conference last week to develop his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power by the "personal directors" and the "devices" in the companies of common benefit.
The plans of the secretary of the shadow government also mean that today's shareholders in the water companies may not take their full share back, as a potential labour government could make 'reservations' due to suspicious accidents.
It also confirmed the plans to place employees in the company's administrative boards and to create mutual participation funds to give 10% of private sector companies to employees who will receive annual shares of up to 500 pounds in England.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking at the 60 minutes show about whether the FBI's investigation for Cavan could change their opinion.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavano has delayed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the decisions of the service could affect some Republican officials in order to withdraw their support.
In his interview on Sunday, Scott Peley, in response to the 60 minutes show, asked Republican journalists John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could break anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more openly than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, I do," said Kennedy.
"I said that by going to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavano.
I called him after the incident, when the complaint came out, and I asked him rightly: 'Did you do it?'
He was an amethyst, determined, accused."
However, Graham's vote seems not to change.
"I've decided on Brett Kavano and I'll need some kind of explosive charge to change my mind," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Bret refused it strongly," Graham added, referring to Christine Blazey Ford.
"And whoever has named it can't confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see anything change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how much has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a rich program and amazing stars, as well as an equally impressive mission: eradicating global poverty.
For the seventh year now, tens of thousands are scheduled to flock to the Great Lawn of Central Park in the context of the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Saint Martin, but also to be sensitive to the real goal of the event, which is the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international pressure group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of those who are actively fighting it.
In order to ensure a free ticket to the event (except if they were willing to buy a VIP ticket), interested parties had to complete a series of missions or "actions", as volunteers say, send an email to a world leader, call or find other essential ways to contribute to their awareness of their goal of poverty eradication.
But how successful is Global Citizen, while remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of reparation with a free concert the appropriate way to convince our fellow citizens to take action or is it just another case of so-called "clicking" when someone feels that they really make the difference by signing an electronic request or by sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen Group has reported that it has written more than 19 million "actions" than its supporters, promoting a number of different objectives.
It states that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies corresponding to more than $37 billion, which will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and notifications as a result of these actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been disbursed or concentrated.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the core commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British association of investors and performers, who have undertaken to "help children to make full use of their opportunities", promising to give Rwanda 35 million dollars to eliminate bribery, having received more than 4,700 tweets from members of the Global Citizens community.
"With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizens community like you, we can make social injustice a point of reference in history," says Tracy Ulman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, in the public during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, following the 5,000 actions that the United Kingdom called on to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project called The Power of Nutrition, which is directed at 5 million women and children with food interventions.
Answering the question "What makes you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?" which is included in the frequently asked questions on the site,
a member of the Global Citizen community replied: "The road will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like all the great movements for human rights and against the authority before us, we will succeed, because we are more united.
Janet Jackson, Wicked, Sean Medte, Cardie B and Janel Mona are some of the artists that will appear in the New York this year's event, which will be presented by Debora-Li Farnes and Hio Jackman.
The US can use the Marine War to "exclusion" by preventing Russia's energy exports - Minister of Interior
Washington can turn "if necessary" into its Navy in order to prevent Russian energy from being placed on markets, including the Middle East, as US Minister of Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where it takes place after a call from the legitimate government, is a facilitator for the investigation of new energy markets.
"I believe that the reasons why they are in the Middle East are that they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern and South Europe," he said according to information.
According to the Minister, there are ways and means to deal with Russian activity.
"The United States has the opportunity, with the support of the Navy, to ensure that maritime routes remain open and, if necessary, to exclude them, to ensure that Russian energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke was addressed to the participants in the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group characterized as the "consumer's voice" in the United States.
He agreed with Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are essentially the same.
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is, a little bit, the use and replacement of fuels," said Russia, saying with the character "pain knowing only one trick," as it has a fuel-dependent economy.
The statements were made as soon as the Trab administration has taken the mission to strengthen exports of American liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the cheapest choice for European consumers.
For this reason, the administration of the Trab, including President Donald Trab himself, is trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "appropriate" work on Nord Stream 2 which, according to the Trab, will make Berlin a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2, a work with a budget of 11 billion dollars, which is going to double the existing capacity of the treatments into 110 billion cubic measures, is a clean economic work.
Kremlin claims that Washington’s firm resistance to the project is driven for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the gas supplier they want," said Russian Minister of Energy Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Minister of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position provoked the reaction of Germany, which stressed its commitment to the implementation of the project.
Germany's top industrial organisation, the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the US to withdraw from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state intervenes in our energy supply," said Deter Kembf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vlandimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider the possibility of declaring a candidate for the Presidency in 2020, says Massachusetts Mayor
Masahushetti's mayor, Elizabeth Warren, said Saturday that he would seriously consider declaring a presidential candidate after the mid-term elections.
At a meeting in the capital of Hollowuk in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering the possibility.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our troubled government, and that's why a woman at the top needs to be at the top," The Hill said.
"After 6 November, I will consider the possibility of a candidate for the Presidency."
Warren criticised President Donald Trabb during the meeting, saying that "he leads the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Tribb is doing in our democracy," he said.
Warren didn't pick up her words about the Tribe and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Bret Kavano.
On a Friday tweet, Warren said that "of course it is necessary to investigate the FBI before the vote".
A review published on Thursday, however, showed that Voren's majority does not believe that he should put a candidate for the Presidency in 2020.
58% of the "possible" voters in Massachusetts said the sponsor should not apply, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% were in favour of such a candidate.
The survey showed more support for a possible candidate by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a possible candidate and 48% in favour.
Other popular names from the Republicans discussed in connection with a potential candidate for 2020 are former CEO Joe Baiden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Bermuda.
Baiden said he would have decided officially by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Peelin referred to Trak Peelin's Trak Peelin's Trak Trab in the Donald Trab concentration.
Trak Pilein, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after his strategy in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night.
"With what my son has been going through since he came back, I can understand other families who live with the effects of the Trauma Straits and the injuries our soldiers carry when they return to their homeland," he told the public in the context of the Donald Trab concentration in the Gulf of Oklahoma.
Paulin described his arrest as "a bomb ready to explode" and said about her son and other veterans that "they return a little different, return harder, return queryers if there is respect for what soldiers, aircraft and any other member of the army have done for the country".
He was arrested on Monday in Las Vegas and accused of domestic violence against a woman, an intervention in relation to domestic violence and armed robbery, while he was in a middle state, according to Dan Bennet, a representative of the police department in Guasilla.
18 states and the region of Colombia support the question of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the region of Colombia support a legal doubt about the new US policy that refuses to provide asylum to victims who are trying to escape from joints or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the region submitted a report to friends curiae on Friday in Washington, supporting an asylum applicant to question politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the strike in Greece vs. Session, submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union, has not been revealed in August against federal policy.
He stated that his partner "and his violent sons who are members of the partnership" had abused her, however, US officials rejected her request for asylum on 20 July.
He was in Texas.
Citizens' lawyers supporting Greece described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers in the United States come as countries facing intense problems with partnerships and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed the decision of 2014 taken by the Migration Decision Committee (IAB) and allowed unresolved immigrants who have escaped domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General of Colombia, Carl Rasin, said Friday that the new policy "is unknown to all decades of civil, federal and international law".
"In accordance with federal law, all asylum applications must be considered on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application. Such a collapse violates this principle", in the report amicus curiae.
The lawyers also claimed that the policy that refuses entry to migrants is damaging the US economy, claiming that it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and "be a necessary labour force".
In June, Judge General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims who were trying to escape from situations of domestic violence and compatriots.
"The asylum is available for those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or persecution because of race, religion, nationality or participation in a particular social group or political opinion," the Session declared in its statement on 11 June on politics.
The purpose of the asylum was never to alleviate all the problems (even the most serious) people are facing every day in the world.
Undeserved rescue efforts in the Palace, as the number of dead is doubled over the struggle to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was constantly worsening.
"It's very intense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, trying to relieve her baby who had a fever, in a eviction centre that had been placed in the destroyed city of Palau.
"Every minute the patients bring other bodies.
The clean water is pumping."
Some residents have taken the initiative to return to their ruined homes and to gather their existing water supplies, trying to expand what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, which were damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were unable to cover their needs.
Some wounded people, such as Dui Harris, who had suffered from a stroke of the middle and shoulder, stayed outside the Palace Army Hospital, where the first aid was given to the ground because of the ongoing strong movements.
The tears poured out his eyes as he taught how he felt the violent earthquake to shake the room on the fifth floor of the hotel shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I was trapped in the walls," Harris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city for a marriage.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then she took it quietly.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador blames China for "debt" with "propaganda advertising"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a quarterly advertisement in a daily U.S. newspaper, reflecting the mutual trade benefits between the U.S. and China, U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread its propaganda.
The US President Donald Trab reported last Wednesday on China’s paid-in bill, which appeared in Des Moines Register, the newspaper with most sales in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in Congress’s elections on 6 November, a category that China refuses.
Trab's accusation that Beijing has been involved in the U.S. elections marked what US officials told Reuters that it is a new phase of the escalating campaign that Washington has launched in order to exert pressure on China.
Although it is not prohibited for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a escalating trade war and have imposed various duties on imports.
The Chinese anti-dumping measures at the beginning of the trade war were aimed at affecting exporters in such countries as the Iova who supported the Republican Party of the Trab, mentioned Chinese and American experts.
Teri Brandand, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor with long-term status in Iowa, a state that is a significant exporter of agricultural products in China, said that Beijing had hit US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, as Brandt wrote in an opinion article in the Sunday Des Moines Register, "is showing this kind of manifestation by publishing propaganda advertisements in our free press".
"In the effort to spread this propaganda, the Chinese government is exploiting the valuable tradition of freedom of speech and the free press of America, publishing a payment ad in Des Moines Register," Branstant wrote.
"On the contrary, in the vicinity of Beijing, you will find few evaporative voices and no real representation of the different views that the Chinese people may have on China's troubled economic path, since the media are under the control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers has escaped the offer to publish" his article, although he did not reveal which.
The Republicans dismiss women voters in the interim elections because of the flag with the Caucasus, the analysts warn
As many top Republicans continue to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court of Britain Kavano despite complaints of sexual abuse, analysts warn that there will be a response, particularly from women, in the next interim elections.
The feelings on this issue are particularly intense and most Republicans have said they would like to proceed with the vote.
These things can't be restored," Grant River, professor of Political Sciences at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill about an article published on Saturday.
Rier doubts that the recent move by Colonel Jeff Fleic (R-Arizona) to request an investigation by the FBI will be sufficient to attract the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow, and they will certainly not forget it in November," said Karen Zan-Pierre, senior consultant and national press representative of the MoveOn, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators regularly called the post "November is coming!" on the way to Georgia, as the Republicans who control the Judicial Commission gave the green light for the Kavan's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blazie Ford, mentioned Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Republics will reach record level," said St. Rodenburg, an uncompromising political analyst, on the news website.
"They say it's already high, and that's true.
But it could be higher, especially in the group of unresolved female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29 years who, while opposed to the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public submission, in which he described in detail her allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, the analysts had predicted that there might be a reaction if the Republicans proceed with the money.
"It's a huge mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steel, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the vote on the committee or the final vote or whether Kawan will be put out; it has to do with how the Republicans handled the issue and how it was brought," said Gai Cecil, director of the Group of Priorities USA, who helps in the election of the Republicans.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe after Fortun and Cavan's claims, moving slightly more in favour of the latter.
A new review by YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents were sure or probably believed in Ford's claim, while 35% said that they were sure or probably believed in Kavano.
In addition, 38% said that he believed that Cavano probably or certainly lied to his statement, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Fleic's move, the FBI began investigating Ford's complaints and at least another complainant, Debora Ramirez, told The Guardian.
Last week, Ford filed an appeal before the Court Committee of Georgia that Kawan attacked her while she was drunk when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her her births while they were at a party when both were studying in Gail in the 1980s.
World's Inquisitor plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Burns Lee, the inventor of the World East, starts a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new pain of this legend of technology is Inrupt, a company based on Burns Lee's open solids platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data will be stored, as well as who can have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Burns Lee was ridiculed that the intention behind the Inrupt is the "world empire".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology by allowing users to create their own "personal electronic storage space" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, work lists, journals, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify to be all available in a browser program and all these at the same time.
The only characteristic of the personal data storage area is that it allows the user to decide who has access to such information.
The company calls this option "personal backup through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's executive council, John Bruce, is the company to offer resources, procedures and appropriate skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is made up of Burns Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some concerted programmers who worked in the work and a community of volunteer programmers coders.
Since this week, technology programmers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burners Lee said that his team and he didn't talk to Facebook and Google about whether they were allowed to make radical changes, blocking business models in one night.
"We don't ask for permission."
In a media release released on Saturday, Burners Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on the basis of Solid platform".
In 1994, Burns Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Technical Institute of Massachusetts (MIT).
In recent months, Burns Lee has had a strong voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even with Inrupt, Burners Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely excited about the next time on the Internet," Burns Lee added.
Bernard Van: Tax of Honor to a Retirement that received the Victorian Guard in the A' World War
The only heir of the Anglican Church who has received the Victorian Tower during the World War I as a soldier was honored in the home of 100 years later.
Vice-Chairman Bernard Van received the metal on September 29, 1918, for the attack on Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a free man four days later and never learned that he had separated the highest British military distinction.
On Saturday, the discovery of a memorial plaque was made by his two grandchildren, who were accompanied by a passage to the Northhamptonshire Rasden.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "excellent symbol" that the discovery of the plaque was made exactly 100 years after his grandfather's heroic act of taking the metal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Anti-Contender Van led his team to the Canal of St. Kent through a very dense mist and while he was receiving powerful weapons of war and troops."
Later, he jumped into the middle line and with "excellent manhood" led the line forward, before he struck himself alone with a weapon of battle three out of the split.
Vice-Chairman Van was killed by a German freeman on October 4, 1918, nearly a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's heroic actions were "something I know I could never get to, it's something that makes you feel immeasurably respected."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also deposited a stove after the passage, led by the new Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said that "he felt a great honor participating in the march" and added that "the manhood of a real hero is proved by the support he has of many people."
MMA's fans have stayed to watch Bellator 206, but they saw Peppa the Hurricane.
Consider the following scenario: You have visited to watch the exciting Bellator 206, but you are delighted to see this unique sporting event.
The program in San José included 13 matches, including six on the main card, and would live in the United Kingdom, from Channel 5, to the night zone.
At 6:00 p.m., as Gegard Mussie and Rory McDonald were preparing to go out in the ring, the audiences in the United Kingdom stayed alert when the show changed Peppa to the Uruguayan.
Some were not happy at all, as they had remained awake until the early morning hours especially for the race.
One Twitter fan described the show as "some kind of sick joke".
"In accordance with the legislation, this content was not suitable for 6 a.m., so the children's programme should be planned," said Dave Svarts, Senior Marketing Vice President and Bellator's Communication, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa the Furonaki, indeed."
Bellator's president, Scott Kocker, said that they are going to develop the programme to include the UK leaders in the future.
"If we think about the strips, I think we can do it," said Koker.
"But there are six Sunday mornings there and we will not be able to do it until our Sunday time, i.e. their Mondays.
But we're trying.
Believe me, when the change happened, a lot of messages were exchanged back and forth and it wasn't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
It wasn't, it was because of the rules.
I promise you, next time, it's not going to happen.
We're going to limit it to five matches instead of six, as we usually do.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Dale felt "redder" because of his sexuality
Olympiacus at the funerals, Tom Dale, said he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality, however, it moved him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until the high school that "they're not all like me."
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Lavern on Radio 4, he said he supported the rights of homosexuals to give the other "hope".
He also said that since he became a parent, he had less interest in winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Yang, a regular exhibition of known radio broadcasts, was for several months on leave due to illness.
As invited to Lavern's first show, Dale said he felt "insufficient" compared to others when he was growing up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like someone and boys and girls".
He said, "To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity have given me the strength and desire to succeed."
He wanted to prove it was "something," he said, so that he wouldn't let anyone down when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The second time a galkino Olympiacus is a pre-emption of the rights of the LATIC community and has taken advantage of its participation in the annual Community Games in Australia to call for more countries to proceed with the decriminalization of homosexuality.
He said he decided to talk, because he felt lucky that he could live openly, without any impact, and that he wanted to give other "hope".
Three times a world champion said "it was a surprise" when a man was in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Blake, whom he met in 2013.
Daily married last year the winner of Oscar Dustin Lance Black, who is 20 years older than him, but supported that the age difference was never a matter.
"When you spend so much in such a small age" (he first participated in Olympic Games at the age of 14, while his father died of cancer three years later) "it's hard to find a companion who has similar good and bad times."
The couple adopted a son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Dale said he changed "all his perspective".
"If you asked me last night, all I wanted was to win the gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than gold Olympic metals.
My gold Olympic metal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daily said his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether he had taken tickets for his 2012 Olympics in London, as he wanted to be in the first series.
"I couldn't tell him "Dad, you wouldn't be close to us to sit in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and only when he stopped breathing and was already dead did I finally accept that he was not incredible," he said.
The following year, Daily competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the calcined metal.
"I knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life, fighting in the Olympic Games in my home country, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of the first song, the Proud of Heather Small, which inhaled him during his preparation for the Olympic Games and still causes him to chirp.

The outside Mikelson will be on the ice on Saturday at Ryder Cup.
American Phil Michelson will record a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game at Ryder Cup, but he will have to improve his performance so he doesn't remember the wrong reasons.
Michaelson, who attends for 12th time (record number) in the two-year-old competitions, was required by Chief Jim Furick to sit on the floor for the fourballs and the foursomes on Saturday.
Rather than being at the centre of action, as usual for the United States, the winner five times spent the day worrying about the lines and "working" his game hoping to correct his problems.
Without ever having the most responsible driver even on the ground of his career, the 48-year-old game is not suitable for the close field of Le Golf National, where the remotes are often problematic.
And as if the difficulty of the floor, Mikelson, in the ninth Sunday match, faces Francesco Molinari, the British Open champion, who is working with the first appearing Tommy Flywood to win their four matches this week.
If the Americans, who were four degrees below the beginning of the 12 singles, can take the lead with a good start, the Mikelson game may be crucial.
Furick expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he's playing today, hit me in the back, put his hand around me and said he'd be ready for tomorrow," Furick said.
"He has great confidence.
His name is in Hall of Fame and has offered too much in these groups, both in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't count on him playing two games.
I was thinking more, but that's where we ended up and so we thought we should start.
He wants to get out there, like everyone else."
Michaelson's going to cross Nick Faldo's record for most Sunday matches at Ryder Cup.
It could mean the end of a career in Ryder Cup that didn't reach the height of his personal record.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 grand and seven and a half, even though Furick said his presence benefited the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to make jokes and he's excellent in the group room," he explained.
"I think the younger players were also having fun with him this week, and it was funny to see it.
His contribution is not just in the game."
The leader of the European team, Thomas Byrne, knows that the great advance can soon be lost.
Thomas Beorn, the leader of the European team, knows from his experience that a great advance that starts from the singles of the last day to Ryder Cup can easily turn into a pit.
Danos made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama game, where a team with Chief Seve Balesteros managed to take advantage of five degrees against the Americans, but he just managed to cross the finish line with a difference in his breast, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You always remember that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just after we were violent," Beorn said, in the picture, following the generation of 2018, to win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and to lead 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So the story will show to me and all the members of the team that this is not over.
We're going to be ready tomorrow to give it all.
We'll get out there and play right.
Nothing's finished until you see the grades on the table.
We have a goal, to win this outfit, and there we focus.
I always say that I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we know very well that in the other group there are also good players – the best in the world.”
Satisfied with the performance of his players in a difficult golf course, Beorn adds: "I wouldn't rush to predict the result.
Tomorrow's another animal.
The individual performance is measured tomorrow, and this is something different.
It's great to be in the field with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, then you're trying all your skills as a golf player.
This is the message you have to convey to the players, how to get the best out of them tomorrow.
You leave your partner behind, and he has to give it all and show himself the best."
Unlike Beorn, Jim Furick from the opposing team will ask his players to score better individual performances than those they had with their associates, except for Jordan Spyth and Justin Thomas, who won three degrees from the four.
Furick himself has survived both the end of the revolutions of the last day, as he belonged to the winning group in Brooklyn before the unexpected fate, as Europe did her miracle.
"I remember every breath of his word," he answered when asked how Ben Crenso, head in 1999, had pushed his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want a quick start like Brookline, like Medina.
When we get this rope, there's a lot of pressure in the middle of the race.
We decide our series accordingly and we play with the series that strikes us, we will try to do our magic tomorrow."
Thomas has taken the lead in the game and is dealing with Rory McCillroy at the top of the game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flywood and Ian Paulter, the rest of Europe in the top half of the series.
"I went with this group with this series because I think it covers the whole route," said Beorn justifying his choices for the singles.
New suspension for Germany's new warship
The new fleet of the German Navy should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the old warships of the wartime, but it will not be taken up until at least next year, due to poor systems and the costs incurred, the local media report.
The position in service of the Rheinland-Pfalz Freight, the shipyard of Baden-Wuerttemberg, has been suspended until the first six months of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which is called a representative of the armed forces.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy War in 2014, but the problems with the tradition were determined for the success of the ambitious plan.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships ordered by the Marine War in 2007 will replace the oldest Bremen class brakes.
They will bring strong rules, a series of anti-aircraft missiles and missiles against ships, as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, overheads and acoustic signatures.
Other important features are that the frequency of maintenance work is reduced, as the use of new brakes for up to two years outside the German ports will be possible.
However, the continuing delays mean that even if the warships are considered the latest technology, which will allow Germany to demonstrate its power abroad, until they are finally put in service, they will be already overdue, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 brake became the first seal last year, when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss ship in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a ship in a shipyard after the surrender.
There has not been much information known about the reasons for the return, but the German media reported a number of significant "deficits with software and material" that would put the warship into useless use if used in a war mission.
The software's problems were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships have a crew of about 120 sailors, just half compared to the oldest Bremen class brakes.
It was also discovered that the ship has much greater weight, which reduces its performance and limits the capacity of the Navy to add future upgrades.
The 7 000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz brake is believed to have the double weight of similar class ships used by the Germans during the Second World War.
In addition to poor equipment, the cost of the whole project (including payment training) was also a matter.
It is said that it reached the approximate amount of EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion), while the original budget was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems faced by the new brakes are particularly important since the German maritime power is aggravating.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bardels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy "will soon have no ship for missions".
The officer said that the problem had been resolved over time, because the old ships had been wrecked, but there were no other ships to replace them.
It was claimed that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class brakes could join the Navy.
The National Trust hides the secret life of the nightbirds
A new survey conducted in a village in the Scottish Hills seeks to discover how nightlifes use the place when they hunt for their food.
The results will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique pets and will contribute to the design of future actions for the protection of the environment.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will explore the habits of the common nano-hungry and micro-hungry, as well as dobington's octopus coffee and mythology in the Inverewe Gardens, in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the field to monitor nighttime activities throughout the season.
NTS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations using hand detectors.
The analysis of the sound of all recordings by specialists will test the frequency of night calls and what types of behaviour these are.
Then a map of the habitat and a report will be created to form a detailed picture of their behaviour on a site scale.
Rob Duar, an environmental protection consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are more important for nightlifes and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of the management of habitats, such as the creation of pastures and the best way to keep forests for nightfalls and other relevant species.
Nightlife populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly since the last century.
They are driven by the building work and development projects that affect the areas where they plant and destroy their habitats.
Respiratory and photosensitivity are also dangerous, as are adhesive films for flies and some chemical processes of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Nights are not really blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes to catch their food.
They use an advanced sound detection technique to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land all over the country, considers nightlife very important.
He has ten trained experts, who carry out regular investigations, inspect the areas where nightlifes are rooted, and sometimes rescue them.
The organisation has also created the first and only refuge of Scotland exclusively for nightlifes in Thrave, Dampris and Galoway, where eight of the ten species live in Scotland.
The farm manager, David Thompson, says the farm is the perfect nightland.
"Here at Thrave we have an excellent nightlife area," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of big trees and an ideal highway.
There are still many who do not know about the nights, so the work we do here but elsewhere will help us to better understand what they need to increase their populations."
It points out that it is important to first control of the presence of nightlifes before every household maintenance work, as the destruction of one and only small nests could kill up to 400 women and children, possibly eliminating the entire local population.
Nights are protected species and it is forbidden to kill them, disturb them, or disturb their peace, or destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferel, a member of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, encouraged the public to offer help.
He said: "There is much left to learn about our nights and many of our species we just don't know the evolution of their population."
Ronalto rejects allegations of rape, as his lawyers are preparing to send a German newspaper
Christian Ronaldo described the allegations of violence against him as "fake news", saying that some "want to be self-inflicted" exploiting his name.
His lawyers are going to notify the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the complaints.
The attacker of National Portugal and Yuvendos is accused of raping an American named Catherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the complaint, she was brought to pay $375.000 to buy her silence and not mention anything about the incident, said Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking on a live video in Instagram in his 142 million followers after the complaint, Ronalto, 33 years old, described the reports "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-time winner of Gold Ballas in the camera.
"They want to be self-inflicted and exploit my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous using my name, but that's part of my job.
I'm happy and it's all right," the player added smiling.
Ronalto's lawyers are preparing to notify Der Spiegel of the claims he has published, which have been described as "an unacceptable report of reputations affecting private life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "ethical damage due to the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of private life in recent years".
The case is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Vegas.
After being introduced to a nightly entertainment centre, Ronalto and Majoorga returned to the player's room, where she was brought to violence by nature in accordance with documents submitted to the Clark Regional Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell into the knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" one "the same guy", but he betrayed the other "one hundred".
The documents say that Ronaldo admits that they had sexual intercourse, but that it was conceivable.
Magiorga also claims to have gone to the police and to a hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to an extrajudicial arrangement, because she "was afraid of the possible antidotes" and was concerned about her "public execution".
The 34-year-old says he's trying to reverse the arrangement, as he continues to suffer from a metabolic syndrome due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was eager to receive a transfer to Real Madrid from Manchester Yunaitt during the alleged abuse, and this summer he moved to the Italian Yuvends to secure an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "will regret the loss of cars forever"
The United Kingdom "will regret it forever", if it loses its reputation as a world leader in the car industry after Brexit, Minister of Enterprise Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car industry said that the impact of cross-border delays in Brexit could cost jobs without agreement.
The factory in Bernston, where the models Auris and Avensis of Toyota are built, supplied nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will cease at our plant," said Marvin Cook, Director-in-Chief of Toyota in Bernston.
Other automobile industries in the United Kingdom have also expressed fears of leaving the EU without agreement on cross-border trade, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has stated that it will close Mini's factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems concern risks in the supply chain according to the car industry in the case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line follows just-in-time. The exchanges reach every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the United Kingdom and the EU for cars manufactured by order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, there may be problems at the borders, resulting in delays and lack of dependence on the industry.
It would have been impossible for Toyota to keep a stock more than a day in her factory in Derbesir, the company said, so production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Teresa May's plan for the future relationship with the EU "is working specifically to resolve the issue of cross-border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want the best possible agreement that will allow us not only a temporary success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," said Today at BBC Radio 4.
"The elements that come not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers are that the continuity of supply chains must be ensured."
Toyota was not able to say how bad it would stop production, however, warned that in the long term the additional cost would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsuvari, who has been working in Bernston for 24 years and is the trade union officer of the United in the factory, said that members of the body are increasingly concerned: "From my experience, if these jobs are lost, they will never return.
Government representative said: "We have presented an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trab's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, White House announces
The important meeting of Donald Trab with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can "delay another week", as the dispute for the candidate in the Supreme Court, Bret Kavano, announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Specialist Roger Miller, who investigates the Russian intervention in the elections, the Trab's aid links with Russia and the possible interference of justice by the president.
The Trab could fire the Deputy Attorney General, endangering Miller's independence, has been feeding Washington's bats for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had debated the possibility of putting his talks with Trab to record and making possible the removal of the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, however, he switched to the White House through reports that he was about to resign.
On the other hand, a meeting with Trab was announced on Thursday, which was then in the United Nations Organization in New York.
The Trab said he would "appreciate" not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed in order not to interfere with the hearing procedure before the Committee on Judicial Affairs of the Senate, in which he placed both the Cavan and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blazi Ford.
On Friday, the Trab ordered the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the claims against Kaban, thus delaying the vote by the Senate.
Sarah Sanders, Trab's type representative, appeared on the Fox News Sunday TV show.
I asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "It has not yet been set a date, perhaps this week, but perhaps another week of data for all other cases involving the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, I still like to keep the guy informed."
Some journalists have responded to this claim: Sanders has to make type information in the White House since 10 September.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why this is happening.
Sanders replied that the limited frequency of the information was not due to the "printing" movements of television journalists, although he said, "I will not disagree with the fact that they are being shown".
He then let it be understood that he would increase or direct communication between the Trab and the type.
"The President is giving more interviews than any previous president," he said, adding without adding: "We have looked at these numbers."
They will continue to carry out reports, said Sanders, but "if the guy has the ability to direct questions to the President of the United States, that is even better than talking to me.
We're trying to apply it often and you've seen that we've been applying it often in the last few weeks and it's going to get the type of information where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trab frequently accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or type interviews with official visitors.
Individual interviews are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably demonstrated why this is happening, with a counter-contractual and sometimes foreign appearance before concentrated journalists.
Minister of Health sends a letter to EU citizens working in the Scottish National Health System through fears about Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to EU citizens working in the Scottish National Health System to express the country's gratitude and to wish them to remain even after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Jean Freeman, a Scottish member, sent a letter, leaving less than six months to withdraw the United Kingdom from the EU.
The government of Scotland has already committed itself to covering the cost of applications for permanent residence ("setled status") for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Mrs Fryman wrote in her letter: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on departure continued during the summer and lead to expected decisions in the autumn.
However, the UK government has also increased preparations for a possible scenario of failure to reach an agreement.
I know that this period must be particularly difficult for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member to non-nationality.
Members from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christio Abercroby undergoes an emergency surgery after a head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers team's defender, Christio Abercroby, was subjected to an emergency surgery following a trauma in the head in the Saturday's race, where Tennessee State Tigers were fired with a score 31-27 by the Vanderbilt Commodores, as reported by the journalist of Tennessee newspaper, Mike Organ.
The chief coach of Tennessee State Rod Red told reporters that the injury occurred just before the mid-year.
"He came to the ice and just fell there," Rid said.
The nurses and medical personnel gave Abercroby oxygen to the ice and then put it in a container and transferred it back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris from the WSMV TV station in Nashville of Tennessee that Abercroby was out of the surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are "not yet any data on the type/extension of injury" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercroby, a second-year student under restricted participation regime ("redshirt"), spends his first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
He made five total taklin on Saturday before he left the game, thus reaching the 18 total taklin for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher interest rate for the sale of real estate in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged at a higher rate for the sale of real estate in the United Kingdom, while the additional funds will be used to provide assistance to the homeless, in line with the new plans of the country.
The measure will neutralise the success of the Corbin campaign to attract young voters
The increase in the end of the paper will be imposed on those buyers who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects it to raise up to 120 million pounds per year - to provide assistance to the victims
Foreign buyers will start to have a higher end of real estate market in the United Kingdom, while the additional funds will be used to provide assistance to the guests, as Teresa May announces today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbin's campaign to attract young voters with commitments to provide more economic accommodation and to target high wages.
The increase in the end of the paper will be imposed on natural and legal persons who are not taxed in the United Kingdom, while the additional amounts will strengthen the government's campaign to combat the lack of shelter.
The increase, imposed on the current end of the paper, together with the highest tax rates introduced two years ago for the second-house and leased housing market, may amount to three per cent.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs expects the measure to yield up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new properties in London are purchased from non-residents in the United Kingdom, leading to an increase in prices and making it more difficult for buyers to enter the market for the first dwelling.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "municipal cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new policy is introduced just a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the end of the paper so that more new people could get their first residence.
He categorised the large construction companies as holding the prices of the real estate, but acquiring land without, however, using it and calling on Mrs. May to destroy the fleets in financial houses to restore Britain's "supply".
Mr Corbin announced a series of impressive proposed rigid reforms, including rental checks and the ban on "no warrant".
He also wants to give greater authority to councils to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "For now I said that I would devote my prime minister to restoring the British dream - to improving life for every new generation.
This means the adjustment of the dissolved real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and companies based abroad to buy homes as easily as hard workers British citizens.
For many people, the dream of home ownership has become very distant and the lack of shelter is still present."
Jack Ross: "My absolute ambition is to train the Scottish team"
Santerland's leader, Jack Ross, says that his "extreme ambition" is to become at some point a coach of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scotchez is excited with the challenge of raising the team of northeastern England, which is currently in the third position in the English League One, three degrees below the top.
He moved to the Light Station in the summer, having previously referred St. Myren to the Scottish Championship the previous season.
"I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I received a call for the second national team and that was," Ross told Scotland's BBC on the radio show Sportsound.
"But I grew up looking at the Scottish team in Hamden all the time with my dad as a kid, and that's something he always pulled me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I succeed in training groups."
Among the predecessors of Ross in Santerland is Dick Andbokaat, David Moyes, Sam Alardais, Martin O'Neil, Roy Kein, Gus Poyette and Paolo Dji Kanio.
The former coach of Aloa Athletics reports that he did not feel thirsty when he was called to assign such established names to such a large group, having previously rejected approaches from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"At this point, success for me will be measured on the basis of the answer to the question "can I bring this group back to Prime Minister Lig?"
Because of the structure and facilities of this team, it belongs indisputably to Primer Lig," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'm probably going to consider myself successful here only if I can get the team back there."
Ross started his career as a coach just three years ago, having spent a period as an assistant coach in Dabarton and a period of 15 months in the training staff of Harts.
Then he helped Aloa return from the submission to the third category and led St. Myren from the hand of the submission to the acquisition of the Award next season.
Also, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlpool, Folkerk, St. Myren, and Hamilton Acandemical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," said the reminder of taking over the position of coach Aloa.
"I really thought it was more likely to be a coach than a player.
It sounds weird because I was doing it well, I was getting decent money out of it, and I got pretty high.
But playing can be hard.
You have to take a lot on a weekly basis.
I'm still having trouble with the anxiety and pressure of the job, but my coach's job fits perfectly.
I've always wanted to train and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than I've felt with myself all my life."

The best time for beer is at 5.30μ on Saturdays, according to research
The hot fuel boosted the profits for Britain's tested pubs, but brought greater pressure on the chain restaurants.
The pubs and bars marked an increase in sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but the profits of the restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, as the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, from CGA's advisory company, which collected the data, said: "The continuous sunlight and the greater than the expected participation of England in the World Cup resulted in July following a similar pattern with the previous month, in June, where the profits of the pubs increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were even more affected.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in restaurant revenues in June simply took place in July.
The pubs and bars serving alcohol have gone far better, with the corresponding figures of previous years that have risen more than the corresponding figures of the restaurants have fallen.
The pubs serving food also suffered the sunny days, although not as dramatic as the restaurants.
Looks like the world just wants to get out for a drink.
In all managed pubs and bars, liquor sales increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while food sales decreased by three per cent."
Paul Niuman, from the RSM company's recreation and hospitality analysis department, said: "These results verify the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of the important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales on the outside of the home market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups continue to be difficult, but the drop in sales by 4.8 per cent on an annual basis will be particularly painful data on the continuing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have appeared at a worse time for entrepreneurs in the centre and time would show if the lowest temperatures that we have experienced in August would give us a huge extension."
The total increase in sales to pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, was 2,7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in commercial name launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales index for the UK pub, bar and restaurant industry collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active groups, with a total turnover of over 9 million pounds and is the industry's established benchmark.
One out of five children keep secret accounts in social media, hidden from their parents
As research reveals, one out of five children - even 11 years of age - keep secret accounts in social media, hidden from their parents and teachers
Research in 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Insta pages in Instagram
This message encouraged the fear that sexual content is involved
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account to show their parents
One out of five children - even 11 years of age - create social media accounts that are kept hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Insta false accounts - this is a reference to the Instagram photo reporting website.
This message encouraged the fear that sexual content is involved.
Twenty percent of the students said they keep a healthy "main" account to show their parents while keeping private accounts at the same time.
A mother who accidentally found the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenage girl who encouraged others to rush her (“See me”).
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC in independent schools found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, while half of them were admitted to keeping secret accounts.
HMC President Mike Buukanan said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers succumb to the temptation to create online places where their parents and teachers cannot identify them".
Elind Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" at the Scottish Foundation Council
Eileend Doyle was elected as non-executive adviser to the Scotland Foundation Council at the annual General Assembly of the Director-General.
Doyle is Scotland's most popular sportsman, and President Ian Biti has commented on her election as a great opportunity for those who direct the sport to benefit from her wide experience at international level in the past decade.
"Eileend enjoys unhindered respect throughout the Scottish, British and world stable community and we are sure that the stable in Scotland will have a huge benefit from its entry to the council," Biti said.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the gold medal at 200 and 400 meters in the Atlantic Olympic Games in 1996, has won a total of four gold Olympic medals and is now a regular commentator at the BBC, remained desolate after a transient ischaemic stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time will show if and how much I'm going to get sick.
It was exhausting, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again, and today I'm doing charity exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertisement of a midwife comparing mothers to cows disseminates the online common opinion
A female production company has distributed the online common opinion with an advertisement comparing mothers who are breast-feeding with their own cows.
In order to launch the so-called "first-worldly restless and portable trailer", the consumer technology company Elvie released a humorous video clip advertisement to show the freedom it offers to pregnant mothers the new barn.
Four real mothers dance in a herd of cattle full of ashes, with a song that includes sticks like, "Yes, I'm wearing myself, but you don't see any tails" and "In case you haven't noticed, these are not masters, they're my tits."
The song goes on: "Take it, take it, feed it, baby, take it, take it, take it, take it on my ladies."
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, has resulted in an online opposition.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, as many say it does not take the "freak" of the dairy industry seriously.
"A very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to stay pregnant and be born to produce milk, but their babies steal it a few days after birth," someone commented.
Elvie's barn places discretion in a supportive breast (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else said, "Probably injured both for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a barn for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "An advertisement completely out of reality."
Others defended the advertising, while a woman admitted that her song seemed "a heart attack".
"I think it's a very clever idea.
I'd buy a treasure like that if I was still a treasurer.
The breathing made me feel just like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I didn't sit around over it.
It's a clever product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "It's a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who suck in breast milk (often at their place of work or in toilets) and feel like "golds".
It is not an advertisement that hurts or criticizes the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women's group discovers that everyone danced with the discriminating tents lying in their backyards.
The logic behind the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who suck breast milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's barn is completely unbearable, has no cables or tubes and puts discreetly into a supportive breast, allowing women to move, hold their babies and even go outside during the breathing.
Anna Balarin, partner and Executive Director of Creation at Mother, commented: "The Elvie barn is such a revolutionary product that it was worth a slow and challenging launch.
By making an arrangement between pregnant women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the mother’s milk intake and all the challenges she has, showing at the same time in a fun and coherent way the incredible sense of freedom that the new barn will bring.
It's not the first time Elvie has become a first.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared in the pasarela for the fashion designer Martha Yakumbosky while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved indiscriminately to camping on the borders of Texas
The number of children in detention of immigrants has risen, although the monthly border crossings remained relatively uninterrupted, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trab administration made it more difficult to match children with conservatives.
Traditionally, most conservatives are also the same migrants without travel documents and are afraid to come out and ask for a child and thus endanger their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk was introduced in June when the federal authorities announced that the powerful conservatives and other adult members of their household should give fingerprints and that the data would be notified to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, senior servant of the Immigration and Customs Service, told Congress that the service had arrested dozens of people who were asked to maintain unaccompanied minors.
Later, the service confirmed that 70 percent of the prisoners had a white criminal record.
"Approximately 80 per cent of those who are either conservatives or members of the conservatives' household are in the country illegally and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
We therefore continue to pursue these people," said Mr Albens.
In order to speed up the handling of children's cases, responsible persons have introduced new rules according to which some of these children should appear before a court within one month of the commencement of their detention and not within 60 days, as previously applicable, in accordance with refugee workers.
Many will appear through an icono-trailer, in the position of the person of appearance, in order to develop their claims for a legal regime before the judge responsible for immigration.
Those who consider that they do not meet the conditions for exemption will be removed immediately.
The more children remain in detention, the more likely they are to get upset or become depressed, which may lead to violent outbursts or withdrawal attempts, according to workers in shelters and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Co-workers said that these concerns are increasing in larger facilities such as Turnigio, where the indications that a child is difficult are more likely not to be understood due to the size of the facilities.
They added that moving children to the theater without giving enough time to prepare children psychologically or to say goodbye to their friends can exacerbate the injury they are already fighting with.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish "powers of possession" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Weilid al-Mualem also called on the Syrian refugees to return to their homeland, although the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Mualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegal in Syrian territory, in the cause of the fight against terrorism and "will receive appropriate treatment."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Mualem added that "war on terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions of others have been expelled from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "give this sacred war to all Syrian terrorists" and from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, which primarily educate and inform both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs opposed to President Basar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the territory of the war-damaged country.
With regard to the refugee issue, Mualem said that the conditions are good for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "dispersing extraordinarily fear" which moved refugees to stay away from their country.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're policing a matter that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be granted for the reconstruction of Syria unless a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
The UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on creating a detachmented zone in the last major wave of rebels in Intlib created an opportunity to promote political debates.
The Russian agreement has allowed an extensive attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Mualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military actions would target gypsies, including warriors from the Al-Qaeda-Metopo Nusra connection, who would "be disarmed".
UN Special Envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes to convene shortly the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition to the formation of a post-war Constitution for Syria and to prepare the way for elections.
Mualem laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the committee should be limited "in the revision of the articles of the current Constitution" and warned that no intervention should be made.
Because Trab will win a second term
In this sense, Mr Trab will win the 2020 elections again, unless, as many liberal observers probably hope, the motion for a vote and scandals end his presidency early.
There is no doubt that it would be "the most dramatic presidential final of all times!"
So far, there is no indication of the performers' fatigue.
Since 2014, television numbers in the high-television area have been overcompensated, reaching 1.05 million in the CNN and nearly tripled, reaching 1.6 million in the MSNBC.
The Fox News TV network has an average of 2.4 million TV players in the high TV area, while four years ago it had 1.7 million, according to Nielsen and the MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" broadcast has cut TV numbers into satellite TV, with 3.5 million TVs in the evenings of important news.
It's a fire that people are attracted to because it's something we don't understand," said Neil Bayer, a producer of the drama series ABC "Designed Survivor" where a minister becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Skowell, a veteran comic series writer and book writer entitled "Just the Funny Parts: And a Five Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has a different theory.
A taxi trip is remembered in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trab.
He asked, "Why?"
"He answered "Because it makes me laugh," Mrs. Scowell told me.
You can even have fun with the chaos.
Of course, contrary to what happens to the television series, the scenarios coming out of Washington can judge the future of the Roy v. Wade case, if the immigrant families can reunite the world economy.
The change in frequency is a luxury that only the most privileged TV players can enjoy.
And yet, you go beyond the definition of the informed citizen when you're six hours away to watch a team of specialists discuss the use of "many interviews in the audience" by Bob Woodward for the book "Fear", Paul Manaford's bomber jacket of $15,000 worth of strawberry skin ("a dress full of tops", according to Washington Post) and the consequences of the fine descriptions by St. Daniels about Mr. Trabb's anatomy.
I, however, will never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"What he does and gives you the feeling of the reality of show is he gives you something every night," said Brad Montgomery, the director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the Pawn Stars TV program, about the constantly changing actors and the daily reverses of the Trab show (starts fighting with N.F.L., blames Kim Young Own).
You don't have the luxury of losing an accident, otherwise you stay back.
When I met Mr. Flais this week, it was a sunny day with 26 degrees Celsius outside his house on the northern coast of Hawaii, but he was locked in looking at MSNBC while he was magnetizing CNN.
He couldn't unravel it, not when Brett Kavano was about to appear before the jury's judicial committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was hung by a locker.
"I remember doing those crazy shows in the past, and the world said, "This will mean the beginning of the end of Western culture," said Mr. Flais.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right at last."

Foreign money enters the most limited measurement for the intermediate elections
It is not surprising that the 17th Pensilvania electoral region in Congress accepts a cash flow, thanks to the re-directing of the electoral regions in Congress, which has put two members of Congress candidates in action for the same position.
This recently redesigned Prehistoric Region of Pittsburgh is represented by Democratic Representative Connor Lamb, who was elected to another region in special elections held this morning.
Lamb has another active representative, Repubblica Chith Rothphos, representing the former 12th electoral region of Pennsylvania, which is largely associated with the new 17th electoral region.
The maps were redesigned following a decision of the Pensilvania High Court, which in January found that the old regions were being handled in an anti-substantial manner for the benefit of the Republicans.
The electoral remeasurement in the new 17th electoral region sparked a financial competition campaign between the major financial units of the parties, the Commission of the Republic of Congress (DCCC) and the Committee of the National Republic of the Republic of Korea (NRCC).
Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after winning a final victory in a special election scale held in March, for the 18th election region of Pennsylvania in Congress, which was followed by a great crowd.
This position was held by Republicans for over a decade and President Donald Trab won the region for 20 degrees.
Political analysts give a brief lead to the Republicans.
The United States considered the possibility of punishing El Salvador for his support in China, but they did it back.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, causing mild reactions from Washington.
Mr. Trab had a warm meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and was maintaining a hotel in Panama until the partners withdrew the management team of the Trab Agency.
State Department officials have decided to revoke the US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "the recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan", as Hader Nawert, a representative of the type of service said earlier this month.
However, the imposition of sanctions was considered only against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received approximately US$ 140 million as US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in economic aid and targeted restrictions on passenger visas, would be detrimental to the country of Central America, with high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings developed, North and Central American officials held a high-level conference focusing on security and economic well-being, as a follow-up to a respective concentration that took place last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent the transition of refugees to the United States.
However, in mid-September, the top executives made it clear that they wanted to move forward to the conference, putting an end to the thoughts of sanctions in El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pens is going to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, in the light of the importance of the meeting for the administration, as the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic in peace, without any new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal consultations, subject to anonymity.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst near the administration, who also spoke on the subject of anonymity.
Read History
The next blow may be the report by Mr Trab's Special Council, Robert Miller, on the undermining of justice, for which very strong evidence has now been published.
It is claimed that Mr Miller is also turning his research into possible co-operation between Mr Trab's pre-election campaign and Russia with regard to the Russian attack on our elections.
If Congress changes its hands, Mr Trab will find an account before this body, as he prepares to re-elect the presidency in the next elections and perhaps finally before the Court of Justice.
The 'yes' is a lot and I do not suspect that Mr Trab's fall, or his pledges in Europe, is inevitable.
There are options we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will judge the course of this war.
In 1938 German officials were ready to practice against Hitler, if his West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We managed and lost the chance to avoid the years of killing that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the inseparable course of democracy accelerates or slows down.
The Americans are now faced with enough of these turning points.
What would we do if Mr. Trab fired Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man holding in his hands the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since it was written in that newspaper that he proposed to be secretly recorded by the president and that he considered him inappropriate for the president's position.
Mr Rosenstein said that the issue adopted by the Times was an adjudication.
"How will we respond if the recently requested F.B.I. investigation into Brett Kavano is not complete or fair or is appointed to the Supreme Court in spite of the basic charges for sexual assault and false accusation?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections on a Congress that will put Mr. Trab's account?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will enter a long winter.
But because of the lesson I took in the Act, I don't think we're going to fail.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was transferred to Auschwitz from the same Nazi regime she had once taken to my boarding house.
He survived, moved to America, and 60 years later sent me to set up a candle on a Jewish Saturday at that table with the swastika.
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorans of Rangers is eager for the battle with Rafid Vinenis
The Rangers welcomes Rafid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, after the impressive expedition to Spain with Venezuela earlier this month, will give her a lot of opportunities to protect from the 7th European League Group.
A knee injury has prevented Graham Dorans from making his first appearance in the season until a 2-2 football match with Bijaral, but he believes that Rangers can use this result as an asset for greater success.
"It was a good time for us because Violet is a good team," said 31-year-old.
"We went to the game believing that we could achieve something and we got to a degree.
We might be able to escape in the end, but, in general, the island was a rather fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
Now, Thursday is another great European night.
Well in fact, we can take three degrees, but it will be a difficult game because they brought good results to their last game, but, with the world on the stage, I'm sure we can put our strengths and bring a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult because of my injuries and the changes that happened in the group itself, but there is a positive feeling now.
The team is good, and the kids enjoy it, the training is good.
Let us hope that we will be able to put our strengths now, leave behind the last season and succeed."
Women lose sleep because of their fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the research participants had a clear idea of how they would like to be cared for, few discussed it with their family.
Almost half of the participants in the nationwide research said they were discussing with their spouses the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it to their children.
"People want to take care of their families, but they don't take the initiative to engage in the relevant debate," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Company.
Start with this.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes much earlier.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will be taken care of, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor may also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your financial options for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance at purchase price to help you cover these costs or safety with your own property - enough to have the money.
Write your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes.
Make sure that healthcare professionals comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate with a trusted person.
Also, collect the possibility to make an indemnity for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make decisions on economic matters on your part and ensure that your accounts are paid, if you become unscrupulous.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is facing an emergency health problem and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please refer these details to a written plan to be ready.
"It's not just the economics, but who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make sure you prepare this plan."
Andras received multiple guns with a gun at Ilfracob
A man took several guns with a gun as he walked to his house last night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracob in the county of Devon, when he received gunshots in his chest, chest and arm.
The police described the event, which took place at 02:30 British Tuesday, as "a coincidence".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries he suffered are not dangerous for his life, and the police are calling for witnesses.
Compositions and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a strong earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palus on Friday, according to official sources, while the number of victims is expected to increase.
With the communications being interrupted, humanitarian aid forces have failed to receive information from Dongala, a region in the north of Palus, which is closer to the centre of the 7.5-degree crisis.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were removed after the destruction.
The following are some important information about Palou and Dongala, in the island of Sulawezi:
Palou is the capital of the province of central Sulawezi, located at the edge of a narrow valley on the west coast of the island of Sulawezi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit it.
Dongala is an anti-Kingdom that extends over 300 kilometers (180 miles) of coastline in the southwestern part of the island of Sulawezi.
The anti-Kingdom, a level of administrative division under the province, had estimated the population of 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture constitute the main support for the economy of the province of central Sulawezi, and especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but it meets more in Morowali, on the opposite side of Sulawezy.
Palou and Dongala have been hit by tsunami several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indian Disaster Reduction Service.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
Tsunami also hit West Dongala in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Seismic Firefight in the Pacific Ocean and is often affected by earthquakes.
Some of the largest recent earthquakes and tsunamis are the following:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indian coast in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, while over half were in the coast.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra at the end of May and at the beginning of April.
Hundreds of dead in the Niya Island, near the coast of Sumatra.

Sarah Pilein's firstborn son was arrested for domestic violence.
Trak Pilein, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for the presidency Sarah Pilein was arrested for assault.
The 29-year-old Pailin, from the Alaskan Basil, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence, prevention of complaints of domestic violence and opposition to the principle, according to the report published on Saturday by the police (Alaska State Troopers).
According to the police report, when a known woman tried to call the police to report the crimes she had committed, she grabbed the phone from her hands.
Pilein is temporarily held in the Mat-Su temporary reservation store, with a guarantee of $500, as mentioned at the KTUU TV station.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he said "sure, innocent" when he asked, as the network says.
Pilein faces charges for three charges of category A, which means he can be sentenced to imprisonment for up to a year and a financial penalty of $250,000.
It is also classified as a class A flood, punishable by a day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time you've had a criminal case against Pileen.
In December 2017, he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Pelin.
His mother, Sarah Pilein, called the police to report the attack.
The case has now been brought before the Court of Justice of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of preventing complaints of domestic violence and of the possession of weapons, while he was in a middle state.
His partner claimed to have stabbed her to the face.
Sarah Pilein was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 when she associated her son’s violent behavior with a transformational anxiety disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Seism and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people lost their lives after a earthquake hit the island of Sulawezy in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, while the number of dead is expected to rise the following days.
The earthquake hit the central Sulauezi, located north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
In social media, video is broadcast from the time of the disaster.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a party on the beach in the city of Palau when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Ask for a Splendid Death Penalty for the Suspect of the Terrorist Attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for a death penalty in Saifolo Saipoff, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that cost eight lives - a rare punishment that has been imposed on the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipoff, 30 years old, is brought to use a rental truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a West Side bus along the Lower Manhattan bus, diverting passengers and bicycles found on his way on October 31st.
In order to justify the death sentence, the prosecutors should prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "on purpose" and caused serious bodily harm "on purpose", according to a declaration of intent to impose the death penalty, which was filed in the Court of Justice of the Southern Region of New York.
Both of these categories attack the death penalty, according to the document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal corporation brought Saipov against the 22-point category, which included eight categories of murder against a criminal organization, a regular practice often applied by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases and a category of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and prosecuting" the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov completed the attack as "hard, hard and bad."
"Saifolo Hamboulaevic Saipoff caused damage, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Clives, An-Lor Decand, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferutchi, Ernan Diego Mentosa and Alejandro Damian Panuko", as mentioned in the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been decades since the Court of Justice of the South New York Region filed an appeal for a death penalty case.
The accused, Halid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but finally he was sentenced to death in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was imposed for a federal case in New York was in 1953 in the spouses Julius and Edel Rosenberg, who were executed after being sentenced for conspiracy against the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The two Rosenbergs were performed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Shaipoff, a Uzbek resident, appeared to be indifferent to the days and months that followed the attack, according to court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt satisfied with his operation, according to the police.
Saipoff told the authorities that he was inspired to complete the ISIS video attack that he saw on his cell phone, according to the charge.
He also asked to put the ISIS sign in his hospital room, according to the police.
He declared innocent for the 22 categories listed in the category.
David Patton, one of the federal public advisors representing Shaipoff, said they were "evidently disappointed" with the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to impose a death penalty rather than the acceptance of the declaration of immunity for equal detention with no possibility of detention will simply prolong the injury caused by the events for all those involved," Paton said.
Saipoff's defence team had previously asked the prosecutors not to apply for a death penalty.
Mr Toris said that NAITZEL FARATZ should be chaired by the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Faraz vowed to "mobilize the People's Army" today during a protest at the Torres Conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said that politicians should "sympathize" with the Eurospectors, as one of Teresa May's Members said that he should be the head of the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bowe told protesters in Bermigham that the United Kingdom would "have already come out" so far if Mr Faraz was the responsible minister for Brexit.
But the challenge that Mrs May is facing in her attempt to reconcile the deeply divided Members of the European Union has been underlined by the fact that refugees in the EU in Toris participated in a separate concentration of protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep the Chekers compromise plan under control through attacks by Brexit rebels, EU and EU survivors.
The Allies continued to move forward with their efforts to reach agreement with Brussels, despite the reactions and to force Eurospectors and Workers to choose between its package and the "chaos".
Mr. Bowen said at the Leave Means Leave (Decision means Deviation) protest meeting in Solighal that he wanted to fly the "Checker's plan".
He said that he should have been granted a title of grace to Mr Faraz and that he had been given powers for negotiations with Brussels.
"If we were chief, we'd have gone now," he said.
The Weilingboro MP added, "I will support Brexit, but we must fly the Chekers project."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to become subjects.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr. Bowen rejected the claims that the common opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The saying that the British people have changed their opinion and wants to stay is totally wrong."
Brexit's Prime Minister Andrea Jenkins was also present at the event and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chekers project does not have the broad public acceptance, the opposition is not going to vote on it, does not have the acceptance of our party and our activists who come down to the streets and below elect us.
Please leave the Chekers plan and start listening."
With a strong message to Mrs May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Faraz said at the protest meeting that politicians should be required to "feel pressure" if they are prepared to deliver the decision taken by the 2016 referendum.
"There is now a question of trust between us - the people - and the order of our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them "we won't let you get rid of it if you do that."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make the order of our politicians, who are ready to betray Brexit, to feel pressure.
"We move the people's army of this country that has given us the victory with Brexit and we will never be satisfied until we become an independent, dominant and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the EU's supporters protested in Bermigham before they conducted a two-way concentration in the city centre.
A few activists mixed the Torah against Brexit with the group this weekend.
The Minister of Labour of Lord Adonis closed the Conservatives because of the security issues they dealt with with with an application of the party at the beginning of the meeting.
"They are the same people who tell us that they can put in place the information systems and all the technological means needed for the EU-type agreement – Canada with wealth, for the unlimited borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete fiasco.
It doesn't mean a good Brexit." He added.
Warren plans to take seriously the possibility of applying for the presidency.
The US Secretary-General, Elizabeth Warren, said he would seriously consider applying for the presidency after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the governor of the Republics from Massachusetts spoke about her future plans during a meeting in the capital of Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who often criticises President Donald Trab, announced his re-election in November, against the Republican representative of the state of Jeff Dil, who co-chaired the Trab campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is strongly claimed that it can be measured with the Trab in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters, using the city hall structures since the day the Krab began.
A visitor to the meeting asked her if she was planning to apply for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come "to go to Washington women to build our dissolved government, and that means that a woman must be at the top."
Arrest for the deadly shooting of LSU Sims
The police in Baton Rose of Los Angeles announced on Saturday the arrest of a suspect for the deadly shooting of LSU Wade Sims' gunman on Friday.
Baton Rose's police department announced Deton Sibson's arrest, 20 years old, in a type interview at 11mm (Austral Zone).
They had published a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying the man who appeared in the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot fatally near the University of Southern University early on Friday.
"Wide Sims suffered a bullet wound in his head, leading to his death," police chief Merfi J. Paul said in the media on Saturday, according to the 247sports website.
Wade invested to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was discovered and admitted to being found at the point of possession of the gun and confessed to shooting Wade Sims.
Simson was arrested without resisting and detained in the Police Department of the Eastern Baton Rose Congregation.
Three-year-old Sims, who grew up in Baton Rose, played in 32 matches, with 10 appearances as a main player in the last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 ribands per race.
Grand Pri of Russia: Lewis Hamilton goes for a world title, as the group's instructions gave him the victory over Sebastian Fedel
It became clear from the time Valteri Botas went before Louis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the game.
In the afternoon, Botas had a good start and almost hung Hamilton, as he defended his position in the first two turns and called on Fedel to attack his stand.
Fedel went first to the pit and let Hamilton run in the race's ear, which should be decisive.
Mercedes went to the pit one round and came back from the Fedel, but Hamilton came out after a wheeled battle, which forced Ferrari's driver to unintentionally abandon the internal risk of violating the dual movement in order to defend the third corner.
Max Ferstopen started his last post and was seventh at the end of the first round of his 21st birthdays.
He then remained first for a large part of the race, holding his sticks to end quickly and to pass before Kimmy Ryconen in fourth place.
He finally went to the pits at the 44th round, but he couldn't increase his speed to the remaining eight rounds, as Raymond came fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valteri was fantastic all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team went great and did the one-two," Hamilton said.
The language of the body was very bad
President Donald Trab closed Senator Diane Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday to insist that he did not interrupt Christine Blazey Ford's letter, in which he accused the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bret Cavano for sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to the submission submitted by Ford before the Committee on Judicial Affairs of Georgia, commenting on the fact that those held in Georgia proved that people are "unsuitable and ridiculous and false."
"The only thing that could happen is this beautiful thing that happens in the last days in the Senate, where you see anger, you see people who are angry and ugly and ridiculous and lying," he said.
"When you see publications and leaks and then they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
-Dajan Finnstein, did you make the leak?
Remember her answer... you interrupted the document - "oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't break it."
Well, wait a minute.
If we broke... no, we didn't break," added the mayor.
Feinstein received Ford's letter containing details of the charges against Kawan in July and she passed through earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the breakout was made by her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't break her story," Fiinstein told the committee, as reported in Hill's paper.
"He asked me to keep her secret, and I kept her secret as he asked."
But her refusal did not appear to be particularly evident to the president, who commented during the meeting on Saturday: "I will tell you something, the language of the body was very bad.
He may not have done it, but it was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
In continuing to defend the motion for a Supreme Court, which was accused of three women for sexual harassment, the president suggested that the Republicans use the charges to serve their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power using any necessary means.
You see wickedness, sport, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to walk to take power and control," the president said according to the Mediaite news website.
Elit Lig: Danny Storrs 5-3 Belfast Jiands
Patrick Duyer put two bullets for the Jades against Danny.
Danny Storrs took an appeal for her fate in the Friday match at Elite Lig from Belfast Jaunds, winning the 5-3 win on Saturday.
The Giants took an easy two-ball run with Patrick Doyer and Francis Bowieer's suite.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cauny brought the plains to the ground before Doier brought back the Giants' advance.
François Busar gave Dante a tip and then two bullets from Lucas Ludwald Nielsen secured the team's victory.
It was the third time in Elit Lig in the season for Adam Kiff's men, who were winning 2-1 on Dandy in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two groups, with the Jades, that they won the last three matches.
Doier opened the score in the fourth minute at 3:35 with Kental McFol's assistant, while David Rutherford gave the assistant a favor to which Boviger doubled the performance four minutes later.
In a fruitful period of full action, Sullivan put the field team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Markward gave the help to the equation from Cauny at 15:16.
Doier secured the twins' advance in the first half of the year when he made his second goal for the night at the end of the first period.
The group of the peasants was reorganized and Busar re-evaluated with a bullet showing power at 27:37.
Cauny and Charles Corcoran joined their forces to help Nielsen give the lead in Danny for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, and he won the win with his team's fifth ball in the last period.
The Giants, who have lost in four of the last five games, are playing in their seats with Milton Kanes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller loses his life to free hundreds of aircraft from earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is declared a hero, losing his life in his attempt to secure the safe take-off of a plane that carried hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed and many were ignored because of a big earthquake that struck the island of Sulawezi on Friday, causing tsunamis.
Strong migrations continue to impact the region, and many have been trapped in riots in the city of Palau.
However, while his colleagues were trying to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gonnauan Angung refused to leave his position at the checkpoint that was being held, at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palo.
It remained in its position to ensure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the take-off route at that time, could safely land.
Then he jumped off the checkpoint when he thought it was broken.
He died at the hospital later.
Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirett, said that this decision could save hundreds of lives, as the ABC News TV network broadcasts.
We prepared a helicopter from Balicapaan to Calimadan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before he got to the Palo helicopter.
"We're obsessed with his death," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid that the dead may be thousands, while the country's disaster management service reports that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"The number of the dead is believed to increase further, as many bodies are still under the deficits, and many of these we have not managed to achieve," said the service type representative, Sutopo Puro Nugroho.
The waves that reached the six measures destroyed the Palace, which will complete a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Rosa Kuzuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute a patient brings bodies.
Clean water's a little bit.
The mini-markets are all over the place."
Jean-Gelfand, president of the International Red Star in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Star is struggling to save survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
What has happened is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse."
Indonesia's President Joe Weidondo arrived in Palou on Sunday and said to the country's army: "I ask you to work nightly to complete any work related to the decommissioning.
Are you ready?' handed over the CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, which cost more than 550 people their lives.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is missing after the crash of a ship on a lake
The airline flying in a Pacific port in Micronesia now reports that a man is missing, and earlier it said that the 47 passengers and crew members had safely evacuated the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini in a type paper said that since Saturday afternoon it is not able to find the traces of a man's passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to identify the man.
The air carrier did not respond directly to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Ships of the region helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as he was trying to land at the island of Tsuk.
The authorities said Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were staying at the hospital on Saturday and all of them were stable.
The causes of the conflict and the exact compatibility of the facts remain unclear.
The air carrier and the U.S. Navy said the plane crashed at the port outside the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane went down very low.
"That's very good," said Janes.
Janes said that he and others managed to move through the water that reached them as the means to the emergency escape exits of the sinking plane.
He said the airports had panicked and called and himself had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that some sailors working there close to improving a sailboat also helped rescue by using a flashing boat to transport people to the sea before sinking the ship to about 30 metres (100 feet).
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people have lost their lives in air carriers conflicts registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but Air Niguini was not involved in any of these conflicts.
An analyst sets out the time of night when a woman was kept alive
The accused authority completed her purchase on Saturday in a man's retrial indicted that in 2014 she burned alive a woman from Mississippi.
The U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Roullet has spent hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
She explained to the jury how she used mobile phone records to line up the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Roulette said she received location files from various mobile phones that showed that Teles was with Chambers on the night of her death, renouncing his previous claims, as stated in the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber's cell phone the time it claimed was with Michael Sanford's friend, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford sat down as a witness on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked him if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said, "He was lying, because my truck was in Nasville."
Another argument was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Mobile records showed that they were only known for a week.
Roulette said that sometime after the death of Chambers, Tellis posted the messages, calls and contact details of Chambers on his phone.
"He wrote her out of his life," Heil said.
Defence is about to begin its purchase on Sunday.
The judge said he appreciated that later that day the trial would be brought to trial by the debtors.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A hippop three wants to question the negative view of the species, filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that the hip hop has escaped its roots, which were political messages and dealing with social issues.
They want to go back to his roots and make the conscious hip hip again popular.
Artists such as Fugees and Commons experience a recent recovery in the United Kingdom through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
And another black?
Danta in New York is texting a couple who fired her after receiving a "racist" message.
A New York Dating treats a couple for racist dissolution after receiving a message that was mistakenly sent to her by her mother where the last one complained that the Dating was "another black man."
The couple refuse to be racist, like treatment with "exhaustion".
Linsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, was disappointed when it was realized that the new Dante Giel Morris was black, just the last one showed up for her first day at work in 2016.
Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mr Morris twice.
As soon as she realized her jacket, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman now released Mrs. Moris, saying that their missing date, which was from Africa, had not done any good work and waited in her position for a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Mr Morris received a salary for her one and only day of work and was then sent home with Uber.
Now, Mrs. Morris has been treating the couple for compensation for the discharge and is making compensation for the $350 class on the day for the half-time work as an internal dand, for which she was originally hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show them that, look, you can't do such things," he told Post on Friday, and added, "I know it's a discriminating treatment."
The couple objected to the claims that they were racist, saying that it was reasonable to fire Morris, as they feared that they could not trust her once again.
"My husband sent her something she didn't want to send.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco's husband told Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've offended, even mistakenly?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Like treatment with "exemption," Plasco said his wife had just been born two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Would you hunt someone who's in this situation?
It's not that kind" the bank investor added.
While the legal case is in progress, the court of common opinion has insisted on condemning the couple in social media, condemning them for their behaviour and reasoning.
Paddington’s publishers were afraid that readers would not be interested in a boy speaking, as revealed in a new letter.
Bod's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to get into the position of someone who read it for the first time before his release.
It's a lot of fun when you know what we know now about the tremendous success of Pentagon."
He said that her father, who worked as an iconic at the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book by a fat boy, was curious about his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "glucopic", as her father left his life last year.
Regarding Pantington, which he describes as "a very important member of the family", he added that her father was secretly proud of his subsequent success.
"He was a pretty quiet man and he wasn't a superhero," he said.
"But because Pantington was so real in his eyes, it was almost like having a child who can do something: you're proud of it even if it's not your own ability to do it.
I think that's how he looked at the success of Paddington.
Although it was a creation of his own and of his imagination, he always gave the stamps to Pantingon himself."
My daughter died and I had to tell her goodbye to the phone.
After her arrival, her daughter was transferred to the hospital in Nices Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried to escape to save her life.
"Nand was calling all the time and telling me it was very bad, that he had not much hope of success," said Mrs. Adnan-Laperuz.
"Sometimes Nand called me to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tai, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be near you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors had given her to keep her heart alive were gradually diminishing and getting out of her body.
He was already dead a few hours ago and that time and now they're all sinking.
I had to just sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream, cry, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to stay cold."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperuz, who has so far believed in the loss of her daughter, was on the plane with the other passengers who were ignoring the test she was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I had my head down and they were bleeding all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane, a feeling of compassion for Nand came at me.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Women who pass the loss of their own persons hang cards on the bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide are trying to prevent other people from taking their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfreis hang on a bridge in Wales with funny messages and phone numbers that they can call to get support.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I feel every day," he said.
45-year-old Mr. Davis, who lives in Lindney, said her son was a very promising chef with a portable smile.
"They all knew him thanks to his smile.
They always said his smile was lighting the room."
However, he quit his job before he died, as he was in a very bad situation.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he had ended his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm pretty worried there's gonna be an impact."
Mr. Davis created the cards "to inform the world that there are people out there to whom you can go and talk, even if they are your friends.
Don't stay silent - you need to talk."
Mrs. Hamfreis, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old companion, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt hurt or depressed or something," he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we observed a change in his behavior.
He was stuck on Christmas day - when the kids opened their gifts, he didn't look them in the eyes."
He said his death caused them a huge injury, but they had to overcome it, "He's breaking up the family.
It's bothering us.
But we must all continue and fight."

Brett Kavano's future is uncertain, as the FBI is starting to investigate.
"I thought that if we could really achieve something like what he was asking for - a limited length and limited object research - we might be able to bring some unity," said Mr. Fleic on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be dissolved through broken partial outputs.
Why didn't Mr. Kavano and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
Their unwillingness is entirely due to the time continuum.
The interim elections are only in five weeks, on 6 November, and if the Republicans are expected not to do so well, they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to achieve the election of the person who wants to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George Walker Bus calls the Mayors, forcing them to support Mr. Kawano, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bus and through him met his wife Asley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI report is presented?
A vote will be taken in the Parliament, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Republicans.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavano can take at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would enable Mike Pens, the vice-president, to take the majority and ensure his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korea's envoys falls under Kim's authority
The number of deputies from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Young Won came into power seven years ago, according to a South Korea legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, providing data from the South Korea Mining Ministry, said that 1,127 distances were observed last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the strictest border controls between North Korea and China and the higher charges on mobile persons were key factors.
Pyongyang hasn't made any public comments.
In the overwhelming majority of the resignations from North Korea, the Republic of South Korea is finally offered.
Seoul reports that over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them escape through China, which has the largest borders with North Korea, which are easier to cross than the heavy-protected Destructed Zone between North and South Korea.
China considers illegal immigrants to be refugees rather than refugees and often exonerates them through violence.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is typically still in war, has been significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier in the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Piunjiang to discuss the nuclear negotiations, which have been delayed.
This meeting came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trab and Kim Young Oun in Singapore, where they agreed to cooperate with their conditions for the depuration of the Korean landscape.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Rim Jong Il accused the US of missing progress ever since.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these conditions, in no case will we disarm our country alone first," said Mr. Rim in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelozy calls Brett Kavano "sister", says he's inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court
The Democratic President of the Council of Representatives Nancy Pelozy called on the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kavano to "sister" and said he was out of self-esteem to serve the Supreme Court.
Pelozy made these comments at a Saturday conference at the Texas Tribune Festival in East Texas.
"I could only think that if a woman acted in this way, she would be called "sistery," Pelozy commented on the Kawan's submission to the Committee on Jurisdiction on Thursday.
Kavano, with a strong urge, denied the charges that he had committed a sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blaze Ford when he was both teenagers.
During his successful purchase, Kavano was deeply moved, sometimes almost called, and his voice was as we talked about his family and his school years.
He also strongly condemned the Republicans on the committee, characterizing the charges against him as a "terrestrial and coordinated political murder" organised by liberals who have remembered Hillary Clinton's fate in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelozy said he believed that Kavano's claim proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as he showed that he was pre-deposited against the Republicans.
"I think that he himself has ruled out himself with these statements and with the way he has succeeded against the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelozy responded when asked if he would try to protest against Kavano if his appointment was confirmed and if the Republicans would get the majority in the Parliament of Representatives.
"I will say this - if he does not tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, then he is not only suitable for the Supreme Court, but also for the court at which he is currently serving," Pelozy said.
Kawano is a judge in the Regional Court of Appeals of the District of Colombia (D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals).
Pelozy added that, as a Republican, he was concerned about the possible decisions of the Kavano regarding the Law on Affordable Care Act or the Roy v. Wade case, as a conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm his appointment, Kabano failed to answer questions as to whether he would comply with certain decisions of the High Court.
"Isn't it time to go to court a funny, prejudiced man and wait to say "isn't that great?" said Pelozy.
And women must have it in their possession.
It's a justified explosion, months and years of anger are gone, and it can't get out of it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem said 45 years later.
"I don't find it unusual, do you?"
He went on to say, "It helped me a lot, a woman who was an expert somewhere, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but had developed a technique according to which when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm upset because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And so he just kept going.
And it seemed great to me."
The tears are allowed as a burst of anger in part because they are basically misunderstandings.
One of my deepest memories of a job I've done before, in a office where men were ruling, is once I cried with sudden anger and got me a bigger woman out of my neck -- a cold manager I've always been afraid of -- and he dragged me on a ladder.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're fired.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they broke it to you."
Patricia Srender, then Democratic Governor of Colorado, had cooperated with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart got caught up in an out-of-court relationship with a ship called Monkey Business (Bromodula) and abandoned the humble struggle, Mrs. Srender, deeply disappointed, thought that there was no reason not to consider the idea of putting the same candidate for the presidency.
"It wasn't such a wise decision," he said, laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone described the situation as "The Snow and the Seven Nails."
Because the campaign had already begun for a long time, it was back in funding and so it was sworn that it would not be in the race of elections if it had not collected $2 million.
The war was lost.
He discovered that some of her supporters gave $1,000 to men, only $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" he asked.
In her speech in which she announced that she would not start an official campaign, she was very strongly charged with feelings - gratitude for the people who supported her, disappointment with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than for representatives and anger with sexism - who felt a lot in the neck.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs Srender recalls about the type's reactions to her.
"You'd think Kleinex was my partner.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my carpet?
"Scream"?
How the trade war between the US and China can do good in Beijing
Welcomed by the US-China trade-war uniforms, and while the war still has a lot to finish, a gap between the two countries can benefit for the long-term Beijing, experts say.
American President Donald Trab threw the first warning shot earlier this year, taxing basic Chinese exportable products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week, the biggest undercutting has evolved by imposing new tariffs on US$200 million ($150 million) in the form of a tax of half of all US imports from China.
Beijing returns the fires to species every time, while recently it has imposed a duty of between five and ten percent on goods worth 60 million dollars.
China is determined to respond to American fires and the second largest economy in the world is not likely to put it down soon.
In order to succeed in making Washington go down, he must comply with their demands, but publicly calling in the United States would be too embarrassing for Si Jinping, the President of China.
But, according to experts, if Beijing could play its cards correctly, American pressures in the context of the trade war could be positive for China for a long time with the reduction of interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic collapse in any of the two countries is in fact much more dangerous than the observers in the past have admitted," said Abigail Grace, a research partner with a study centre in Asia, at the Center for New American Security, a thought-set.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, according to the Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be ready for the arbitrary return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding the seven-year-old (and now) war of the country.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Weilid Al Mualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore regularity.
All the conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to be abandoned because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war broke out in 2011.
The other six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian help.
Al Mualem said the aid to rebuild the damaged country is welcome by the Syrian government.
However, he stressed that he would not accept aid under conditions or aid from countries supporting the uprising.
Europe locks victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Riyadh Cup 2018, winning the US team with a final score of 16.5 versus 10.5 in the Gulf of Le Golf National, outside Paris in France.
The American team has now been deployed 6 consecutive times in European territory and has been winning the Cup of Rainer in Europe since 1993.
Europe again took the lead, as the Danish leader Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The star of the U.S. Phil Michelston team, who fought hard during the major tournament, threw his shot into the water at the par-3 16th hole, giving victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian player of Golf Molinari was missing in all its rounds, and so it became 1 of the 4 players that achieved 5-0-0 since the current form of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit was defeated at 5&4 by the lowest in the ranking player of the European team, Dano Thorbjorn Olsen.
The player with the best ranking in the world, Dustin Johnson, won 2 and 1 against Ian Powder from England, who can play his last game at Küpello Raider.
The Spanish veteran eight Cypella Rainer, Sergio Garcia, was the most successful European of all times in the tournament with a total of 25.5 degrees.
"Of course I don't cry, but today I can't hold.
It was a difficult year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we got the doll back.
It's all for the team and I'm glad I was able to help," Garcia said excitedly after the European victory.
It gives the dog to John Ram's compatriot, who won the American legend of Golf Tiger Woods 2+1 in an individual game on Sunday.
"I feel incredible surprises that I won Tiger Woods, I grew up to admire this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost his four matches in France, and now he has a career record in Küpello Ryder 13-21-3.
Unusual statistics for one of the biggest players of all times, who has won 14 important titles and has only overrun Jack Nikolaus.
The U.S. team had a hard time finding a goal all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Ridd, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who played a high-level golf course throughout the tournament.
American leader Jim Farick spoke after his group's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these kids, they fought it.
Some moments this morning we pressed enough for Europe.
We fought hard.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a big boss.
And his 12 players played very well.
We will be regrouped, we will work with the US PGA and the Cyber Raider Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 kids and I'm proud to be their leader.
We have to admit it.
They were better than us."
