The Prague Stock Exchange at the end of the market has had a negative impact.
After the crash in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange restored the losses.
Transactions in CEZ actions have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
From the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange took up the day before it was almost 6%.
Behind this bottom there's the stake of the action on Wall Street.
We also see a response from the market to the result of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which has refused to support the plan for the stabilization of the local financial sector.
Crowd of actions in Asia
On Tuesday, the shares of the Asian Stock Exchanges experienced a dramatic shock, although the indices, however, during the day they subsequently cancelled some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange Hang Seng index during the day has cancelled almost 4%, but then also some of the losses stabilizing to 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the Chinese action movement at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8% while the markets in Shanghai were closed.
The shares at the Sydney Stock Exchange were lost more than 5%, but at the end of the losses were estimated at 4.3%.
The Thai-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, fell by 3.6%.
"The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and this will affect financial markets all over the world," observed the head of the Hong Kong currency office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages its own financial policy, so it does not depend on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level in the United States.
American legislators, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should return quickly to the dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
On the other hand, there is a risk that other countries too are suffering from the consequences.
Strague of American action
On Monday, the US Parliament rejected the financial system's support plan, for which $700 billion (about 12 billion Czech crowns) had to be allocated.
The legislators have thus ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the whole economy.
The American actions on Monday lived a street and the main indices of the actions recorded the greatest holocaust from more than twenty.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost 7% and a drop of such sizes was last observed in 1987.
The index was already down before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the draft law was not approved, it went into free fall.
The Congress has given up: the U.S. government can spend 700 billion dollars on banks.
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of economic support for the American financial system.
The vote on this will be at the beginning of next week.
The US legislators have broken the ice in the dialogue on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the US financial system for a total of 700 million dollars (about twelve billion crowns).
But it's not yet said.
The representatives of the Congress, therefore, must define some details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the law and voting it.
The support plan of the financial system will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
Sunday said so to the agency Reuters, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services of the Barney Frank room.
The Senate, according to some sources, could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the economies, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor capable of awakening the financial markets.
Next, however, there will be a return to reality due to the complexity of the mechanisms with which, in practice, to reach the aid of the markets.
Paulson: The Plan must be effective
"We've made a big move forward."
"We have clarified our different views on the form of the presentation of the package for the stabilisation of the market," said democratic Nancy Pelosi to Bloomberg.
According to the same, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
The legislators met on the night between Saturday and Sunday with the US Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give final form to the government's financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire from financial companies non-cedible mortgage assets, which lead financial companies to serious losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
"We are fulfilling the final agreement of the plan which will work and which must also be effective on the market."
"It's still necessary to bring the recovery plan forward, but I think we're there," said Paulson.
The Asian Trade Signal
The global financial crisis is strongly affecting the markets of the actions that are suddenly being rolled out.
According to the democratic senator of Nevada Harry Reid, the legislators are thus trying to reach a final agreement to the Congress even before Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are, in time, the first to influence the Monday market as a result of the Congress's decision.
But for now it is definitely not clear when the two Houses of the American Congress will vote on the law, and even if the negotiations can be stopped at the last moment on some problems.
The legislators hope to be approved in the next few days.
But the law will still make many changes.
The total amount provided for the support of the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars must be available as soon as possible as President George Bush asked.
But Congress can block the balance of the sum in the event that it will be felt that the programme does not perform its function, blocking the next $100 billion dollars and after the final 350.
Bush appreciated progress in the negotiations.
Although the President may vote on this decision, the Congress may exercise its right to vote.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the programme has been maintained, i.e. to obtain the funds to buy passive mortgages, whose price is reduced by hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
"We have developed everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the Sunday law and the Monday Senate," the Republican Senator mentioned.
Progress in the negotiations is also welcomed by US President Bush.
His spokesman Tony Frato said that Bush is pleased with the positive move on Saturday and appreciates "the effort of both parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of gold parachutes
The chairman of the Banking Committee of Senator Christopher Dodd, the chief spokesman, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of the budget for reductions, the fragmentation of the financial plan.
The new law must also limit the so-called gold parachutes for the heads of the companies participating in the programme and is setting up a committee to control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and we have taken a great step forward towards the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and also for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan counts on the aid to homeowners who have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate the new rates of mortgages that it will purchase with the aim of lowering monthly expenditure on the rates for debtors and allowing them to keep their houses.
Mark: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the main economy of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its realization will be very difficult.
"And that's because we don't know how and for what price the problem assets will be bought
This will determine how the financial sector and the government will share the losses between them," Marek said this week for the iHNed.cz website .
Whether the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
"More importantly, it is that this week the representatives of the Congress have reached an agreement on the support of this plan and that they baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is now more important," Marek stressed.
Duello to the last blood: MP3 readers against cells
We'll recommend how to choose
While almost every cell can read MP3 files, no MP3 reader can call.
That makes it clear that it's better to buy just the phone.
Despite this, there are many reasons why you are looking for an autonomous reader.
The choice depends entirely on how to use and the needs of the future owner.
You may find it difficult to buy a expensive high-quality gymnast to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all, these musical products do not serve as LP and from a qualitative point of view for this reason there is no objective reason.
But if on your drawers vinyl hard-rock, jazz or blues vinyls are popping up, a giraffe of the kind as a minimum is dreamy.
It also works with portable music, that is compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
There are also categories of prices and quality here.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend for an 8 thousand crown reader, as well as a Pink Floyd fan may hardly digest the bowls from twenty crowns of the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
To decide is the duration of the batteries.
Some high-quality music players manage to do much more than simply read the music, but what they don't do is not even wrong.
There is no other current device as universal as the cell phone.
Alongside the primary functions, phone and send text messages, you can read music and videos, both record and have a photo machine, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe you can also navigate.
And if we take into account smartphones and palm trees, you will also have a miniature computer.
It's a small miracle because no refrigerator can make the grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the cell also leads to disadvantages.
More functions you use on the cell phone and first the indicator on the screen will require the battery.
And reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few cells can read the music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, the music players (especially the simpler ones) are much more effective.
As far as economic cells are concerned, there is no contact that can last for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from time to time, some calls, look for safety for another battery, this also applies to the most expensive devices.
But you won't have this problem with a MP3 player, even worse ones last at least 9 hours with continuous functionality with a charge.
A further problem arises when you download the music in the cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of devices has the universal USB port and in addition not all can connect to the computer without a special software.
Surely the music can be recorded directly on memory card, but only a few memory readers are able to do it without adapter for minicards that are not used in cells.
Readers, with some exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with the music via USB from the computer.
Most of the cells and readers are created by themselves a multimedia library arranged according to the names of the interpreters, album name, genre or according to the user's classification.
Some devices only reproduce the folder tree structure, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some can do both things (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
The readers are easier to handle, the cells can do more.
When you choose a particular device, you are especially interested in the strength of the battery, memory capacity, quality and type of audio outputs and clearly the ease of use.
If the music serves you especially from the background and if you listen to it every day just briefly on the tram, it will suffice you any cell phone reading MP3.
This can now, clearly at any cell phone.
You don't have to worry too much about which formats the cell phone or reader recognizes.
The MP3 players support them all, the global majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most common ones, the total majority of devices support music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (format used by Apple and its Ipods).
The best cells also allow, for example, to buy online music.
Just visit, through the mobile internet network, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid topic to buy a reader-cell phone.
Unfortunately the offer of operators is poor and is usually limited only to hit at the time of the radio.
Prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this very way of selling music (either via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always wear their cell phone back.
Anyone who wants to listen to some fruit in the bag while the MP3 player remains forgotten at home.
But it also depends on this, if you always bring it behind the lids or at least auricular it without wire.
If not, you can use the integrated player that almost every cell, but only a small part of MP3 readers has.
Maybe the biggest advantage of readers-cells will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3 thousand crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entry for the Common Cuffies.
The best and technically equipped cells, including 3,5 mm for common roofs, cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
Instead, the advantage of the readers is, in addition to others, easy handling.
The simplest not necessarily cheaper (see our choice) makes it really anyone can handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of handling for a time with the common stereo or perhaps the giraffe, is obvious.
There is no danger of mistake in starting the mobile Internet network and as a result of a huge ticket for the transmission of data.
Which device to take
Even the cheapest cells (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD etc.).
Also with regard to the purchase of the respective card, which falls within 2 000 crowns.
But be careful.
The base models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones make it with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and you also want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners you prefer to take the specialized cells - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keys for MP3 and the comfort of the service so you get closer to the same MP3 reader.
In this area, Sony Ericsson has made more roads, which walkman line cells have the same user scale as MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 readers of the above marks provide you with the same service and price category up to 4,000 crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (commonly 15 hours, in line up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic already this year.
Forse
Perhaps the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer virtually all the services as their partners in Western Europe.
There is something missing here – a virtual operator that forces traditional ones to lower the price.
Maybe he won't be missing for a long time.
The fact that the Czech operators belong to the most expensive ones in Europe has already been written many times on Mobil.cz.
Finally, CTU also confirmed it, which noted that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the area of the regulation of roaming tariffs, perhaps a paradosal situation will arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS will cost less than home.
How can prices in the Czech Republic remain so high against Europe?
The answer is simple, lack of competition that would really want to start the fight .
It may sound absurd, even where we have three mobile networks and coverage high above 100 %.
On the contrary, mobile telephony operators like to relax the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, he often stresses also the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (CTU), Pavel Dvořák, who once expressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It may be true that the traditional operator with its network is no longer likely to have many possibilities. (The rest might be difficult to find other frequencies now).
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
It is the entry into the virtual operators market that has led to a significant price reduction, which would then have had to respond to the traditional operators.
At the same time even before the entry of squads like Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile in the market, they sounded similar voices in Britain as we do.
However, it has been shown that there is a place for such operators and that they can really succeed.
At the end of the accounts for the examples, we don't have to go very far.
In February of this year we informed you of the arrival of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator has managed to conquer over 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking is the Penta financial group, which in the Czech Republic belongs between the other U:phone.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete group.
In order to be able to actually operate, that is many less customers than a traditional operator.
They are not behind, i.e. relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators usually present at low cost, offer calls and SMS at low price, which is often in balance with the offer of the most restricted services
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS that cost at least half compared to its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a pretty good move even the bet on a group-bersaille not recently.
This operator points to say so specifically about men.
"The real men choose Mobilking operator that he likes and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether we can say a concept similar to that in Poland.
He questioned the press spokesman for Vodafone Miroslav Čepiký: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition from the point of view of the services, it is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic no possibility, mobile network operators say
But it seems almost certain that if there will never be an operator in the Czech Republic, it won't be the Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this project of success, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations have little expectations.
Mobilking's accent will take place rather in the other countries of our area," said Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
It has thus indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are not very much in favour of this view.
Instead, they try to do everything because you don't believe in any competitive potential.
For a while it does not hide its interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group that would thus take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónika O2 in the business client field.
"We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And first it's better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all the Czech mobile network operators.
We have already made progress in negotiations with some of them," said the spokesman for the Pavel Kaidl group.
So maybe there'll be better times.
Non-official information shows that the first virtual operator must have it by the end of the year.
For now, however, around its creation there is an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At this point, we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a fully-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no subject with a complex and serious project has addressed us," he mentioned in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršenů of the press section of Telefónika O2.
The specificities of the Czech market also apply to other operators.
The spokesman for the T-Mobil print Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with the declaration O2: "For now we have not noticed any vital and beneficial commercial project for both, on which it is possible to continue to build".
And he adds: "In the T-Mobile network, a virtual operator will hardly appear by the end of the year.
We have already had to have a concrete agreement on the table so that it can be viewed as a horizontal one."
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on reaching its 3G licence applications.
Adds Miroslav Čepýk : "We are open to negotiations of potential virtual operators, and this is especially in the context of the sharing of expenditure and infrastructure.
We consider this, from the customer point of view, to be the most producer.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet."
Competent authorities - with complex operators
The attitude of mobile telephony operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thus to a decrease in profit.
Why, then, facilitate the emergence of such a competitor?
The tires around the U:phone creation testify that when the operators have something they can remember from the same side.
Perhaps the heavy pressure pushes against ČTU during the period of U:phone creation towards the company of T-Mobile.
This gives evidence of public access to the website of ČTU.
But right now U:fon serves as a topic for which you don't accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová observed: "The environment of the competition of the mobile telephony market has been little stronger than anything with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the typology of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another competitor would be on him and above all on his advanced high services."
However, the attitude of mobile telephony operators is quite surprising the complete disinterest of the Czech regulators.
It is not just the attitude of the CTU which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other developed countries - has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
This, however, in relation to all the problems, has taken its typical position.
"The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market would be possible after the conclusion of the necessary infrastructure lease contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator has been realized.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers probably wasn't interesting enough for traditional operators," Kristián Chalupa said, the section for external relations ÚOHS, in response to our questionnaire.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators may not be surprising.
On the other hand, the office that must defend the interests of consumers and also take care of the fact that no one takes advantage of its position on the market is more than a delicate matter.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Outside where virtual operators commonly operate, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephony services."
But of course, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices does not belong to the interests of ÚOHS.
Truly shocking in all the situation is the almost exciting harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really only a coincidence is put alone.
Just as the same price of petrol for all petrols is the fruit of the coincidence and competition struggle.
"The section did not find signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this regard and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so it does not have a corresponding greater responsibility for its behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be missing the telecommunication regulator," Chalupa mentioned in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points .
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications is from the point of view of economic competition the single market.
On such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator is always necessary the agreement of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has – at the end of the accounts logically – the monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant by force.
But even if we do not accept this argument, for ÚOHS it should be a minimum warning that three mobile operators are acting in such a strange way.
At the same time, complaints from interested parties (including the mentioned company GTS Novera) show that during negotiations with all operators, there are very similar obstacles.
Dischargeing responsibility in ČTÚ in telecommunications is a fairly common trick with which ÚOHS is kept out of the way.
We have already found this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been able to promote the expansion of CTU's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the updating of the recently approved telecommunications law, despite the fact that many experts were expected to improve the situation from this point of view.
This is done by the representatives of ÚOHS to know more than well, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere.
You can do it, when no one sees
While we do not know how these pseudo-virtual operators operate, some of them even exist in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their price lists of mobile telephony services, but only partially public.
These are usually companies that deal with multi-level marketing.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their mobile telephony services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the people who are expected to.
Magic is in fact that the company against the operator is listed as a classic business client, which orders a large amount of SIM card.
As an important customer then receives special price offers (and so on).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar forecast.
"If the cases you are talking about, of which we will be interested, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions, and it could disappear in the conclusion of the cooperation with that company," answered the question in question Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity would not reach the ears of the persons responsible for mobile telephony operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, thousands of customers may be involved.
No operator defends itself at the same time from such an attitude.
From the activities of these companies they bring an undifferentiated profit and at the same time - unlike true virtual operators - they are not damaged in any way with their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepíký advises on possible problems: "The law allows for similar speculations, however only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
These also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, so they cannot have it in full as usual customers of mobile telephony operators"
But that's exactly what should be a little weird about the CTU.
There is also another issue for ÚOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that ÚOHS has strong enough rights to mask similar activities and, if he does not wish to do so, it is not necessary to agree with the explanation of operators who do not have any idea of this and whose commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we're no more expensive
As has been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile telephony market has led to a significant decrease in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where operators were born, traditional operators tried to prevent their creation more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - the market too small, at the limit too saturated, problems with the quality of services etc.
But in the developed countries, in these cases, the defence regulators were involved, not mobile telephone operators, but their clients.
Both with formal measures and with non-formal pressure, he came to the creation of the first virtual operator and he agreed to others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators launch themselves from one to the other all the way around as a bubble potato.
For our experience we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity in these cases makes him more comfortable than comfortable.
But we don't throw the sponge.
If the backstage information is correct and the virtual operator will really appear to us soon, the Czech mobile telephony market will resume on a motorcycle.
If one of the operators had consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only difficult ÚOHS could remain irreparable to the refusal (discrimination) of the other parties.
And perhaps we will stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech inno has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national inn.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the day of the recognition of the Czech State presented the new registrations of the national inn "Kde homev můj".
The new registration of the inno was made by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available – seat with male or female voice, chorus step and instrumental edition.
The canto is under the direction of Katerína Knězynková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the revisions of the Inno are Otakar Jeremáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz website you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful inni.
He has already told the radio "Český rzhlas" that he has specifically chosen to sing the variants alone, the singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"At first I tried to have care that both the choir and the choir have the clear word, that the text is understandable, that they are in harmony," he said.
Then the national year will be held next year on the 175th anniversary.
The song "Where homemůj" was played for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh divadlo in the original opera Fidlovočka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by the music of František Škroupa.
He has bought the popularity and people have spontaneously made it his.
The first piece of the song after the founding of the Cecoslavacchia in 1918 became the natural part of the national inn.
E` remains one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How "new" sounds inno
The Prague MDD Wednesday will accompany you for the first time also with an electronic card
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, it will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers will leave in the metro, tram and bus that will have an electronic wallet in their pocket instead of the paper ticket.
At this moment if you can search for about a hundred thousand people who own their Opencard card.
Passengers can buy the one from 30 and 90 days and annually (which will come from the first of January 2009) and at the same time charge their own card in the Infopoint and in the offices of the Transport Company and at the stop of the Metro Museum, Můstek, Nadraží Holešovice, Andel, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zhrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Cut-offs can already be purchased on the Internet on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers benefited from the service before noon.
Those who start using the Internet service can completely forget the sportsmen in the subway stops where they had to make long files for paper tickets so far.
The cutting is purchased online and on Opencard it is loaded on one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places, passengers have a sports club with a personal format that will help those interested in purchasing on the Internet and will also record the credit acquired on their paper." said the spokesman for the Martin Opatrny project.
In addition to the libraries it will be possible to load the electronic clips on the Opencards in ATM and self-services that are installed at the subway entrances.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, they look like the forgetters of the tickets and the passengers have already noticed them at the stops of the metro Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five in the whole city but by the end of the year there should be eight," Opatrny concluded.
The cutting will be controlled instead than by the driver from the ATM.
The banking service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Just insert the Opencard key and before payment of the cut, you will be charged above.
Electronics are worth tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
This means in the urban lines of trains and buses from 300 to 499, that the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In the trains added to Prague's integrated transport, there are the controllers equipped with cards readers with which they verify the temporal and zone validity," explained the control mode of the Filip tickets from the Ropid organisation, which sets out the schedules for Prague's collective transport.
The urban buses have the readers of the cards integrated into the driver’s case.
During the climb it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to support the Opencard at the given point next to the box.
So the driver checks the validity of the trailers loaded.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the trailers loaded, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this type of information," Drápal added.
Passengers who take the urban buses and will not remember, when the value of the cutting goes down, can once again go to the bankomat self-service, where the cuttings are loaded on the paper.
Here you will see information about the validity of their documents on the display of the device.
The Germans of the South wanted a referendum from the United States.
In 1945 the Germans of Sudeti asked to include Šumava in the United States.
This is from the letter deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the auspices of the United States.
With this desire, according to what is said, some German groups of Sudets addressed the President of the United States in 1945.
This is in addition to the letter preserved in a private archive and today deposited in the scientific library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in the letter to the American President not to allow the return of the "Shumava district" – occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Monaco agreement – to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation and we want to be sure of the promises for which the American units arrive in the German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," it is written in the letter signed with the words "The people who have the destiny of Šumava with all the heart."
Because, they say, the annexation to Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Germans only hope for the brutality, the lack of regard, the ‘incomprehensibility,’ oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protectorate on Šumava now and forever.
"We cannot believe that regardless of the opinion of a quarter million inhabitants, I will recognize this territory as a state to us foreign, that oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has contributed for nothing, just for nothing, to the victory of the Allies," the letter writes.
The reason why the authors can't sign it is the supposed fear of the sales network by the " Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States had to doubt the conviction of the Germans in Šumava , it would be enough in the district to hold a referendum on the will of his inhabitants to become part of the United States or to live under the United States standards.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of the history of post-war war, some witnesses rightly describe the expectations of the Germans of the Sudites.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least assume that their movement from the republic would have been treated, only a few of them admitted to being quite such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the peoples of the South.
Others thought they'd just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German of Budějovice in the maritime power of the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and put in the prison camp in Holštýn , the dozens of other Czech Germans went to find him to teach him the Czech.
"These thought that once you returned home the Czech would make him comfortable," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners, who lived in Czechoslovakia during the war, reported to him that on the basis of the decrees of Beneš they would have been moved from the Republic.
Don't think you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history towards road safety.
It could also be defined as the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to leave Mercoledi.
The office of Minister Aleš Rébíček, expects this to discourage drivers from a dangerous behavior to the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet but also on volantines.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol on the wheel.
And also remind him to put the belt on before he leaves.
He wants to play in consciousness especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not finally professional drivers.
What's going to happen in the spots?
Especially stories of people who will affect emotions.
And this also testifies to the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
Don't think you'll pay!
The word "do not think" is superscripted on the tag.
And in a blood pot, there's the word "payer."
This must symbolize that a person can pay with his own life at a time of distraction.
Spots will "fear" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with dramatic scenes of the victims of accidents can be seen in common.
It is promised to lower the number of accidents and deaths on the Czech streets.
Spots have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Drivers' carats and sticks
"With the drivers, the carota system and the baton system works.
The carat for them is for example when they spend time with red and thus save time.
The baton is the danger of fine or incident.
You must remember the risk to the drivers," says the psychologist of the Ministry of Transport Martin Kořán of the Na Homolce Hospital.
And so they want information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, they believe the psychologist.
According to him, the panels that warn the danger drivers are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel has been installed warning the danger, it will probably soon be confused with the environment and the drivers will no longer pay attention to it," Kořán warns.
Olmert would return almost all the territories occupied in exchange for peace
The Prime Minister of the Israeli Interim Government, Ehud Olmert, expressed himself for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, that is also the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the heights of Golan, in exchange for the peace between the Palestinians and the Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue he published on Monday, the newspaper Jediot Acronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we will have to return almost all the areas (occupied), if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We land a certain percentage of these territories, but to the Palestinians we must leave the same percentage (of the Israeli areas), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He has admitted that any refund will also include East Jerusalem .
"Those who want security in Jerusalem and above all do not want the rusts or the spies to pass them, as one of my best friends has happened, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in the emphasis on the two July attacks in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens of injured people.
According to the prime minister it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historic places," which are within the Old City. .
"Those who want to maintain Israel's sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work," he also stressed.
The retreat from the heights of Golan
Olmert also spoke for Israel's withdrawal from the heights of Golan, that is, according to him the essential condition for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to get the heights of Golan.
They will have to give up the current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the Hezbollah (Sciit Movement); they will have to give up their permanent support, which they offer to Hamas terrorism, Al-Qaida (Terrorist Network Movement) and jihad (Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions after the incident: Are Stewards on the bus illegal?
The law doesn't recognize them, you can't walk on the long-distance bus
In the context of the tragic incident near the Italian city of Padua of the Student Agency’s pulseman, the question came out whether Stewards and passengers could move on the bus during the race.
"If we want to respect the laws strictly and formally, Steward's activity is in conflict with the law of road traffic," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The incident last week with which he lost his life a 22-year-old hostess was caused by a truck that cut the road to the pullman.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver in the less secure place of the pullman, although there were still two other seats assigned.
But the bus can cause an accident or stop suddenly even at the time of the coffee or newspaper distribution.
Depends whether the bus is equipped with or less standing positions according to the traffic book.
If the passengers are not approved, they must be seated.
Student Agency busses are not on foot, confirmed it at Aktuáln.cz the director of Radim Jančura.
"We evaluated this with the Ministry and at the beginning it did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
After it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the race if they have the assigned place," he said his point of view.
The law doesn't recognize the Steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward – no law deals with the regularization of this role."
However, no regulation prohibits the carrier from performing the services.
The road traffic law only recognizes the vehicle's accompanying term, its rights and duties are not defined," says spokesman Hanzelka.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorny believes that the law of curi is enough of this issue.
Depends whether the bus has approved seats.
Everything here," he says.
It categorizes buses in urban areas where there are pedestrians and the maximum limited speed, interurbans with pedestrians with higher maximum speed and longer handling without the pedestrians with the maximum speed allowed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in a plane, the expert says.
The expert BESIP on road safety Jaroslav Horín does not find the background problem in the Steward movement on the bus.
"During a quiet race there are not many dangers, the situation can be compared to the air service.
It's not even safe there when there's a turbulence and the flight attendant can blow his head off."
"If the bus makes a sudden stop, obviously the laws of physics apply.
Just like in the urban pullman or on the tram.
The carrier must solve the safety of the steroids with an internal regulation," he says and also understands that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Janchura is willing to suspend the services.
Student Agency is the only transport company offering the steward services..
This one uses about two hundred.
Even after the incident, the Director does not consider their profession dangerous.
"As soon as I have the feeling of having to consider the profession of the steward as dangerous work, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they leave.
They would also reduce expenditure," he says.
The director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who manages a section of lines compared to Student Agency, has motivated the absence of steroids on its means as an interest in security.
"We don't have hosts, we've been opposing each other since the beginning.
Soon or later it will end with a fatal incident," said less than a year ago Týden.cz.
It's a terrible tragedy.
In the incident of the line for Naples, a young guest in the region of Plzeň died, who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck probably came out of the emergency course without using the arrow and blocked the road to the pullman.
The pullman driver tried to avoid it with a sudden manoeuvre, but he hit it with the front right.
Jančura rejects the fact that the two seats reserved for the rest of the Stewarts were occupied.
"It is not possible to reserve these positions in the long-term pulses, they are ineligible."
The company has in mind to denounce the truck driver.
The Agency will not wait for the Court’s judgment to pay the damage to the girl’s family, but a financial compensation is expected from the offender.
The revision of the law?
Not in View
The review of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to the clarification of the Stewart movement on the bus.
"But they have not achieved any concrete results.
They do not consider them so much the pullmans, they deal more than the score system, maximum speed on the ‘autopath and use of the cell phone during the drive,’ says expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of Stewart as a major threat to passenger safety," said Portfolio Havelka, who is responsible for the police and security offices.
Düsseldorf's hopes point to Frankfurt
There are no words missing in the letter of the Director of WestLB addressed to the employees of the house.
The letter published on Monday, which could form "the centre of the capital market of the financial group of savings funds" through the meeting of the Düsseldorf banking institution's unit with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt.
West LB would launch "a competent block" with lasting profits in such a company.
In addition, such a union could be a decisive incentive for further links in the field of Länder's banks.
This is how it is read when a Board of Directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the ability of action.
Because the WestLB crash is still under severe pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also through the National Financial Surveillance Authority, having made time to point out to the regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia that the time is limited to looking for a future solution.
Of the links between the Deca-Bank, that the same customers of the Savings Fund because of their investment funds already know, and WestLB is certainly talking about it for a while, even by Frankfurt.
At the end of August, the head of the Deca-Bank Franz Waas reported on the presentation of the bill of the first half of the year that a merger of the house by via Magonza with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB makes no sense.
However, the Deka's Board of Directors, which is led by regional banks and savings banks, has delegated the Board of Directors to conduct talks with West LB on joint contracts.
This could be market negotiations or parts of them.
The talks, however, have, as they say in the business square, just started.
Dela Deka-Bank, with its 3,000 employees, is one of the most in Frankfurt's business square, not the first time it is about consolidating the savings fund sector.
In 2003, it seemed that the Deca-Bank could be founded with the regional bank of the Rhine-Palatinate and Helaba.
There was nothing from this association to three.
Once the projects were published, the Asia Regional Bank was opposed to the participation of Helaba.
The remaining two institutions have also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The regional bank of the Rhine-Palatinate went to the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg in Stockholm.
Yet they have often thought about a merger of the Deca-Bank with regional banks.
But at the end of Günther Merl, president of the Helaba Governing Council, expressed himself against design games to meet with his house.
This apart from this seems to be the idea of cognition, which is necessary to bring the different houses of the public sector closer together.
Since the Bavarian Parliament's election has passed, a Bavarian Landesbank meeting with that of Baden-Württemberg could take place first.
For Helaba, it's not all good news.
If pressure increases for other mergers, the partners will lack hand.
In the South now there would be the junior partner, although so far he has overcome the financial crisis much better than the homes in Monaco and Stockholm.
The Asia-Turingia savings fund association that participates with 85% of Helaba has put the chain to the meeting with WestLB.
Only NordLB would remain.
These geo-strategic reasons are just an account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how to combat the various business models of individual houses.
In June Merl noted that the decisive demand, which business model would ensure the future of the regional banks, would not have yet been answered by the German savings fund association.
In the end, the division of West LB could also come out, which of course is not desired by that.
Thus the letter of the Board of Directors expresses the willingness to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
It will see how the individual parties' reunification with the Deca-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it's the first time while for Luca it's the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a partner, and so she says everything is different.
Behind them at the 5l. bar of the Kaiser brand is standing a barbeque and shows about 200 travellers what the deep tones can produce from the throat.
Elena before Luca a pack and after a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking next to Porta Nuova station, this evening, they leave at 23.45 four runners with destination Monaco, Festa della Birra" , scheduled arrival at 6.30 p.m.
Three couriers are especially reserved for Italians, while only Brazilians travel in another one.
In a parking corner the South Americans are singing with the flag in hand, having already celebrated during the night.
It's so noisy, says Marco, that it's nothing for Italians.
The frame that carries a long hat with a fake fur knife and a couple of glasses with the large silver snouts belong to it.
For 5 years they've been going to Octoberfest, this year they're 3 tours.
The night break, day to day at the party, returns at 22.30.
Nighttime would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with the Kaiser beer, made according to the Bavarian rules of authenticity, the case of illness and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses go around the Brenner.
There's no beer yet.
The silence falls on the bus, the travelers sleep.
Better, they'll still need their strength.
They stop in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with an Italian train on the A9 motorway before Monaco take a short break.
When, as expected, the Marco group arrives at 6.30 p.m. at the parking close to Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others group together, Marco explains the attack program for the last time.
First: put on the yellow hat.
On it to the left is written "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the beer tendon doors open, it means running!", quotes Mark of the first morning.
"Run!" ran and occupy the positions at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, but we're blocking, and not all the yellow berets sitting on the same benches, split into the right space!"
The mouthpiece costs 8.25 Euros, Marco's urla.
And don't forget to give up.
"Protest to the security service, that we behave well!
Once you leave the places, they disappear!"
Third: "We'll meet again at 22.30 p.m. here! Understand?"
She's already going to the party.
On the road is an attack as follows the yellow berths to the trees, to the road signs and even to a advertising banner of a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the festival, known as "the final week of the Italians".
Exact data do not exist, it is 50 thousand, which go to cross the Alps and invade the tendons, it is claimed that 10% of the visitors come specifically from Italy.
The Monaco police are strengthened with 7 High Adige agents, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistics on nationality, where the Italians are the first with 200 medical care in front of the English (about 60 medical care) and the Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by Italians is the tendency of Hofbrähaus.
1. Insomnia Nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, confirmed by Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also stressed that the German banking sector was not spared by critical developments.
Because the crisis started on the weekend.
The real estate financier Hypo Real Estate, noted in DAX, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
An expert on the situation told Reuters on Monday, support credits would reach up to EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate should only pay interest for the requested party.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
Deep down are the losses of the Deffa affiliate.
According to a newspaper article, the state financier has been re-funded in the short term – which is no longer possible due to the market challenge.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserves were reduced by 95% of the EUR 2.37 million, while the capital share fell from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net income from financial affairs fell to 0 compared to last year, the benefits of increases in both demand and certain actions as well as the liquidation of collateral in loans fell by more than 70% over Euro 5 million.
Only through higher incomes from the reimbursement of subordinate compensation costs resulting from both the restructuring of the former Deffa group and the repayment of interest under the sole text of the tax laws and the management of business for business consortia, the negative profit was sufficiently moderated by around 16%.
The former public financier after being privatized in 1990 had lost in speculation with commercial real estate loans, which were carved out in Aareal Bank.
As income in classical state funding was too low, Depfa has become more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects by private and state investors (PPPs) and has been diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate now has to dampen the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group's profit and loss account.
The fact is, the dividends have been cancelled.
Already in 2007 2/3 were reduced.
The Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of the Depfa is an important financier of state and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on refinancing on the market between banks compared to other institutions, because it does not have customers' trusted deposits.
Due to the collapse of the American Bank of Investment Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, loans between banks largely dried up, because banks accumulate liquidity.
The Hippo Real Estate annually needs some of the Depfa’s credit portfolio – about 50 billion. – in the short term the means of refinancing.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financial requirement was covered by the credit for a certain period and the company protected by the influence of the international monetary markets for the most non-functional.
Other sources make it felt, which means that the money will be refinancing until the end of 2009.
The president of the HRE Steering Committee Georg Funke said otherwise that the HRE group will not need the monetary markets for a short time.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Surveillance Authority (BaFin) are based on the fact that the commerciality of the HRE group is still assured.
This is expected for the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
In view of the dynamics and impossibility of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
Funding may not be used entirely.
But the opposite is also not to be excluded.
After Sunday evening the bank as much as it learned it was about to fail, the momentary salvation failed to calm the souls.
The stock exchange rate is 75% on 3.30 Euros.
The exchange rates are quite good.
While the previous level of debt is almost irrevocable, the post-credit courses are given.
In particular, the loans of the Württemberg-Hypo affiliate are mainly affected, with a maturity of more than 2009.
Before the HRE loans seemed to be a speculative alternative investment, their value must now, after strengthening the crisis of the banks and the institution itself, which, with Depfa's emphasis on the crisis, must be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
Unless the central banks, governments and the less damaged banks are still ready, one can count on an amalgamation of annuities by the deadline.
Or it comes into operation, what no one is looking forward to – that the financial crisis is over in the next 15 months.
But you are concerned with the information covered by the partial state of affairs, the almost certain probability has become a justified hope.
It will create, in particular, long-term investors some sleepless nights with the decision if it divides itself from their commitments.
In the short term, investors may conclude the deduction of losses for future payments of the countervailing duty on value added.
Sylvana and the secrets of Bento-Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, the first day of the school should present herself at the Tachibana High School, the girls begin to laugh: German is completely "kawaii"!
What does it mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas-in the new Japan exchange log.
The first day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I also had the fifa to go to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo to Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to reach the Tachibana High School.
I had to find her on my own, and fortunately I didn't lose.
The beginning of the first lesson hour does not seem to have been fixed as with us in Lower Saxony.
The students arrive flat from 8:40 p.m. to start a brief conversation with the teacher, the so-called "home room".
But before the lesson started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I am not the type who speaks voluntarily in front of people, in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I had not yet had the school uniform, I was wearing an old dress from the host mother, along with a shirt, blue shoes and black leather shoes.
Dressed like this, I stood in front of the cathedral and tried to say well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..."- My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and celebrate my birthday in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have already started to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class were bubbling, laughing and making signs, and I continued to hear the word "Kawaii".
I've known her since my Mangas.
It belongs to the essential lessico of Japanese girls to survive and means "carino, sweet".
Then I ran fast to my place.
The girl next to me was gibberish, for her it was an honor to sit next to a exchange student.
The rest of the lesson was continued quietly, but when he played the gong, I was assaulted in the true sense of the word.
They all talked disorderly and they would laugh and dry me up with questions – then it's really hard to understand the Japanese English.
In the break, everyone opened up their Goodness.
My host mother also made me the lunch basket-- it's different from the boring German breads.
I had riceed with spices, sausages, lemon and algae salad, fruit and a kind of meat and tofu wrap..
To say the truth, I don't even know what I eat exactly in Japan.
Things seem strange and have a completely new flavor.
The fact is, everything is really good.
Maybe except the plums put under the hall, brrr!
Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It happens sometimes that a girl gives a Good done by herself, prepared quite artistically, with the hope of making the boy know during the recreation.
I read it in my manga comics.
I'm curious, if I can find out.
"Why is Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them that I would want to go to school in Japan for a year.
I always said,
"Why do you fascinate me?"
After all, I've been reading mangas and fervor for years.
And to better understand the comics and culture that contain, I started to learn a little Japanese before or after.
I was absolutely sure I'd come back once.
I'm also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
There's a lot of them here.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and latest trends -on the other hand: severe, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen in my life."
1. Even rats have feelings
A rat or a scarf escapes when they feel the danger.
The neurologist Joseph Le Doux is convinced of this: many animals also have feelings.
4. But how could it be found if, when they behave in the same way, they have our own feelings?
Articles of scientific knowledge have been published on the Internet newspaper "Edge" for some years.
6. SPIGEL ONLINE in a series presents chosen answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of conscience, without me or anyone else so far being able to prove it, since we can't even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we address other species and ask questions about feeling or in general about consciousness, we enter an impracticable territory, because the reference base does not fight.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, he does the same things that the other animals do. He pretends to be dead, he flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from where some scientists realize that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to convey our feelings to animals.
On the one hand, the side frontal cortex is often linked with human consciousness, the associated circuits (this for its direct participation in the short memory and the executive and control functions).
In man this large area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely missing.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness dependent on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the foundation on the assumption that man is even different from the other primates is thus allowed.
Another dramatic particularity should be presented in the way of talking about man: since a large part of life is connected to the language, it is often said to be connected to consciousness.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
Although consciousness does not depend on language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of the animal, as it is made, certainly differs much from the circumstances of our conscience.
That is why it is difficult to find out how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through its experience due to the special hardware, their search will cause great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but in addition there is another aspect of consciousness to which it would be easier for science to have access.
The processes of animal consciousness could be analysed regardless of their content, and that is exactly what happens in the studies on the short memory of the primates, in particular in the example of visualization.
So for this principle, which Christof Koch und Francis Crick follows, it goes first to the neural correlations of the consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: they could both be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of the display.
What, then, is designed for feelings?
I blame them for the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of their conscious activities of the brain.
What we call "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the body's reactions) occupys the memory of work.
In view of this, the feelings are closely linked to the regions of the cortex, which characterize the primacy and, in particular, the human being.
The talking nature creates subtle shades of feeling, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
In view of this, Antonio Damasio believes, for example, that feelings are more primitive activities of the regions of the body of the feelings of the cortex and of the head pale, similar to Jack Panksseep, which has however concentrated more on the paleocephalus.
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed much, this could be absolutely part of the species-extended feelings.
At purely theoretical level, I cannot contradict it, but I believe it to be indisputable.
Pankseep brings arguments about the fact that what for rats and human beings appears to be afraid is likely to be so with the senses in both cases: but how could it happen if rats and human beings prove the same when they behave in a similar way?
A scratch in case of danger escapes as if he too felt the fear?
In my view, the mere similarity of behavior cannot yet show any vital similarity.
And that is, the neural confrontation continues to be helpful: rats and human beings have similar paleoencephalus, not even a brain.
But is paleoencephalus responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove it for human beings, how would you like to demonstrate it on rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, there is progress at the renal level, provided that the same procedure on rats and men is abandoned.
As I don't research language and consciousness in rats, so I don't do it on their emotions, I don't even know if they exist.
This can be considered a myopic, but I prefer to take a step forward, rather than constantly kicking against a wall.
I'm a practical emotional about this.
UEFA President Platinum: shipment to Poland and Ukraine
The Vice-President Ivan Wasjunik said that preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize the Europeans with Poland," Vasjunik said.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries"
Both the master countries of the house are in the march table for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports.
The number of stages to be set for Europeans will eventually be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We now have to work at maximum speed," said the president of the Ukrainian association Grigorij Surkis.
"the UEFA will keep an eye on us"
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After many scandals, the leadership of the Polish PZPN association was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "the serious danger that PZPN is unable to operate in accordance with the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish PAP information agency.
"In a letter we assured the President of UEFA Michel Platini that the preparation for the EM 2012 will not suffer."
Several members of the first division were sentenced only in the last season for manipulation, and at the end of the last time the beginning of the Law had to be postponed.
Dennis Quaid Ribette Angry
He wanted to promote a new film, he talked about the private and now he's grown up with the ex: Hollywood Meg Ryan's star has declared his ex Dennis Quaid an adult.
He's squeezing the rib.
War of the Roses is delayed by the former couple Meg Ryan und Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation, the two Hollywood actors are now arguing with each other a bad fight - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week expressed himself for the first time on the reasons of marriage failure: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and this has been very painful."
The scope of the betrayals she would have come to know only after separation.
The opportunity for the "soul of the soul" was the work with Ryan's print for his new film "The Women" – the story of an adult.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his being publicly declared an adult husband was a clear shock: it would be "inaudible", said the fifty-fourth anniversary to "New York Daily News", which "Meg repeats and reworks the story of our relationship for the same time".
It would also be "deplorable" that in Jack , the sedentary son they had together again "are publicly remembered the pain and overcoming, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan from separation lives alone, Quaid is remarried and will soon become a father of twins.
And so his judgments close with the arrow: "My life goes on in any case.
I'm happy to have a wonderful family to which everything goes for the best."
They charge prices for air tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008 flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be up to 50% cheaper
Flights and nights in the hotel have become more convenient - this is the result of a study by the financial provider and American Express travel.
The company analysed its booking data in the first half of 2008 and, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, observed a significant decrease in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, overnight stays in many places are already priced.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities still under review on average around 6.9 compared to 2007
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6% lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year earlier.
American Express sees as the reason for this the weak dollar quote, which would lead to a "hot desire to travel American tourists"
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected by the drop in hotel prices in a stronger way than industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with an increase of 26.3% hold even the record in Europe
With regard to the prices of flights, the trend in the first quarter still points to:
As a result of the Cherosene refuelling of the Economy Class passengers had to pay on average 7.1% compared to 2007, long-range fuel flights would even be up to 29.2% more expensive
From April to June, the prices of the Economy Class air tickets fell on average 12,5 % compared to the previous quarter, however, in the first class and business the price changes were much weaker.
In Germany prices are even stronger than in other European countries:
From January to March prices were 11.9 %, in the second quarter they fell 23.6 %.
As for domestic German flights according to the study, prices were even reduced.
On the one hand, the company explains the reason for the price fluctuation.
The demand in many parts of the air travel market has collapsed.
On the other hand, there would be through the open sky agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe, an increased pressure on competition.
The sign of the critical situation would be the deletion of non-profitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 would have declared failure – only in Europe it was 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach for 1 to 0
With a goal and simple methods, Hamburg's SV becomes chief.
In Borussia Luhukay is still unable to find a group of 11 that works.
Here Christopher Klein increases the landing of luck for the national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player first got into the game late and failed with a shot on the cross
His message was accurately formulated, passed on his lips convincingly.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal," exclaimed Hermann Rieger in the cabs of the Hamburg Arena.
It did not happen that in the catacombs, the game break was over and most were sitting back in their place.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist of HSV for nearly 3 decades, enjoying an even larger estimate of some old players.
And so his monk found even heard in the high spheres.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol canceled and raised the thumb in sign of approval.
Cornelius is the master coach's brother in Hamburg Martin Jol.
His order must have played in a similar way: here's the second goal!
No change in location.
"Today it wasn't all good to see," Marcel Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have become "more relaxed".
For the 1 to zero ones in Hamburg, they must thank the blow of the head of Mladen Petric (11) and the fact that many weak players in Gladbach could not have hurt the weak players in Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
The SV of Hamburg will be 121 years old this Monday.
The viewers already celebrated before, in the afternoon of Saturday, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the shining class on the video screen, which has legitimized their sports society as before the class.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"We are able to put everything in place," said Marcel Jansen.
It has the presentation that the provisional table certificate is more indicative of the unpredictability of the sample than of its HSV dominance.
The team with its new late arrivals – the Brazilian Neves und Silva, the defender of the Petric gate as well as Jansen suffocating to the FC Bayern – finds itself slowly, but has not yet been able to shine.
"We need more atmosphere and more dribbling," relaunchs with force Jol.
After the vote was taken
Wall Street's all about fear.
The first news of the failure of the rescue package has temporarily crushed the Dow Jones of 700 points.
This was the greatest loss of points in the space of a day of his history.
Later down came back a little later.
Around 20:30 the world's most important stock exchange barometer has quoted/recorded with a good 5% in cash on 10,579 payers.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange was firm with a deficit of more than 7% on 1548 points
The biggest loss at the time was the Dow American Express, it gave us just 14%, and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12%.
No title could have done it.
The shares of the Goldman Sachs bank amounted to just 10 %.
Only a few days before the big investor Warren Buffett had taken part in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the financial funds needed to be allocated to cover the so-called mortgage documents.
The amount must be paid, however, not in a hit, but in degrees.
If the State were to withdraw it, it had to keep the stock option sheets of the financial companies, which could be redeemed with a proper rate of deductions, to reduce the liability for the State's cash.
The course of action in Europe and in the USA in the vortex of the lower
The billions of aid to banks in Europe and in the USA do not remove investors' doubts.
The course of the actions of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate falls to peak and lasers the index of the German bag down
The American Dow Jones index gives us back despite the planned financial market security through the State.
Spectacular loss of the course of the Hypo Real Estate and the Commerzbank have drawn the index of the German stock exchange into a deep deficit.
The actions of the Real Estate Funder in Monaco have lost 3 quarters of their value, despite the rescue of the federal government and private banks temporarily, the Commercial Bank has given up more than 20%.
The index of the German stock exchange DAX is clearly broken under the psychologically important 6000 points and is quoted with a deficit of 3.7% of 5,839 points.
The world's stock markets are falling apart.
New York Wall Street has opened with a clear deficit.
Investors have feared that the 700 billion-dollar rescue package of the US government could not be sufficient to bring the financial markets back to growth.
The Dow lost 334 points in the first business hour or 3.3% of 10,809,25 points.
The House of American Members wanted to vote on the rescue plan, and the vote in the Senate could follow the first of October.
The other European Stock Exchanges also managed only one direction: in London the FTSE index has now fallen by 3.2%, the CAC 40 in Paris has lost 2.9%.
In Asia, the Nikkei reference index after the initial profits had a margin of 1.26 % of 11,743,61 payers.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index is dropped from 2.1% to 18.286,90 points.
In India the Sensex background index lost 506,43 points or 3,9 % and closed with 12,595.75 payers.

Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years a mysterious phenomenon has created perplexity among scientists: the dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity might not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses space probe flew through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the fuel pipes that freeze fast, it is now up to you to freeze death.
Among scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon creates confusion – the anomaly of Swing-by
The Swing-by is a flight manoeuvre of space probes, with which they obtain additional salt/spin/osculation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example on Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical expedition as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What surprises scholars for years: the reasons do not behave exactly as we would expect under the gravity law.
Instead, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far, the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year the Swing-by anomaly was reintroduced.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of Albert Einstein's relativity, which describes the attraction force of matter with a curve of space, might not be entirely accurate.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study believes firmly as before Einstein made a mistake, and tries to explain Swing-by's anomaly through the so-called dark matter that astronomers have seen in the cosmos.
"Responsible of the anomaly could be the dark matter that could also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
Of the existence of the dark matter, space scholars have known only for about 10 years.
There is obviously a force of attraction from her, whose effect on other heavenly bodies is seen.
It itself is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation of any kind, especially any visible light.
According to scientists, the dark matter is at least one fifth of the total mass of the cosmos.
The tourists captured in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists captured in Egypt would be free again, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had asked for several million euros of ransom.
In a shooting before the release 6 kidnappers were killed.
In southern Egypt, 5 Germans were kidnapped.
The ransom negotiations are already under way.
The Germans are always at the scene of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was consistent with the Egyptian TV, the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabia and the Italian media.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian TV broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our citizens and other hostages have been released
We are examining their health," Frattini said.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions would be in good health and safe, reported the Egyptian TV.
The 19 components of a expedition in the desert are already on the way to Cairo.
There is still little clear indication of the delay in a shooting that took place before the release of the hostages: hence, the kidnappers would have been ready to conclude the kidnapping after the instructions of an Egyptian public security officer, before the Sudanese army killed 6 of them.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed on a ransom," the officer said.
It would be "only meant for the delivery of the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" arrived.
Sudanese soldiers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had been killed by fire at 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers claimed a savings of EUR 6 million from Germany; the money should have been delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" referred to a German intermediary, the release of hostages would be delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release the women in hostage after the ransom was paid.
The men would have to remain held until the kidnappers had had a safe escape route.
The German embassy to Cairo rejected a position on the report .
Father's abuses "carried to suicide"
Years of abuse by the father brought a woman to kill himself, he declared a court.
Michael Treise, 57 years old, of Stithians, Cornovaglia, was in prison for 6 years after admitting eight cases of sexual assault.
The Court of True Crown Court learned that he regularly harassed his daughter, Stephanie Randle, when she was between the ages of five and seven.
Trerise wrote in a note of the confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court found that Ms. Randle was killed in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child and lived in Coventry, Treise harassed her and blessed her before having sexual relations, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Treise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he came back to live in Cornwall.
His daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court found that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteering for the National Trust, was tortured by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, the Public Minister Ramsey Quaife said to the court that Mrs. Randle's friends, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, were "emotionally dead", and who had "spoiled with life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
You think you killed yourself by suffocating yourself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's father, who wrote a letter of confession that ended: "The League and the Blessed One".
"I didn't bother you sexually.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Treise: "He is an extremely strange fetishist, and for his victim he must have been terrifying, especially when he was only seven years old.
"This terrible saga ends with the victim who takes away his life.
Even harder is the fact that if he had not done so, it would have been difficult for the facts to be finished before the court."
I know the effects that Stephanie's father and mother have had on their daughter these years.
" Otherwise it was clearly likely that she was a promising and happy young success."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Office's official who left the top-secret documents on a train in June must be accused by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC has learned.
The man was transferred from the Ministry of Defence when he left on the train for Waterloo two highly classified documents.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
It is the least delicate of the accusations made under this law and there is nothing to suggest a criminal attempt.
The BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said the movement would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
"They would have thought that this was treated internally at the Mod and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is to be accused under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause relating to the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service has recommended that the officer be accused by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The missing documents contained assessments on al-Qaaeda and the security capabilities of Iraq.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was taken away from his home and brought to a hidden place.
Construction companies face the B&B account
English construction companies could face an account of more than £80 billion after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley.
The government has given 14 billion sterlings to protect the 2.6 million savings deposits of Bradford & Bingley.
The interest on that loan will be paid by all companies that take the savings, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Building Societies Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it is "enraging" that companies and their members have to pay.
The 14 billion sterling loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans are redeemed.
But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be paid each year to 700 financial companies that take deposits, but the interest that will mature in the meantime will be owed each year to 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is annoying that those institutions that have acted cautiously... are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to 450 million sterlings in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find 81 million sterlings to pay for the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the construction company association, told the BBC that he believes it is unfair.
"It is annoying that those institutions that have acted cautiously in the market in the resumption of houses are now called upon to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less cautious."
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the documentation began in 1945.
"We need to examine all aspects in the coming weeks to see which options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what might be a significant account," Mr Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of a whole year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organisations without shareholders, their members end up paying the account through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
The milk comes with 5 pennies per litre
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that there will be an increase in the wholesale prices of her milk for an extra five-penny per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-penny increase in February, and comes after a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retail sellers must decide whether they want to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the increase in February, the wholesale price changed for the last time in 2002.
Declined the deposit to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A Bangladesh court rejected a request for bail from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that she could be arrested when she comes back to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant 50 million takas ($729,700) to a businessman when he was a member of parliament.
The case is one of many corruption charges against her.
The political rival of Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia, had long been released on bail at the beginning of the month.
The return to Bangladesh by Sheikh Hasina is scheduled for the next few weeks, but his party, Awami League, asked that the country's temporary government supported by the military first day of total freedom.
The correspondents say that while she was going abroad for medical treatment on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of her release, if she can remain in freedom when she comes back to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the Order of the High Court.
"The High Court rejected the request for bail for Sheikh Hasina by saying that she cannot have the bail because she is already abroad on the word for medical care," said his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We shall present or appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs security to return to the country from the outside to prepare the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina's home is expected after October 17th, a senior leader of the Avami League party said on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the government attached to the military took power, but was released in June, to go abroad to receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear for Afghan campaign anti-polo
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing the recent immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the UN says.
The United Nations has launched a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
But it's said that he can't reach children in Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A United Nations spokesman said that despite the promises of the Taliban that would not have attacked or hindered thousands of people from the staff carrying the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission's decision to force the company to reduce its participation in the rival ITV television station.
BSkyB was told by the competition court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission had said that BSkyB's participation impeded competition and allowed an unusual influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the participation in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB's participation in ITV raises doubts about the independence of ITV, making the Competition Commission launch an investigation.
The chief of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, the consumer groups and the regulator of Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stack was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into the US prosecutor's case
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special Public Ministry to examine the release of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation took place when a report on the case was made by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticizing the actions of the Administrative Officers.
The report was critical to the White House, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was triggered by the fear that prosecutors were removed for political reasons.
The Public Special Minister Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials questioned during the investigation have lied to the investigators in an attempt to hinder justice.
"Serious allegations of potentially criminal behaviour have not been fully investigated or clarified," Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The assignment of a special public ministry with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine US prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department said that the lawyers had been fired for late performance.
But later it turned out that the licensored lawyers had not been assessed more late than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the licensor was motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in the judicial action against the Republican members of the High-Profile Congress, while others had refused to investigate the charge of fraud against democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and bring cases before the court on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was in the firestorm for redundancies, and finally he regained his position.
A number of other officials from the Justice Department were fired.
(The Inspector General's report was very critical in relation to Mr Gonzales' role in the case, saying that he had a primary responsibility in the dismissals, which he had dedicated to his role as leader and had been extremely distracted during the process.
Other officials, including Bush Karl Rove's former senior assistant, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigations.
The epica dei Meat Loaf will be celebrated
The rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored at the Q Awards for its inno Bat Out Of Hell epic.
The singer, who will return his special gold prize to the ceremony next week in London, said he was "honored" to gain recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the hit track of Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
Coldplays will lead the nominations for the awards this year, being in the list of nominations in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of the Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that pass things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely one of those."
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocality that was provided by the Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrument section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was performed as a single in UK in 1979 and reached its fifteenth place.
But Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell's album remained in class for almost nine years and came to sell more than 40 million copies in the world.
Meat Loaf - true name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including an intervention for an irregular heart beat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute larynx forced him to cancel the concerts.
It came out later that he had a cyst on a vocal string.
Dark streets of the city, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, roads and other crossings, some famous, others just using.
But also many veteran taxi drivers and residents have long found it difficult to give the position of Extra Place, because they have never heard of it.
The narrow road is in the East Village and goes north from First Street – without making the Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty wolf than an active road traffic.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlante.
The road must, however, have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of luxury buildings recently built on the First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner transition for shops and boutiques that should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include close to long time who say they were hit by the thorny road simply because it was one of the last remains of the noble neighborhood of the past.
But the city's conservation and development department, which has road control, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the Committee on Land Use of the County Municipal Committee some representatives from the city agency and Avalon Bay drew up a proposal for the real estate company to buy the roads.
But the committee prefers the road to stay in the city's hands, and asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, director of the Community Board 3 District.
"There is very little space left to the property of the city, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place," he said.
"There could be the proposals to regulate and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee public access."
Avalon Bay announced many months ago that he wanted to reopen the small street and install seating places, including some to use for a coffee where the real estate company hopes to rent the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay bought the road was made public for the first time this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renew this abandoned village and turn it into a public amenity," he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for Preservation Accommodations, said that it was in fact the city's desire to sell the road and noted that the agency's purpose was to develop property rather than administer it.
Compared to its most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a light historical print.
Some believe that he took the name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was split between his many children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the road is perhaps better known as the photo cover set of the Ramones' "Rocket to Russia."
"The ground was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
"He was full of immunities, brandies of clothes and pieces of boots, posters, sheets, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write "genrification" of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, suggesting that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others praised Extra Place as a rarity – a fragment of the city almost changed for nothing that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A little nostalgic look at the city in the way of extinction"), published part of a talk of the history of the city that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is an odd visa without exit, dark also of day and limited doors of storage in rustic iron and windows with saracines, with old newspapers of weeks that flow along the bottoms."
With few exceptions, the road seemed almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat ran agile through the back of the road near a door leading into the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
There were graffiti on the walls and an empty 22 ounce bottle of beer near a group of abandoned newspaper fresh.
A few passersbys said they rarely thought about Extra Place, but they suggest they'd need to be a little adorable.
Mr. Fields, for his part, said that he also thinks that some people underestimate the attraction of the road in his current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in black, dirty and disgusting places."
Bilingual debate: divestment in English
At this point of Educational Look, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a senior member of California's studies and senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Because the middle class needs to choose a school."
Indeed attracting Spanish voters is a complicated matter.
Barack Obama's educational projects are a significant example.
Mr Obama's campaign notes that "African and Latin students have significantly less probability of diplomats than white students, "that is true.
In order to combat these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama's educational plan specifically supports, among other things, "transit bilingual education" for English students.
However, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in languages other than English, does not take into account his interest in filling learning differences.
Let us take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in the eastern county of Los Angeles.
School students are for the Spanish and low-income majority.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But among the fourth students, a surprising 100 percent of the students did the higher level test in the 2008 mathematical status exam.
An equally surprising 93% of fourth-class students have done the expert level test on English-language art.
This incredible result was achieved using a different ingredient from that preferred by Mr Obama.
Sixth Street emphasizes the review and exercise, constant assessment of the skills and an attitude of the type "no excuse".
Furthermore, and it is here that Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of the Sixth Street, of the school's obstructive approach to English students is "full dive."
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We had a fantastic success with a student just coming from Mexico and if you had entered the class 12 months after you would not be able to identify what it was".
"It works," he remarked, "for us it works."
Would Obama take a school as a model like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other Spanish majority schools and with English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that question very easy, but education policy in its own party (National Education Associations) and its continued support for bilingual education prevent Mr Obama from predicting the answer.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the point when he said that people should stop worrying about "English-only" legislation.
Instead, he said, "You must be sure that your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these achievements gaps, he should consider carefully the educational models that work rather than despise them or banish them.
The oil suddenly calms and renews the economic fear
Oil prices have fallen sharply on Monday because of concerns that even the US rescue plan for financial markets may not be able to boost the economy.
The future of the wheat fell from 7 percent to $99.80 at the New York Stock Exchange in the morning operations.
Prices have lost more than $20 at the bar from last Monday.
In the last two weeks, raw materials markets have been cut off from Wall Street's financial agitation, and by a couple of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of $145.26 in June, prices were reduced to almost $90 in early this month, before rising again, on the background of a tremendous uncertainty in the financial markets.
The anxiety affected investors again Monday even after the congress leaders said they had reached an agreement at the weekend about the rescue plan, the biggest in history.
The news was obscured by the fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from past.
In the last episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will purchase the bank operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the Fortis European financial conglomerate.
The analysts at Barclays Capital said that the late weekend's frenzied negotiations had led to a rescue agreement " seemed to have failed to revitalize the market's feeling.
As the economic situation worsened, we expect the demand for raw materials, including oil, to calm down.
"The perspective for global equity, interest rates and exchange rates markets has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank's analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape the contamination.
From the perspective of raw materials, our most pressing concern is to what extent the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China."
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for the next year, while household oil consumption due to slowdown in economic growth, reducing the forecast price of oil and gas by about 20 per cent for 2009.
The operation in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time than anyone with the Jets uniform in the last eight and more seasons, the defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he watched it take place on the second quarter of Sunday, when the Jets turned a game without points into a climb.
"Never seen anything like it," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had equalled the grizzling of the threatening clouds that were overcoming them with a fiasco game.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for a afternoon in which their growing symphony made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles for two other touchdowns in the room, including one when one cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first time.
"I didn't leave my path," said Favre of all the passage to Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people can think."
While Favre and Coles played games, the defense severely hit Cardinals Kurt Warner's quarterback.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a waving launch and relaunched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith planned another passage and intercepted it.
The linebacker David Bowens forces a Warner fan.
The last turnover, the fumble forced by Bowens, could have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals took advantage of that ball possession, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had taken over the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely had a target of 20 yards, for an advantage of 34 to 0.
It was more than the Jets have ever signed in a room.
When asked to describe the madness, the coach of the Jets Eric Mangini said, "The second fourth or the third fourth?"
When he was both told - the Jets gave 21 points without answer in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I liked the second quarter much more than the third."
There's been a lot of points in a little bit of time."
Gebrselasia resting above its record of the world
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has shown again because many consider him the best marathon ever, breaking his same record of the world to the Berlin marathon Sunday and becoming the first person to race 26.2 miles under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory on the race on a favorable plane at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie sent for 27 seconds his previous score of 2:03:26, run last year in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselassie sets up the 26th record of the world's careers such that it has produced a world championship or a record of the world at every distance from one mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped Pechino's Olympic marathon, fearing - perhaps in too alarming, in retrospect - that air pollution would worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees from departure, 55 degrees from arrival - Gebrselassie won on Sunday with an average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half of the founders like Gebrselasia and Paul Tergat of Kenya went a long distance, the marathon record fell more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo from Costa del Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had his eyebrows at the pulpits and missed a week of training.
Of course, the rest left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselasia said to the reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had some doubts today, but eventually everything went well."
It was a bit critical - especially in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia - for having orchestrated its races excessively, usually avoiding many of the best marathon stars in the world, counting on the apripist as if it were a mid-fund race, and putting world records over the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely decrease the size of Gebrselasia's skills as a marathon.
With the four Kenyan steps on Sunday, Gebrselasia reached the midpoint of the road at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, held Gebrselassie in competition after the apricots fainted.
A little over three miles from arrival, Gebrselassie made a final effort to separate from Kwambai, which ended second at 2:05:36, improving her best personal time for almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, native to Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise winner of the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She lost the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad incident, but she was cured to win Berlin, making her best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
She ran a race doing the calculations well, leaving a quarter of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to go with a big distance, taking it back after about 18 miles and a half.
Askale Tafa Magarsa dell'Ethiopia arrived second at 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop del Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the theme park on the Orlando suburbs, a few miles from the splendor, from the noise, from the enormous, lies the quiet city where pride and the complications of African-American experience enter life.
Eatonville, the first black city incorporated into the country and Zora Neale Hurston's home, is no longer as simple as described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, abundance of guava, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a pilgrimage place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect for Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
Yet in many ways, the city that has described - and that stops tourists from understanding it in the Florida tourist guide produced by the Depression era Federal Writers' Project - remains a separate place.
It is so independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, who "knowing so little of us, don't know what's going on."
Even now, in a year where a black presidential nomination, Senator Barack Obama, was called for an opening talk on the race, many here remain disconcerting the look of the outsider.
"We are very careful about how our history is told," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, a resident of all life and a member of the oldest church in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradise of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of taking power from black and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary centre but also an example of the shadows of the rural culture of the South Blacks - sometimes dishonored, sometimes awarded - born by American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both fair and protective.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really began with Zora, who all here are called Hurston.
She presented the world to her hometown through sincere books, rich in dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes We Are Watching God" (1937).
Five sections of Florida's guide transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten centre of Florida within a scenario of black history and human drama
Low as a grancass both in life and in literature, Hurston brought the readers into the store owned by the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then turned into more private areas.
"Out of the street to the left," he wrote, "it's the modern public school, brown with the finishings in white, with its well-maintained gardens and courtyards, to which Howard Miller always looked, thinking he could just read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever fits to the passage rooms".
Thus in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
That wasn't really Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora said it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's girls that Hurston immorts her by quoting men who sing big songs about their beauty.
Add: "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who often returned from his family transferred to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, remembers that when Hurston was flying in the city, he usually arrived without notice in a triumph Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that today also enjoys dignified clothing.
Many inhabitants were fascinated, said Mr. Franklin, while others were in suspense.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But, in addition, dondolandes on his chair on the courtyard on the back overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was very likely baptized, "he never stayed long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books had gone out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although he once was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard College in the 1920s, he was buried in a dead tomb in Fort Pierce, Fla., where he lived.
In Eatonville, there was no great commemorative ceremony, and no great conference.
"I don't think they understand their contribution to the world or their abandonment to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography by Hurston published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-course highway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-course road.
Orlando's expansion has already pushed the Interstate 4 across the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period of his history.
Enforced integration, in addition to other things, had put an end to its idyllic isolation of the community
In the 1950s, the battle on racial mix brought hatred on the community's home door.
"During that period, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and things to the people who were sitting on one side," said Mr. Franklin.
"We actually had a girl who was killed that time.
They've got a coconut from a car."
In a letter from 1955 to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made the Supreme Court a request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown against the school office "a insult rather than an honor for my race".
The residents now say that the disengagement of schools, despite being positive in some respects, unravels the cohesion of Eatonville and reiterates the confidence of its young people.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember this - hug your teacher in the morning, hug your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter, and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace your white teacher because your white teacher... - I mean, there's a cultural division there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcame the prejudices, as he did, with joy security of himself and lines like: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I can't quite understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long walk to the dead end of Hurston and began to fight for the resurrection of his reputation.
Five years later, a lively biography on Hurston of Robert E. Hemenway hit the library sheds, reintroducing it into the American cannon.
The project of the highway arrived just as his most famous daughter had crossed the lights of the coast again.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston saw her as a savior.
The community began to design in 1988 a festival dedicated to Hurston to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January, many come back for the memorial.
Many years later, the state withdrew from its road project.
"The five lines of the resurrected highway have brought what would be called high speed, a real pride for the city," said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd puts her in a simpler way: "Now she saved Eatonville."
The victory on the road project helped change the image the city has of itself.
Those outside the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to come to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to reassess the past.
Eatonville joined the public historical register in 1998.
A new library on a single floor (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a Kennedy Boulevard repatriated and abbreviated.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly of Florida: only six miles from the center of Orlando, can give the feeling of a secondary road under the summer rain, small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s of the 1800s.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
The outsiders who come to look for the story of Eatonville, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A requested permission in advance is required for most of the interview, to some things - such as the walls on the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man, who shows black men in the fields - do not have permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a fat teacher, with a weakness for the bright red, still fear that their island community will be broken.
However, as soon as the Hurston Festival has expanded, a high level of citizen pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, no better, nor worse and fair, creative, great worker, shock and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is a genuine civil affection that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the Police Department, who said he might need help.
And also those younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, twins 11 years from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Many people, if they have just entered here, will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,' said Alondra Kenon after putting in a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it's really a nice city."
Here in New York, we all talk fluidly about finance
On the surface, nothing's changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from newspapers and huge television screens of Times Square, they would not be able to stand in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that the glass offices, nesting over their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York live the worst "gross day in the office" every day from the 1929 round.
The factors shake metal carts for the way through the marches, carrying muffin vases for breakfast meetings.
Latin-Americans draw their feet between condoms carrying, like human mules, 50 and twisted shirts appear to a stick on their backs.
The employees are still waiting in line for their morning bagel to the food carts on the treadmills, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 of a working day.
It did not seem that there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new book of savings Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the façade so that it would coincide with the afternoon break to my subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, a line of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's gym, to collect money or deposit, but in front of the customer service gym, where old customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions for the big Macy warehouse and new customers start accounts.
Many of those before me, I would have learned from Starr, my "trust banker," were in line for the same reason.
On the contrary, however, they have already taken the savings from smaller banks from the places where the pendants, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They have taken the money from the so-called trifft (a little like a construction company), credit cooperatives and types of city savings banks whose subsidiaries operate only within a state, and say they treat customers as family.
In the past years, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In the last days the Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, was submitted to the controlled administration, and, while the New Yorkers went home for the weekend afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a buyer who saved it.
The employees and tradesmen who were in front of me, imprudent for another strike, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe port, the bank that is asking for more bail on Wall Street.
Common New Yorkers in the last few weeks have become competent in finance.
A woman to my Chinese trusted supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank went bankrupt, and her embezzled Director General Dick Full in the whole family, as if lying to a bad colleague.
And Lyn, the uniform portinia, almost fifty-year-old of my condominium, has changed the subject compared to our normal topic of conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my expenses.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I've changed, I'm not running any risk."
The Muslim tomb was profaned while Austria turned to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left of the right wing of the Party of Liberty and Filip Dewinter of the right-wing Belgian party Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization "City Against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They bring signals like those street mosque representatives with a red line that passes in the middle.
The police blamed the right extremists for profaning a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that the political parties on the right won a lot at the national general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at Traun cemetery, near Linz, in some hours between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believe was an organized action.
The culprits have traced with the spray Hebrew symbols such as the Star of David above some graves, but the detectives believe it could have been an attempt to mask the extremist motivations guided by a hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear if the incident is somehow linked to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the profanation, which occurred at the end of Ramadan, months of religious relevance to Muslims.
In the meantime, Austria has embarked on a journey of spiritual research following its right course in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right parties that took almost 30 percent of the votes, the party of Austrian freedom and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, made a campaign with extremely anti-immigration tickets and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobia critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Party of Freedom who won more than 18 percent of the votes, made a campaign against candles and burkas and also expressed his opposition to the food that is perceived as connected to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, leading to political symbols of the continuing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Investigations and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have set the extreme right as the nation's strongest political bloc, indicating that the change was brought to the fore by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel abroad forbidden to Gary Glitter.
In Gary Glitter, the glamour star of the guilty rock of sexual abuse on children, was forbidden to travel in France and Spain from the court.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after informing the authorities that controlled him to go to Spain through France.
The ban on travel abroad was granted to the Kent police on Thursday after giving the magistrates the evidence of previous arrests of Glitter for sexual abuse on minors.
Glitter, true name Paul Gadi, was not present at Ashford's prize in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesperson for the Court Service said: "On Thursday, 25 September at Ashford's rate, Kent's police filed a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling abroad in France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present."
Glitter, 64 years old, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as requested by the register of sexual offenders.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also required to give a seven-day notice to the police on his scheduled departure date.
The lack of notification to the authority may lead to a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent's police said they don't want to discuss individual cases or possible Glitter movements in the country.
A Kent police spokesman said: "Kent police will do all they can to protect children in this country or abroad.
"In our view, it is easier to control someone who remains in the UK because we have the right complete systems to manage every potential risk more effectively.
"Protecting Kent's residents is the main concern of Kent's police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of sexual offenders in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two boys aged 10 and 11.
When Glitter came, he flew to Bangkok where he was supposed to board a flight to London.
But he said he was sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not have made it pass through the passport and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also did not allow him to enter and return to Bangkok where the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
At the end, he arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge, west of London, since Scotland Yard successfully asked for an order to include him in the register of sexual offenders.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the United Kingdom in 1999 for having images of abuses on children.
One source of the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacques Smith, the Secretary of the Interior, felt assured and happy that Glitter was stopped by traveling in France and Spain.
"I photograph the teacher away from the scene to draw the character" Günther Bauer, photographer
No spots, no wheels, no clothes from the start.
Only the essence of the great master of the flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the release of the man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in private, at those moments away from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressivity of the hands, are natural because they must not go into the scene.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some of the songs, dancers and guitarists on stage with the less well-known side of these masters.
With this objective, the photographer offers an original flamenco iconography, taking it from various visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the programming of the Flamenco Photo Month, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day ever larger," explains the artist and explains that in "Flamenco-People" it could also be common people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical pictures of artists, interpreters or performers on the scene.
These "on the street" portraits are "artists able to transmit passion, sorrow, joy when they are on stage ... and capture the public.
In order to take on the personality of these great ones, it is not necessary to draw them back into the scene,
because their personality and character are inner.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the great flamenco with the camera."
With the passion for the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer started a long journey back in 1997 to attract singers, guitarists or dancers using a slide camera.
They are portraits that, because of the type of machine and the material, remember the classic photography.
The application of various stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects the conception of Bauer's own flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not dancing, singing or playing in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, capable of winning the audience with his art.
The search for a meeting with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, were and have been the constant of this work, at the El Fotomata gallery in these days.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Friend, among others, are listed in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a kind of flamenco anthology, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits shown on the occasion of the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "SportARTProject" portraits.
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I want to draw people, know them and be able to penetrate for a moment in their lives, whether this is a long or short moment.
I think the portrait is the most difficult kind in photography.
You meet or confront people, characters you don't even know at times or give you just a few minutes to take the picture.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
The collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people", is set up at the El Fotómata gallery, on the number 20 via de la Mata, parallel to Via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until next October 16.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he's writing is a "gambling"
It is surrounded by places he still does not know and it deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is at the scene with a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who has lived for twenty years in Congo and has crossed the Amazon.
Ever favorite for the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project he is currently dealing with "is an accident" and that "all indicates that I shouldn't write it."
"If I had a good sense, I wouldn't write it, but I'll just do it and hope to finish it as soon as I can," he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days he saw pass through the city of Acquedot a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The city and los perros" was, as prognosis, the figure of spike at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award to be the most voted writer by the participants – an ancient edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend" book, filled the venues of Juan Bravo.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of a public who had fled the time when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, revocated as born in him the literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of "the pleasure of reading" and "of living beyond what I was living"; as he writes in "disciplined mode" to supplement the "lack of inspiration", with an intense documentation, writing and continuous recovery work; as Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas have influenced his vocation and as "the images of memory" are the basis on which his stories are based.
The Spanish-American novelist, acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if the books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an experiential experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, arguing that, on the contrary, "there are effects" and that "makes the most anti-conformist people." That's why he invited writers to "do not give up on the frivolity" and to " assume responsibility" of their vocation.
Time hinders the Festival of Pozoblanco, preventing it from running
The celebration of the races that should have suggested the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the tournaments selected for the races had verified that the conditions on the floor of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
Weathers broke against this festival, preventing two days from celebrating on three days.
On Saturday, the rain stopped the second race of bullies.
The cartels included Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who would have faced a bull from Castilblanco.
Therefore, the festival had regular performance only on Friday.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque to triumph, cutting three ears and coming out into triumph, after having tore with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante finished his two races by taking out health and an ear, granted more by the public than about the race itself.
The worst among them was El Juli, passing through the arena of Los Llanos without glory and without pain.
With the second bull, after a tremendous mule, the fish of most of the public were earned.
A truck with two thousand kilos of hashish crosses the block point in Alava
Five less than ten in the morning.
Agents hold the height of the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping, they give themselves to the escape.
Agents have urged the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping, they ran away.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
After they have been pursued, the agents are able to arrest one of the two employees, a man of about 28 years old, identified as A. A. J., as reported in the communication of the Department of Internal Affairs of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual is accused of drug trafficking and the falsification of public documents.
The incident occurred when some officials on the Alava road were carrying out a control of the transport on the N-1, where it was through the municipality of Arminón.
They insisted on stopping a van for the inspection when the driver, breaking orders, hurriedly crossed over the block.
The agents went to the chase until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometers, stopped on the road and its two occupants ran into a forest area.
Ertzaintza's agents were therefore able to arrest one of the fugitives and seize the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they carried and took note of once inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The hashish panels, which were located in the rear of the vehicle, were subsequently put under police custody for a thorough investigation and weight detection.
Moreover, since the officials found that the matrix was "doubled" because it did not match the one reported in the van documentation, the crime of falsification of public documents was also charged to the arrest.
Ertzaintza is continuing investigations to arrest the second suspect, who has managed to escape as mentioned above, and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old detainee A. A. J. was taken to the police station to conduct the appropriate procedures and to be available to the judge in the next few hours.
Arrests the actor Heather Locklear for guidance under the effect of medications
The actor Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw him perform risky maneuvers while trying to get out of the car from the parking lot in Montecito, as revealed in the magazine People by a spokesman for the California street.
The witness specified that around 4:30 p.m., Locklear "scarried the accelerator down, making a lot of noise, and trying to get the car out of the parking lot with push forwards and backwards. Making retromartage, he passed several times before his sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who had apparently not recognized the actress at first sight, saw that Locklear had stopped in a nearby street and had left the vehicle.
It was this person who was alarming emergency services, because "she was concerned about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actress sitting inside his vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"He seemed confused," and that's why the agents led him to a specialist drug and alcohol center to put him to a test.
According to a spokesperson of the police, the actress proved to be cooperative and the hypothesis of alcohol abuse was eliminated from the beginning, even though "as observed by the officers at first, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medication."
Locklear was arrested with the suspicion of driving under the effect of some non-best specified substance and was imprisoned in the local prison around 19:00, to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was restored by a specialist clinic in Arizona after being recovered after an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian IU federation to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The UI coordinator general and a member of the Izquierda Unida Party, Gaspar Llamazares, today confirmed that he would be in charge of the regional federation of training to take a decision on the case of the former advisor to the Youth and Sport of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the charge of clientelism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said about the resolution that the party will have to adopt in relation to what has been a civil counsellor to this day.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding the irregularities that Silva would have committed. "The UI has always wanted us to have the greatest transparency of this type of investigation."
In the same way, he stressed that training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public charges."
"Sangre de Mayo", Garci's epic bet
With inspiration from Episidios Nacionales of Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci is presenting in Sangre de Mayo the famous Spanish revolt against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his film, with almost EUR 15 million in the budget.
With this film, the director tried "to illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a large cast of interpreters.
Blood de Mayo, for more than two and a half hours, starts this Friday in the cinema halls, to become a television ministry in the future over four hours on TeleMadrid.
Great admirer of the literature of Galdós, Jose Luis Garci argues that he has realized "a dream of his childhood", and believes he should thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Madrid Community had commissioned him three years before turning a commemorative film for the second centenary of May 2rd. The director had agreed that the story of basses on the novel Episidios Nacionales.
The 15 million budgets allocated by the Madrid Community for Garci have been a "unique opportunity" to recreate the appropriate scenarios and customs to bring back a "stolen Spain which failed the choice of the leader to fight and the fact that the struggle for independence has led the people to a huge delay in development under Ferdinand VII's reign" observed Garci.
However, the register regrets that it did not receive funding equal to that of Alatrist or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than twice as much as Sangre de Mayo, so it was not possible to turn some of the scenes that he himself had signed with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost all his career.
This, for the return to start, influenced what is his usual work practice, the stage with the actors, with which he often uses to try to turn together with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "depressant," considering that "part of the work of the director resides in going to the theater and to the cinema to know what is happening in the field in which he works."
Many of the interpreters, part of whom are part of the Sangre de Mayo cast, try in front of their car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Candidate to Oscar for four times - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films candidates to represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy - its Blood de Mayo, Seven tables de billar francés and, the last selected Los girasolos blinds - do not represent the younger generation of Spanish cinema "that should instead be known."
Garci doesn't expect prizes from this movie.
"At first you think you work for posters, then you realize that you work only for prosperity, and at some point you conform to just turning a film into more," Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon recognizes the civil essence of the ballerina Tortola Valencia
A Civilian Ballerina brings honor to another ballerina as well as Seville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, father of Catalan (Firenze Tortola Ferrer) and mother of Andalusia (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), born in the Triana district, and at the age of three, moved with the family to London.
It was a free dance ballerina and a specialist in Oriental dances.
He led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of female emancipation, of the caliber of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, which marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I'd like to work with Pepa Gamboa, and she's offering me this character.
He maintains the ballerina: "We do not intend to tell his whole life, but to gather the spirit.
The titles of his dances suggested to me some basic elements of the flamenco.
So, "the dance of the bat" suggested me a guajira, or "the dance of the snake" some tanghi.
His dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing also comes into this aesthetic," he explains.
The stage includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will again sing Isabel in one of her shows, as she does in the "Open Door"; and that of Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with what she was a student.
"Matilde plays Adult Tortola, the character of maturity.
I am happy because he has agreed to work in my work and I feel very honored about this."
The arrangement also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi di Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who plays the role of eternal companion of these artists who have been all round, and who have always had many spasimants."
The work is in some ways also present the life of this woman in remote places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, since she normally lived in London.
"I wanted to remind her, because I think that she is one of the women who have had a huge influence in a given historical period and now no one remembers her and so much less considers her work as something of value" supports Bayon.
The show will start today at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega theatre.
With the publication of the "Dario de un un un reinhabited poet" also closes the Triennio
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Dario de un Poeta Reincasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities programmed by the Advisor to the Culture of the Andalusian Joint to celebrate the "Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of both.
Thus, the "Triennio di Zenobia and Juan Ramon" concludes with the re-editation of this work, with the International Congress held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Choco de Light", which was inaugurated last May and which, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, is expected to arrive in New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
In addition, the Advisor to the Culture of the Andalusian Joint has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Dario de un Poeta Reincasado", under the care of Peter Taberero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the spread of the figure and work of one of the highest-value Andalusian poets.
America likes a little less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of these."
The phrase is of actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de Malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all America, in front of the confusing idea that Newman left.
Yet it cost him a lot to deliver him an Oscar.
And since 2007, he's been retired.
And he also knew he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what a trial goes beyond any expression, and now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country could have been better thanks to its existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and homeland died at a particularly dark moment, for the fear of terrorists and the markets, with the autism of the American people on the ground, to the desperate search for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men are so helpless and are good people to admire, it does not need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, it was the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and lost causes, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of the first death of overdose to the creation of the food brand domestic and biological.
All gifts to a country where it is very expensive to go beyond a suicide food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without caring for either nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that a man was not killed, a time has come to an end.
Another Englishman, Sam Mendes, director of Oscar's award, said working with Newman was nothing less than the apex of his career.
The bad boy who came from Australia, Russell Crowe, became a gambler to define Paul Newman's greatest inspiration.
"He has left an example of a very high level for all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today try to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high consideration the need for justice and having a serious, private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today's media jungle.
However, some try and Paul Newman is a good example for them.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, who remained faithful even though he certainly did not lack the opportunity to be.
"Why am I going to eat out of hamburgers today, if I have a steak at home?" she used to joke.
In heaven he is accompanied by the pride that his daughters on earth are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he interpreted, none of them was as proud as that of a devoted husband, a loving father, a stubborn grandfather and a passionate philanthropy," they said.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will take place in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I'll say no!
They called it the "perfect course", but in my opinion it was far longer the worst thing I've ever seen.
A lot of jokes, which if they were then taken into account in the evaluation and I had to examine them, would be totally negative.
But let's go in order and start from the beginning.
The shocks began with the withdrawal of the back, which assumed it would go first.
It didn't seem like a bad idea, but if you're forced to go, it's just to pull everything back (including the chip to avoid the codes during the race).
Not at all.
You had to go just to take the back (first shock, go only for this) and (after the relative tail), surprise! they had only 'S' size shirts (second shock, because I need an XL size).
What world do we live in?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they have decided to buy only small shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like this are inescapable compared to the day of the race.
Besides having to go very soon to pick up the chip, the waiting line was 15 minutes and, more than that, you had to deposit the bag.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race to which more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as it was predictable, the race started that we had not even deposited the bag yet, although, once it was successful in the company, the recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the expectation of more than 40 minutes, to which attempts of popular rebellion and assaulted the stand were added.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will certainly have the pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even result in the correct classification due to the chip that, I suppose, did not record the arrival correctly.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, this will certainly not enter my mind.
So I think we'll keep dreaming of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft search receptionist (virtual)
At the MlT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft presented in advance a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case described by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move within the company campus) by assisting the phone user.
Thanks to a camera and a system of facial recognition, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people there are in a room, who are - including to remember their position in the company - and to listen and understand the key words in a conversation with them.
It can also group those present in groups of conversations.
In the video, for example, the receptionist detects a third person, but realizes that he does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
She asks her if she's there to visit someone and tells her she'll be at her disposal shortly.
Everything without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week we talked a lot about a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were equipped with essential and less commercial cleaning functions, they would go five times faster – hey! Steve, it will be for "the least".
All one discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows functionality and "extra".
The change of direction is acceptable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is becoming more and more important, and with it software.
When Google launched Chrome into the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for hardware and software to communicate.
Do the same for your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think about the "death" of the operating system, not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
You only take the computer to launch Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome - and we spend more time browsing online than in a remote window environment.
What are half the operating system applications used for?
It's less than that.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overload, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services to make it a valid alternative to Google.
They have a desperate need, in fact, and here I bring a small example.
I took the photograph inserted in this post in one of the recreation sites for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of this month.
On the drinking machine a folder urges them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study came to the conclusion that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to do online research.
Last week, the rest, was confirmed the delay in developing the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be placed on the market in the early months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The cell phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is painful.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso was taking her to the Azores coast, Leonardo di Caprio was in 'Diamante de blood' by Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino's 'Il Padrino' by Francis Ford Coppola as well as being part of the typical uniform of the gay muscle parish.
And if we try to list the appearances of the stars, we can reverse the image of the force with the pointed buffs that lift the weights in the ambulatory circuit.
This is essentially the typical man-made shirt, with the inside of cotton, lettuce and without sleeves.
It is the 'tank', as the Anglophones call it, even though the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel lies above all.
The "Marcel" excels above the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive scarf and for the small Belgian flag (unrecognizable), that the most emblematic models of the shirt carry as detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" excels above the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive scarf and for the small Belgian flag (unrecognizable), which the most emblematic magnet models carry as detail on the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian company does not only concern the famous 'tank'.
It also includes slippers for college, back boxer, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, sailors, baby-dolls, mini shorts...
Intimate clothing designed to be comfortable.
And it's a sin to use them as an intimate lingerie.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't care"
The great similarity with the sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, the sisters of Cruz have taken very seriously their new activities in the field of fashion.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who give their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that Mango has made of its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important prizes than the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Hot and shy, you win fast.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I designed for the autumn winter season in Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the opera in honour of Valentino.
Let's say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
From what elements does your new collection for Mango go into this fourth working season for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like the movie of the '60s, from here we come up with various inspirations.
Then they love to lose me in the city and watch women dress, as they combine and mix their clothes. I often do so.
Ballerina, actress and stylistic, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I believe that, even if at the end, everything is inconclusive and there are many elements in common.
To me, as a child, they liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to enjoy my aunt's arms and to see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the game park.
Then, once a ballerina, I've always paid a lot of attention to the dress.
It is known that dancers like to have their own style to go to lessons and the wise, to look at the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actresses, when you're delivered the watch is the time when you really meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for the stylists and the professions.
Not long ago, you were 30 years old, you got in trouble?
But not.
Never hear better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to absorb life by making less mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was little, and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So you're thinking of becoming a mother, right?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because she's asking me for my own body and I also want to be a young mom, I don't want to lose it.
As for the candidate, I don't care too much.
What I will do will be to give my son much happiness and to educate him with love.
As for the cinema, you're waiting for them to scan in the different rooms a few films turned over last year.
That's right, and I've got a lot to do to walk.
Being a woman coming from the theater, I am very impatient and anxious, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it can't always be that way.
I want you to eat "Last hour" and "Searching for the tomb of Christ."
Let's see if you like it.
A few days ago you debuted on the pass with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I was in a hallway like a model.
Just Naomi Campbell, who has known me for a long time, called me to go to London to participate in a charity show for her organization "Done for a better world" and the clothes we've worn – I brought two pieces of our collection for Mango – have been auctioned to collect funds for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know this nice side of Naomi.
They say so many things about you, that I know her for a long time I can confirm that I am not so true.
Besides, I'm with this good part in which she's involved.
He asked me to show up for a noble cause, but if he asked me to pee, I would have done it the same way.
If it's to help third-world women, you can't go back.
Recurrent drivers of alcoholism will have to install the "alcohol"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that drivers with three administrative sanctions for excessive blood alcohol, install in their car the system that prevents driving the vehicle in a state of emergency or if it does not explode in the device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the General Public Prosecutor of the State, according to which it will be a pilot project of the duration of one year.
The aim of this project is to reintegrate the driver, since this will have to be a rehabilitation course on the road.
In addition to the Directorate-General for Road Safety, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Technical Institute for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will take part in this initiative.
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of the drivers reported more than once for driving in a state of gravity then drive the car back.
The alcohol would avoid it, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the blown air and prevents you from driving the car if the driver does not breathe, or when a higher concentration of alcohol is detected than that allowed.
The cost is more than EUR 1000 and would be charged to the finer.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce to 65% of the offences committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to stop these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate their development, since legal reform can be carried out on a regular basis, and, without a doubt, the necessary reform for criminal proceedings would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, even if it has already been put into experimental use in some industrial and public vehicles.
It is just tomorrow that the Congress of Members will vote on a PSOE initiative which proposes to install this system on school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British punctuality, at 17.40 a.m., the second programme, the Spanish aircraft in which the Asturian principles were travelling landed in the presidential hangar at the airport Benito Juárez of Mexico City.
The sun was rising, but the rays still forced to use their hand as a sight to see the real couple coming down from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver, along the road, if he knew that the Spanish authorities were visiting the city to formalise an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you won't be able to go to the airport to load people at that moment... you're from here or...
No, sir, you're Spanish, but you've been here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who the Asturias principles are and the importance of the trip.
There are many waiting in the hangar of the airport with a red carpet and a military cord composed of 27 marine soldiers offering the salute of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the princess, calls to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps they reported that to Mexico City threatened the wrong time.
They give the photos a smile and a brief pause before going to the room where the official committee is waiting for them.
At the door of the hotel in which they live, one of the four largest in the city, a spiritual reporter of Mexican television awaits them.
The best prize offered by fashion
There is probably no place in the world more suitable to present a fashion prize, which is not Paris and there is probably no more delicious and bunt viman of Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talent in the fashion field.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his drawings in Mango's glass at the number 54 of Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost wept from emotion.
On the other hand, it is the company's second largest store in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first one is in London.
The many events, combined with the desire to please Valentine's styler who presided over the jury of the competition, started with a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the closeness of Chagal's most delicious TV, the presidential table of gala prepared by Mango was even more spectacular.
Born, with a broken heart and making a need for virtue, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a dress of the House and some ELAH complements to take away the fiate and arm of the son Luis - a girl almost two meters high - accompanied Valentino to the chairman of the dinner dinner.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango, did the house honors and the knight who ended up with the Barone Rotchil, without a jacket, because they both had given it to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who managed the shop in pants and shirts – designed by her hand – transformed into dinner, wearing a long, very sensual black dress and excitedly during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the work, when they showed us the room for ballet sages and you, remembering other times, grabbed a bar and knocked down a "great floor".
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the premises of the building, but had shown us the photos of his son on the cell phone before.
The following day we were happy for the presence of Olivier Martinez – another girl who moved on - and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with her armchairs, her towels and be assured in advance that there were no smells in her room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, it's life.
1001, the amount of stress
There are no 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and frenzy of daily life.
And as if this were not enough, they are all collected in a book that will bring the relaxation in the libraries on September 30th.
The wake is almost a punishment when it squeals every morning at 7:00 a.m. but it is even worse to imagine involved in the frenzy of modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer's bad back.
Stress is the worst of the twenty-first century.
However, there are no one or two methods to combat daily exhausting and fatigue to get rid of the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond the yoga positions, classical massage or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott collects all a "menu" of custom options for taste and time for each one in his book.
The anti-stress work is entitled "1001 ways to relax" and its calm will reach the libraries thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone thinks that it is impossible to gain peace in areas such as work or in personal relationships, this "manufacture" denies such conviction.
It also suggests alternative solutions, such as being in contact with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline doesn't run out in your veins to regain body balance and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, shut your mind and concentrate on reading.
Talk in the sleep
Some children talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very excited to tell us something that happened to them the day before, but to those children who speak are still asleep.
The first time that happens, at the most you take a scare, but actually it doesn't matter very much.
This is a benign alteration of sleep defined as sleepiness.
It occurs with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Certainly, most of you have told me that you have spoken in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur in a very sporadic way (once in life, for example, associated with a high fever episode) or with a greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child remembers nothing anymore.
There is no single reason to explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes episodes are related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, nightmares, night enuresis (doting the sleeping pipe), or sleepwalking, but not necessarily so.
As mentioned above, it can be associated with very high fever stages, stress situations or overcrowding.
In any case, it is a phenomenon that is not yet studied.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It may happen that the person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice, with words dissolved, almost in a whisper, or that the opposite happens (urla, scream, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, you should observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to check if there are any issues that are generating an abnormal state of anxiety as a result of the situation.
We have said that this is a benign alteration, so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if combined with insomnia or stress).
What can be done, however, is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before he goes to bed.
Offer quiet games and avoid TV programs or series that cause fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children who are tired of relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them to gain some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more quietly.
Once the dreamers appear to try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the day after it will remember nothing of what has happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because it's not aware of what's happening, and you're interrupting his sleep.
Although she's talking, she's sleeping and then she's resting.
Remember that if you appear very anxious and the episodes have a certain frequency, it is better to consult a doctor or check where this is due to such a great anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common situation), do not fall into the temptation to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because it's sleepy and therefore unconscious to organize your mind.
In addition, you are able to hear what he says but do not see what he is dreaming to say, so you need to pay close attention to the interpretation of the information and to the conclusions it might bring.
Never tell the child you can ask him questions during the night to know his secrets.
Not even for jokes.
Something like this is causing a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that takes just a few minutes.
Illhaeuern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found the road of victory in the house after a long frugal period.
Without playing a formidable game, the Yellow-Nears have created the largest number of network opportunities by transforming one into the game's victory.
The rhythm was not much supported during this meeting where the attackers expressed themselves tired.
After a first attempt by the captain of the Kauffmann host team who fired the seven with one shot away, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after the other caused the defense of Dannemarie, Fonderflick away, then Hirn high, Romain high and still Diebold.
The Dannemarie answered with a block in the middle of the field, leaving only the Riahi skate at the point of attack.
The beginning of the second time was decisive with two initial occasions signed by Riahi and Temporale for Denmark, and immediately after the first Marais network for the Illhaeusern, well-positioned, took up a ball rejected on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the Cannon of Illhaeusern will not be able to taste his happiness for a long time and will be released a dozen minutes after leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not cause great problems to the Illhaeuesern's Elevens, directed just to "strengthen" the defense, except in the final minutes of the game when, after a rocking action, the ball blew through.
Sarkozy meets fishermen in the hills
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a step in Britain.
Prior to the demonstration of fishermen who brutally prevented access to various British and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec on Tuesday morning in the Finistère department to charm the representatives.
They have promised to accept it "with constructive spirit" and hope that "they will be present with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place just at the same time as the general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by British fishermen in order to take action to address the increase in the price of gas, which reached its record with an average of more than EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to Eliseo's spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them possible solutions to help businesses regain competitiveness and to ensure the working conditions and the remuneration of the marines".
Fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy to stand by.
On Tuesday morning, they led the "lucky operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of ingestion.
The port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-île have not been interrupted.
A roadblock has been implemented on the Quiberon peninsula.
On Monday the marines have already proved their determination by burning, from dawn, tires and pallets in front of the fuel deposits at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while taking out demonstrations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and Manica, such as Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where the fishermen remained at the mill, or in Havre, where twenty boats prevented the movement of ships from trading.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, at the Atlantic Loira, interrupted the closure of the total finish note by Donges in the evening.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday to decide any action.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will, in fact, decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the possible participation in the meeting scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported the movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not give up" et "they do not intend to move to Paris", he announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, president of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on gas, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but estimate that the rate of return of a vessel is only reached with a gas of less than EUR 0,30 per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his home of Connecticut.
Hillary et Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and still Sam Mendes welcomed the legend of the film and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008
This year, the aircraft construction company has 215 deliveries, despite the threats of recession affecting the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth global company in the sector, maintains delivery forecasts for 2008 with delivery of 215 aircraft, confirmed its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first semester, he delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company is widely located in the Chinese market, particularly for aircraft of the range between 30 and 120 places.
So far, Embraer has delivered in eight years 41 flights to Chinese customers.
AIG would give up more than 15% of its activities
The American International Group's insurance company, set up by the American monetary authorities, would give up more than 15% of its business in order to repay the loan of $85 billion, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
The AIG is ready to consider the sale of most of its activities, in addition to the transfer of the insurance branches to the international market and the United States, states the newspaper on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The Board of Directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to consider any transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained at the AIG.
The activities that AIG intends to transfer include the International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% of the Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, adds the FT.
No final decision on such transfers has been taken, FT continues.
The AIG must quickly find liquidity in order to repay the loan of 85 billion granted by the Federal Reserve, at the expense of the US authorities having to borrow 80% of its capital.
Paris: chronistico Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic collapse Monday, after the House of Representatives expressed itself against Paulson's plan to save the financial institutions: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, i.e. a loss ever seen, approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) is finished at 10,365,45, below 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684,81 points) above that of 17 September 2001, the day of the reopening of the Stock Exchanges following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, the index of major technological titles, has lost 199,61 points closing at 1,983,73 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 has lost 8.81% (i.e. 106,85 points) closing at 1,106,55, at the definitive closing figures.
Demoralized at the beginning of the session, Wall Street is buried after the unperceived rejection of the bank's rescue plan, designed to bring stability to the markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favour, the representatives rejected the funding requested by Treasury Minister Henry Paulson.
About two Republicans on three have rejected the plan.
"It's a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
"All this indicates what the market was counting on the project," he added, fearing that in a few days it might be "too late" to adopt one.
"If the project were actually dying (...) then the witness would be quickly passed to the Fed – Federal Reserve – (the American Central Bank, ndr) and other central banks to resolve the crisis, which would further limit the credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, who was responsible for the financial and economic sector at the Global Insight.
And while still stressing the state of emergency," every day that leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, Piegga stressed.
After the failure of the Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of the Wachovia banking activities by the rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated rapidly, calling for urgent intervention in favour of the banks of the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets "are not only in the face of an American crisis, but in a global crisis", FTN Financial analyst added.
The compulsory market has gone up strongly.
The return of the Treasure's Goods with a 10-year maturity is reclaimed to 3,632%, against 3,827% of Friday night, while the 30-year maturity is 4,161%, against 4,357% of the previous day.
Obama benefits from the first television duel
After the first debate on Friday between the two candidates at the White House, here is a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Without any surprise, the general districts of the republican and democratic campaign proclaimed their victory of the television duel, followed by a third of American families.
Politologist David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although worthy, was not brilliant enough to allow him to slow down his five-week polls from the presidentials.
The Gallup Institute, of which a poll published on Saturday, offers a five-point advantage in Obama (49% against 44% for McCain), shows that the democrat had the best.
An instant survey conducted by CbsNews on a sample of undecided voters found that 39% of them consider Obama the winner, while 25% point on McCain.
A great performance by his partner Joe Biden, who waited during the first and only debated with rival Sarah Palin, should confirm on Thursday Obama's advantage.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
He's got a good insight," said Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventeen McCain has never stopped promoting his indisputable experience in foreign policy, stressing the "ingenuity" of the adversary regarding the arguments raised during the first face-to-face.
Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that.. he has often said many times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and the skills needed to become president" he assured.
What is a constant target for the Republican television campaign yesterday.
Obama, for his part, stressed how his election would represent a new future.
Without extending, it proved to be clear and accurate.
It has promoted its predisposition to the right decisions and its intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
"McCain has never understood, contrary to Obama," he reiterated, this weekend, a democratic spot, reprobating the Republic that he has not taken the necessary measures to deal with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety-nine minutes of debate, John McCain had much to say about me, but nothing about you, yesterday, Obama, before 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, under a rainy rain, for an election meeting.
He has not even spoken the words "medium class" or "workers". The financial crisis goes to Obama, considered by the Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the edge of the precipitation.
"The next week could be a decisive move," the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer considered yesterday.
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of Clinton's administration, compared Obama's economic interest to that demonstrated by Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998.
For the democratic candidate, the current strike "is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reducing the intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street's results, the Illinois Senator also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of a country's potential energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a park of 45 nuclear centres by 2030.
With caution, the two candidates raised their financial rescue-oriented questions of 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros) last night adopted the Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice that there were elections?"
Young people and opponents protested on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to challenge the results of the legislation in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered Sunday evening after the closing of the electoral seats in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While the results were still awaiting, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "the dictator, resignations".
Some people admit that they have not even voted: "To what purpose? They will do what they want, of my vote," says one boy.
They do not believe that the regime which has made a fine figure for external observers in order to resume dialogue with the European Union is ready to take a democratic step.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of goods, could be lifted if these elections were considered legitimate by observers.
I didn't, according to the opposition.
"We have been removed from the electoral committees and our observers have not been able to take part in the vote," said Iour Potemkine, spokesperson of the Union of the Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It's a face-to-face change, says Alexandre Milinkievitch, former candidate for the opposition to the 2006 presidentials and chief of the pro-European movement, because the important one is who counts the cards and in this case is the executive.
If opposition Members enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament can involve a television area, regional meetings and legislative proposals."
The opposition therefore has the duty to enter the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union needs to be started.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in crisis, and we do not provide any reform, we are at risk of becoming a Russian protector.
Now we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the ‘safety and cooperation organisation in Europe which has followed the electoral process recognises the validity of the vote.
It underlines that the participation rates seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of the voters in Minsk) has led to all kinds of manipulation.
"Did you notice that there were elections? Asking the social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one in the election seats.
And there will be at least five Members of the opposition to Parliament, those most convenient to power."
The night silence falls on the square of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Committee are pleased with their success.
Meeting - Blood is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday the tenth anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. FrancineDécary, had every reason to rejoice, since Hema-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, he has regained the confidence of the public, seriously removed from the scandal of the infected blood between 1980 and 1990.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
In the face of such a drama and the protests of the population, the Government of Canada conducted a public investigation in February 1994 , led by Judge Horace Krever, which sought to highlight the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent the recurrence of such a disaster.
While the judge Krever was delaying a report, some provinces set up a committee with the aim of designing a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the reports of Gélineau et Krever, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to provide Québec and the Canadian Blood Society (Canada Blood Society) for all other provinces and territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Québec started its activities, 38% of the people said that they still had confidence in the system of donations in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalled.
The situation was deadly.
Thanks to the continued efforts to improve the safety of blood transfusions and the field research over the years, we have regained public confidence," he explains before saying proudly that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Québec population now had confidence in Hema-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary is convinced that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases in Europe of the human variant of the crazy cow, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which has been in the presidency since 1998, the year of the foundation.
"And we didn't know at all if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It is therefore based on one of the main recommendations of Krever and Gélinau's reports, according to which when you have doubts and you might get a serious disease, in this case the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which occurs with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, is taken of exclusion measures.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than one month in the United Kingdom was rejected.
Now, for a few years, it has been shown that there is no doubt that this disease is transmitted through infected blood.
This episode has shown us so that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999 a much more efficient technique for HIV identification appeared on the market: nuclear acid (TAN) tests that allowed the presence of the virus directly in the donor blood and not in antibodies against it, on which the tests used until then were based.
The TANs have allowed the window period to be reduced, i.e. since the person contracted the disease to the extent that the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, the specialist explains.
That period could be reduced to less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and not being able to identify them is thus significantly reduced.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of countering AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, a person of 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, this means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone is infected by the HIV virus.
Since Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood samples each year, there will be more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted with a transfusion.
I believe that today you can feel calm in receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health, says the head of the Hema-Quebec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than a year ago, Chikungunya virus appeared on the Réunion Island that, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted to the blood by an insect.
It must be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary before stressing that in addition to having safe resources, Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient resources.
"The needs are increasing because the population is ageing.
Because of the more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a contribution of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the number of donors, which on average represents only 3% of the inhabitants of Québec acceptable as donors."
However, all healthy people who are 18 years old and who meet the eligibility criteria can give blood every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of the people offering themselves as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a country where the latter is disseminated, they will be rejected for a period of one year.
"With this 3% we can keep an inventory capable of meeting the needs of hospitals.
The cases of distress are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this group of donors as they age and cannot make any more donations.
It is now difficult to convince people to give blood, but above all to hold them and to encourage them to become regular donors.
Today's life is so frenzy that you find it difficult to give blood for an hour," says desolate Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec not only distributes blood samples, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, eyeball valves and skin that are used almost exclusively for serious rashes.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being deposited at Hema-Québec that manages the only public bank of the blood of umbelic cordon in Quebec.
In the umbelic cord, which once was considered a biomedical discharge, there is plenty of blood rich in stem cells that can serve to cure serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the insertion into the bank of our thousandth blood sample of cordon and we expect to take more than a thousand each year.
You should begin to propose them for the transplants at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this practice of taking blood from cordon as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that you cannot have access," because Hema-Québec does not have the means necessary to propose this complex and costly program in all Québec hospitals.
Calcium - The impact in semi-finals
The Montréal Impact qualified for the semi-finals of the A series, winning 3-1 against Seattle's Sounders, yesterday, during a second decisive match of the final quarters, at the Saputo Stadium.
The central campaigner Antonio Ribeiro, marked the final goal at 90'.
After a first time without aim from both sides, David Texto and Rocco Placentino signed the subsequent networks for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to mark Matt Jordan.
We remember that at the first round of the return trip on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in semi-finals.
Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunderler completed a first 3-1 in the return match winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still take part in the semi-final.
The impact will have to deal with both the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed in the day.
In short - decisive network of Kovalev
Canadians and their axes are ready to begin the season.
The trio formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive phase of the game winning 3-2 against Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first meeting, marked a goal, made two steps, and collected a passage for victory, in the quarter of the Hab preparatory games.
I decided for the victory the only network signed by Kovalev.
"I'm not ready yet, he warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel at ease."
"He tried to punish in the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a good ovation."
Charest Point North
The Prime Minister shall not exclude the opening of the elections before the end of the year.
Finally, Jean Charest met yesterday in Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left) tried to elect himself during today's partial elections.
"Enlarge the borders of our last large northern border": this long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented yesterday in Levis, through instruments from the strong visual impact, at the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
After him, during his speech, the projection of a kind of "Mulino to images".
On three max screens, they were confused by the spectacular negative hydroelectric digs, mining cultivations, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large means as in the full electoral campaign.
During the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to exclude the opening of the autumn elections, even though he noted that he was very busy.
The "Nord Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on labour, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often appointed in the most recent speeches by the Prime Minister, the opening of the North- northern territory to the 49th parallel- was never the subject of a presentation.
However, the prime minister was limited to explaining why the North would be "a joy from the immense potential", but he did not speak about timing or investment quotas, nor did he explain the precise priorities in the implementation of future projects.
More and more, it has been limited to point out what it considers to be a priority: hydroelectricity, forests, but especially the mining sector, which has experienced various improvements as a result of the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
Standing on Charest's list, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
That "great territory doubles France", is here, is Quebec.
Not only is he here, but he's insistent on us," he insisted, as he wanted to encourage a mythical national founder.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the Fever of Gold in Abitib, the National Engineering, the Bay of James.
"It's up to us, it's our future," he added, after a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map on his back.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, has specified the prime minister during the press conference.
"It is a traditionally maintained position by all governments.
There is a border line on which no agreement has been in force for a long time and, when the opportunity arises, I will reiterate that position on behalf of the government," he said.
In other words, considering climate change, the North needs to be reassessed," he said, talking about the transition from the northwest, which will be open throughout the year due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister considers that occupying the territory is a duty."
And the inhabitants of the place, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The prime minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very careful about this and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létoureau (former member of the PQ d'Ungava), have already given way to consulting a thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transports and Natural Resources) has taken on an important role, has started work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting, not necessarily a summit, but a moment when "common visions will be provided"
The development of the North would, in the rest, be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be concerted, ordered and will respect the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the first liberal ministers who preceded it.
"As the liberals who have preceded us, we know how to distinguish ourselves to transform the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the party's head.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to reinstate the Beauharnois Central in Diga Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, Creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who nationalized hydroelectricity, to Burassa, Creator of Bay James, our party has always been able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963, used another reference, conservative this time, the program "Road to the North" program.
Faced with the project concerning the hydroelectric dam of Eastmain1a-Ruper, Charest stated that its deployment would be planned for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel we'll do it," he confessed to his militants, causing a lot of applause.
In fact, the prime minister, who said in April there would have been no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not break the chance to start a poll in autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
It underlines that it is certainly very committed, in particular in a mission of the federal council in China and at the summit of Quebec-New York.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal Chapter with a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular of the "constitutional aspirations" that have passed leave like oil: the PLQ in particular calls for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that Quebec will appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that the latter will have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
With regard to the opposition, the text of the Northern Plan was accepted in a skeptical manner.
The leader of the PQ, Pauline Marois, resuspended the North Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to you, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not respect its application.
If we had done so, we would have made progress today" said Marois next to Jean-Talon's candidate (scripture today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has stated to support the adoption of the North Plan by the government.
"What we hope for is that all this is not simply perceived as a show," said the leader Sébastien Proulx, replaced by Mario Dumont, back in today's holidays.
Letter - A Dishonored Country
It was Vic Toews, former Minister of the "Justice" (Ironia of the Future) of the Harper Cabinet, to allow himself to state, last summer, that Louise Arbor was a "glory" for Canada.
Dishonoring in this way a woman who has fought incessantly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about both the Prime Minister's entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are in front of a government that is the only, among all the Western countries involved, not to have repatriated a citizen held in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a simple teenager at the time the alleged facts occurred.
The only government that, despite having signed the Geneva Convention, has refused its word and lets a child-soldier walk in inhuman conditions.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
We recall, as an information tool, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Attorneys' Order, in particular, invoke Omar Khadaf's return so that it can be subjected to a regular process in Canada.
It is exactly the same government that closes its eyes to torture: it matters very little that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of overcrowding.
We do not realize it yet, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and "democracy", a word that Harper does not stop coughing and that sounds so crazy about his lips.
Here we come at a time when there is no more morals: one can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a head of government until today's minority (to see what will be after October 14 ...).
Many voters believe that a party preaching the Virtú, respect for the Law and the Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
It is here that shame, Mr Toews, in giving up all this, and nowhere else.
Free Opinions - The Orwellian Speech of Barrick Gold
In the September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice-president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, the latter states that the world's largest auriff company has sported a querela for defamation by six million against three authors and a small square editorial house with the intention of starting a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of a desire for defamation, but the law.
Without any surprise, this substantial difference is completely hidden from Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who supported a position contrary to his own.
Little matter the outcome of the process, writers and editor of the book Canada Nero will have to spend a sum of money in order to organize their own defense and fight, with decisively learned weapons, against an army of lawyers funded by the pockets practically without the bottom of the mining company.
Furthermore, in these fights with learned weapons, the tactic is often that of ruining the agreed rule in order to impose a consensus rule that would impose the opposition in addition to scare anyone else to speak again on the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was first of all the public opinion that should have presented its own vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is happening in many countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada, debates are usually conducted with exchange of views and not with manganese impacts.
It would therefore be sufficient for the company to open its books, its documents and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the funding of independent research teams that could shed light on the matter.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to be too confident in public opinion and badly rejects requests and letters in support of the authors of Canada Black.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a public debate" when his contempt for the same public is obvious?
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word only indicates those lawyers who are highly paid and not all of the Canadians; here is a rather narrow vision of the concept.
In a democratic system, even the negotiators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold does not understand – or does not want to understand – is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Canada Nero does so first because it rejects the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civil exchange of opinion, and not in the light of what many see as a sort of packaging (researching the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Canada Nero an ultimate to them in an attempt to suspend the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver's surreal speech, the desirable sport by Barrack Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of the truth, indispensable in every democratic society.
It rejects the right to quote authentic sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss the arguments of the richest companies in the world, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards as the authors of Canada Black do.
He has the right to reproduce.
For a long time, the university environment, which we are part of, has been able to deal with debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
The excessive measures of Barrick Gold clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it does not seek a transparent debate at all.
This is the end of the university world, as is the case with the same public debate in Canada, and it is now time for governments to take measures to limit the abuses.
Operation - Rescue for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the Congress's capitals, representatives of the republican and democratic escalation, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the greatest saving-financial level after the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the 700 billion-dollar US dollar plan, which aims to put a stop to the financial crisis that has been on Wall Street for months, still needs to be ratified by the two Houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for: verify its effective implementation by the elected leaders, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for failure to pay, as well as an inspection right to pay to the managers of the protected companies.
The American secretary to the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the chairman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the representative of the Republican Chamber of Negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day trial marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an effective agreement on markets," said the director of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"Every decision has been taken in such a way as to safeguard the economy and the American people from the current crisis at Wall Street," the democrat explained.
"It's the crucial point: if we hadn't acted in this way, unestimable discomforts and disturbances would have turned on the daily lives of Americans," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new failure on investors.
The time limit agreed was for the opening of the markets this morning.
After the negotiations, the two candidates to the US Presidency proved rather favourable to the agreement, but did not prevent them from expressing their discontent in advance of the adoption of extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama deserves to have added some provisions to the agreement, in particular that will enable owners to maintain their home and that inherent to the payments to the heads of undertakings covered by the State.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American TV screen.
Interviewed on another channel to find out if he will vote in favour of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to analyze the details, but I hope so."
"Being as I read, it's something that we all need to digest and that will allow us to move forward"
The option of a non-intervention is simply unacceptable," he said.
The 700 billion-dollar plan is aimed at repurchasing the taxpayer's money into doubt, risk-and-invenient assets of the US financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the outbreak of a real estate bubble that has led first to the collapse of mortgage loans at risk (mutuals) and then to extend to other more common forms of credit securities (CCAA) and to settle in the freezing of liquidity and the disbanding of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in charge of airing the first draft agreement last week.
It seems that it has been out of that blind alley since the Democrats have agreed that the active "tossic" of some companies in difficulty is only protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone at the Congress, a provision was added that if the government had to face losses during the five-year period due to this programme, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which another 100 billion can be added if the President so decides.
The provision of 350 billion should be ratified by a further vote of the Congress.
In exchange for its aid, Washington will receive shares of participation in protected companies that will receive dividends in case of profit and that will be able to recover when the waters have calmed down.
As set out in the plan, the federal government will have the possibility to delay the valuation procedures for real estate loans and to set limits on the remuneration and indemnity paid to the managers of the undertakings involved.
As of today, the architects of the plan would like to submit it to the vote of the House of Representatives, and to the vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it is not yet certain that the free course will be given to their plan.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the project, both in the republican and democratic setting.
"Of course, Washington doesn't feel you," he said to his voters, the Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the Chamber's Finance Committee.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But of course you don't take advantage of the taxpayers.
Leader of a small group at Congress named "the caucus of skeptics", democratic representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economic professors, including three Nobel Prizes, have written us to say: we ask Congress not to draw hasty conclusions and to carefully examine the way to be taken," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, once again, there was evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas found that it would have renounced its competitor's purchase, in full failure after the loss of EUR 2 billion ($2.9 billion) for the risk-risk mortgage crisis in the United States.
Fortis has 85 000 employees and is part of the largest twenty banks in Europe and the ten largest insurers.
"It's not the lost money, said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
On the other hand, there is a risk of influence and voting in banking matters.
It's certainly something that the savers and the families now appreciate that the times are certain"
During this period, on the other side of Manica, the British government seems to nationalize another bank in the bank for the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would charge all of the loans currently being made at the Bradford and Bringley bank, of which more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will be you to buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
From the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalisation by the English government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a busy icon
The beauty of the blue eyes was for a long time its axis in the sleeve, for others its weak point.
Did you get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor from the ambulatory smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and obvious talent would have driven him out of that circle of powerful devotees to true sacred monsters.
What a burden!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at the age of 83, in his Connecticut ranch, after a lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the past few years.
Less monumental of Brando, which he resembled and of which he longed to be a kind of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but he also spoke of freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
The mixed couples often give birth to magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 by a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origins.
From these European roots one of the glorious visions of the American dream will be born.
A humble ego, the last quality mark.
Because in him there was a whole country recognized by the safe made man, the fighter of the Pacific war, pride in fighting, which at the beginning of the 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale, later attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing at the theater, in television and soon at the cinema.
The same militant man for civil rights was also the driver who classified himself according to the 24 hours of Mans in 1979, as well as six symbols, although part of a couple model since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward.
If they go with him the shadow areas of a reserved, discreet, engaged, allergic to the scandals of the show-business, of which you will never be able to fully reveal the mystery.
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
This weekend Paul Newman's disappearance was a heart attack for filmmakers, while his great characters popularize the black screen of memories.
Over half a century of American cinema in full transformation is proposed through its interpretations.
The fascinating cow-boy of Butch Cassidy (1969) and the boy unable to wish the focus wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the roof that was adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember him in the arms of the sensitive Mr Bridge (1990), disturbed by a marriage that did not keep what he had promised.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone to history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, a criminal, tortured, violent, unforgivable in Loso loves me, by Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean and taken back after his death, who officially launched Newman in 1956.
That nice bad guy in the excellent Stangata, Oscar as the best movie in 1973.
A bitter and vindictive billiard player in Los Spacone, the magnificent film by Robert Rossen (1961), the color of Martin Scorsese's money, which won him the only Oscar on 9 nominations in 1987.
That face over the years, it was his.
Even him.
The times happen through its path.
Young people know him especially for the cult movement Slap Shot-Colpo dry by George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, coach of a hockey team on low-orthodox ice.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, brothers Coen.
The circle was closed with a last role as the father of the Irish mafia in my father's era in 2003.
Unlike the most legends of the film that soon abandoned the trade, Newman will remain long in the halls, reporting Hollywood throughout his party, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French filmmaker, defined it, with a point of irony, "a living challenge to underplaying", judging you to exaggerate your performance.
The profession was not always a game for the beautiful Paul Newman, to which the roles seemed to fall like a mannequin from heaven.
However, he often preferred the role of the marginalate to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, alcoholized or desperate, of which he expressed exasperation and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a record, Newman revealed unknown shades of his true, sensitiveness.
The first time Jennifer, in 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with Joanne Woodward's wife in the role of the protagonist, was drawing a subtle female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost Scott's son for an overdose, dedicated the movie Harry and Son to him in 1984, discreet and sad.
Among the countless tributes spent yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old gunmate Robert Redford (they read together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) said with infinite sadness "His presence made my life and this country better."
Generosity and love for life, two great characteristics of the missing actor.
Beyond a career of legend, a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protestant of the Hollywood derivatives, is being launched.
We would have starved his face to spit on bottles of acet, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging him as a bad choice of taste, although born as gag.
However, the proceeds of those sales were destined for his Childhood Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, instead of adjusting to his myth, chose to commit to the end.
He left to his five daughters a letter that he said "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
Try it, it was a privilege."
And it was also a privilege for us to follow the path of such a clean and generous American artist.
Citizens model, then, and much more.
What was produced in Zuschlag & partners' invoice factory?
In the meantime, on 8 October, the hearing of the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates will be discussed.
The political man and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed under a criminal association that has caused considerable damage, and other crimes, including document counterfeiting.
According to the Procurator, the money obtained from competitive bands was used by them for private purposes, and they have often certified the performance of the activities through false invoices.
The state and municipal money, in total 65 million flowers, is ended partly in the banks of the Fiatal Balldal organization, partly in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, made known by the investigating authorities, they have received the money obtained from tendering companies on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and the associations have never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
To do so, invoice blocks were purchased on the Józsefváros market, but circular stamps were manufactured in Kisunalas.
And in order to decide on the name of which companies to issue the invoices, it was established amongst others during the trip between the hills above the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the confession of the latter, he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for invoices for consumption, on the model of these, then invoices were prepared to be added to the competition bands, among other things those of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
Most of these are works by István Lados and András Õri which, according to our information, has drawn up the reports necessary to obtain the funding.
One of the choices of Lados' "travel studies" was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and his associates in 2003, the restaurant provided food for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
But so many people, as the restaurant says, would not all go to the place together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 at the Jobb Jövʹért Foundation, hereinafter referred to as Együtt in Harmadik Évesredért, is a stamp of formal errors and content.
One Badacsonytomaj pension has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay overnight, but there were 130 guests in the bill.
But the collectors of invoices full of fantasy have exaggerated when they reported the Pigal Kft., this also deals with a restaurant, in which accounting - according to the information issued to the judicial authorities - did not even appear the documents on behalf of the companies Job Jöv ürt and Hoppá.
The company's administrator, Gygzz, said to hvg.hu that when he was summoned to search and showed him the invoices, he immediately realized that it was false documents.
"On the stamp the name and the Iva game of our company were at a wrong point."
He added: In addition to the formal reasons, there was no return to the fact that, according to the bill, hundreds of people were accommodated, when they had eleven rooms in total and there were not so many beds.
By the way, the bill was a restaurant and their restaurant is no longer in function for a long time.
Billing agents did not worry about informing themselves that the Budapest travel agency of their choice, organizes only travel abroad, so they were shocked to indicate on the invoice with payment in cash trips in Hungary, which did not agree with the company's billing practice.
In addition, as demonstrated during the investigation, the invoice also included Iva, while the travel activity to countries outside the European Union is exempt Iva.
Among other things, the amount of Iva was wrong on the four documents issued by Hotel Réfülöp Kft. in favour of the Jobb Jövʹért Foundation, in fact on the services offered by the company it had to apply Iva to 15% and not to 25% as indicated on the invoices, as well as the hotel employees only issued printed invoices, while the invoice manufactured was written by hand.
In addition, the "issuers" have ruined other invoices, in the case of a company they have indicated as the activity carried out on the road freight transport, as is known from the proceedings of the Prosecutor, activities which were not carried out by the company originally founded for investment advice.
In addition, for formal defects - caused by non-conformity invoice format, false stamp - it was discovered that the invoices issued in favour of Együtt to Harmadik Évesredért Alapítvány, of twenty-one. Századi Culturalis Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue the invoices in question.
The falsifiers have not even paid attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület, that is why the company's liquidator, according to our information, refused to issue that invoice.
They issued invoices knowingly
Another group of invoice issuers consists of those who were aware of the need to issue invoices.
The Esély Budapest Alapitvány Foundation issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Balldal - Ifjú Szocialisták for the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évesredert of almost 4 million flowers.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, has persuaded the director of the Kft. Colllab to issue fiction invoices.
He collaborated with Zuschlag and also with the Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices issued for a value of about 5 million flowers at the Job Jöv¢ért Alapitvány Foundation, the Atlas Egyesület Association and the Vörösfenny Association, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Not even a movement of money because the invoices were then torn down, but the associations forgot to make this look in their documents.
In the following group of invoices issuing companies belong to those who are related to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized to rescue the Director General of the Delta Trió Kft, with headquarters in Budapest but not detectable there, which deals with fuel trade and motor vehicles.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 concerning the sale of software for a value of approximately 18 million flowers.
According to data from the investigation, the Cash Investment Kft. of Kisunalas has purchased these invoices since 14 September 2005.
The Director-General of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov would have forwarded the documents concerning the company between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov, during the investigation, has acknowledged that he has issued invoices on behalf of the company to Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért Alapitvány and the controvalor has been taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian wallors founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, in fact none of the companies were operational, because according to the defendant they had not received a job.
However, companies have become useful to them because at the request of the co-sponsor Zsolt Szente, editor of the company's founding documents, invoices were issued on behalf of the companies to associations linked to Zuschlag: Atlasz and Y-Generació.
On behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov issued to the various companies 15 invoices for a total value of 14.2 million flowers.
The investigation considers that Kubatov has invested 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as Iva.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fiction invoices, manufactured for the Biztos Pont competition band.
Y-Generación and Sövetség in Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 presented a band for the public utility agency of the Socialist Party, Tancsics Mihaly Alapitvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 head flowers but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the band.
To prevent this from happening, they presented to the TMA five fiction invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found during the search of the office of Arpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Public Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants, as they have already been looking for, will probably refer to the progress in the production of the invoices.
However, the most interesting thing could be if the defendant number one, János Zuschlag, decided to raise the veil over everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and even though he has promised to speak more widely, he has not yet done so.
It should be seen whether it is in his interest, it could also be that the Socialists have entered into agreements with Zusi, which - in exchange for a 50 million flowers, much of the damage - would be willing to do the spying cap.
For now, Zuschlag could also have resisted the fact that his requests for relief of his prison conditions, namely the granting of house arrests, have not yet been met.
While the authors of non-reparable and causing much greater damage can freely walk or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which has not been granted to him.
The psychology of over-licence: why spend more money?
The buyers are willing to spend more, to overestimate the goods.
Neurologists and economists researchers at the University of New York have been able to discover the neuro-economic bases of this well-known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study on Science magazine, men don't want to stay back in a race like the eBay auction, so they're also available to pay a higher price.
The research has tried to trace the nervous scheme of this "lot" at the level of the nervous system through experimental approaches.
One group of volunteers played the game, the other group of players participated in an auction, while the functional magnetic resonance method (fMRI) examined the active areas of the brain of the participants in the experiment.
In both games participants could win money, but in the game of auction, in which the essential element is to bid more than the other, the body stretched under the brain cortex goes into function intensively when it loses the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "self-gratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to researchers, the rise in price is explained by scanning the actual reaction of the stretched body.
In support of their theory, the research group’s economists conducted a financial investigation.
In this investigation, three groups have appealed against a partner under different conditions.
The control group reported the actual value of the product concerned and made their point.
In addition to this, they promised that in the event of a win, they would receive another $15 prize.
The third group would have received $15 before the auction, but the members of the group would have lost the money if the auction was lost.
The difference between the two groups consisted in the fact that for one of them, the gain was underlined, and for the other, the loss.
Checking the hypothesis of neurologists the members of the group that played "against loss" were willing to make higher scores of the control group or "winting".
"These results are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
In fact, these so far explained the phenomena that are susceptible to the shocks with the joy of winning and avoiding the risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image helped resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we came to a third explanation" - said Andrew Schutter, professor of the Faculty of Economics of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when should you talk to your doctor?
Almost half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, but in Hungary, chronic liver diseases are mentioned among the first causes of death.
In Hungary, the number of hepatitis patients goes up to a hundred thousand, of which only 7000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know how to be infected.
The liver definition is the collective name of infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities between symptoms, typical are hepatitis and itteracy, but their pathogens and diseases differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen agent: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g. water and infected foods), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal loss, saliva).
For those travelling it is useful to immunise against the A and B virus, against the C no vaccine exists.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating infected foods, accompanied by general illness, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After they form yellow spots on the skin and on the white of the eyes, the faeces become clear and the dark urine, the healing takes place within two or three weeks.
A million people die every year worldwide for hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, causing liver tumors and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason, according to the estimates, is that only one person in ten receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver tumors.
Most of the infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because the pathogens destroy the liver cells in a subtle way, in many cases the first symptoms occur 20-30 years later.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent and perform regular medical tests.
This disease is much more frequent than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattoos.
In the world today, the number of people infected by chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Since a routine laboratory test also reveals the disease, it is worth addressing the family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, so it stops the infectious power and can prevent the formation of tumors.
September 30 is the world's day of hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 worldwide by associations of patients.
The aim is to draw attention to viral chronic hepatitis, to the causes of its development and to the early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feel less pain?
According to a recent survey, religious faith works as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God affects the feeling of pain, reported British Telegraph.
In the somewhat bizarre investigation, an electroshock was performed to 12 Catholic believers and to other atheists, while all who observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
Based on the results, Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploration technique of the human brain, it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for controlling the pain.
The test is the first of a series of research in which, in addition to academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians of the University also take part.
The test took place exactly like this: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrat and the Lady with Leonardo da Vinci hermelin painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary originated a sort of religious status among the believers, while Leonardo's framework was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and considered it to be a calming effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this era of time they received 20 electroshock in four consecutive series, while observing either the painting on a religious theme or the other.
The Catholics reported that the virgin Mary's vision made them feel "sure", as if "someone would take care of them" and "they were calmed and were overcome by peace".
Looking at the religious theme image, they accounted for 12% less pain than when they had before themselves the work of Leonardo.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image of the strong effect even for atheists, but you need to find the right image.
"We need to look for an image to which they feed very positive feelings, like a mother or a father" - said the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright was pleased with the search.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it succeeds in changing our personality." - Wright added.
After the excellent results, only the question remains, if the believer is presented the painting of a lady of Leonardo or another painter of such a caliber, what effect could it have on the control of the pain?
Would the vision of a quality virgin Mary bring better results?
You're what you're saying about yourself.
On the day of the tenth birthday, Google can claim to be in the pockets of people as well as in heaven above their heads; he knows where they spent their holidays, which ambulatory they attend and what interests them.
However, Eric Schmidt, one of the company's directors, is not enough.
What concerns the skeptics who compare with the Orwellian incubation, they do not actually see the substance of web 2.0.
Recently, Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google's main purpose is to collect as many personal data as possible from its users, and this is necessary to meet the original goal of Google's founders that was: "let's insert all the information in a system of the world!".
According to Google’s director, after 10 years of revolutionary work, the company is still in the process of managing all the information.
To ask what would happen in five years Schmidt answered: he would like to know if Google could answer questions like "What am I doing tomorrow?" or "what would be the work that I would do?", but software doesn't know how to answer apparently simple questions because they don't know enough about users.
Not all netizens are aware that the exact words they search for are recorded during their Internet searches, from which IP address they are searched and on which page the interested persons stop after the search.
Through the Personalized Search launched two years ago users can store their browsing history, they can relate to what they have looked for and clicked on, these long-term results will generate much better results; on this same logic it is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services based on our stated and previously registered preferences.
What happens if my data is used against me, if they see what I'm doing? - the concerned users of the Google data monopoly are asked.
In most cases, the counter-reactions of the natives are caused by the fear of the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not by the sense of guilt, for the fear of punishment, for the desire of freedom or even for the rebellion of power.
One fact is, however, confirmed and that all the sought expressions are not only recorded but in motivated cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of the residents.
The most outstanding example of this in recent times has perhaps been the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google has forwarded to the Brazilian government information that has enabled the identification of pedophiles from the site of the Orkut community maintained by Google.
People who are concerned about personal rights have, on the other hand, been relieved in May when the company - in agreement with the EFF's electronic legal protection association - has successfully demonstrated the truth in court against the FBI: neither can you force Google with any point of the constitution to provide any information required by the FBI in secret.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully ripped down nearly 50,000 web addresses and thousands of search terms related to the confirmation of the child protection law approved years ago, but failed to obtain the search lists of individual users and the full list of web pages and keywords of two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore rather contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data spread Google because they believe that this is how their private sphere is affected and private life begins to use the services and rise with the rebellion of multinationals who are looking for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and the proliferation of enthusiasts, activists and users of computer appeared in many countries see in them the future generation of large companies, the "cool corporation", contrary to their rival, the Microsoft liquidated as the world conqueror because of Windows, because they both fight for the same goal.
This may happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for their services, the source code kept always updated and the software package is much more accessible, youthful and cool of the official software loop practice.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problem relationship between personal rights and the Internet, which implies one of the key words that have been repeated more often in recent years, web 2.0.
The Web 2.0 speaks of nothing but collaboration, leaving intentionally traces behind us and taking advantage of the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: show us ourselves.
A young medium can create profiles in several community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can connect them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists its musical tastes, all of which can include them in systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs about which automatically appear its most recent photo galleries stored on Flickr or Picasa.
Meanwhile, we read a number of examples from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning from the common friends tour, comes to know easily who spent the night with her faithful boy or a company can fire her employee because she wrote a sincere opinion on the company's top: one thing is sure, the concept of private life now has been completely reconsidered.
Whoever lives an online life does so to show himself and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that hides behind the behavior of young people.
Whoever wants to hide something or just wants to avoid Google's monopoly can do it (for example, starting with Scroogle using Google's search system but at the same time leaving no traces voluntarily).
There are not few people who do not register on community pages to be found, Google's online applications, from the preparation of texts to image management and news collection, can be replaced with alternative versions that are not linked to huge server parks and that do not make up our best profile so far.
Public opinion doesn't even expect so much in secret when Google will pull out the joints.
Currently, the company with its 156 billion dollars worth more than the IBM ($14 billion), the Intel (124 billion dollars) or the Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), the AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threaten the entrances of advertising agencies, the services introduced in record-time cause not only Microsoft but also many software development companies.
However, critical observers besides all of this find alarming points: the corporate summit, for example, has completely rejected the protest of the employees after doubled the right of corporate asylum, has considered it too costly to repeat the daily restaurant to the satisfaction of the employees, all of which, however, undermines the fact that in 2006 Google has given the lead to the Chinese government and in accordance with their agreement, the company will filter all the results that offend the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal rule of the company seems to be not to publish a new service in advance, but only when it will be useful, one thing is certain, that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will move the world in one point: while some believe that the project of scanning and archiving of books and magazines from Google will take on proportions such that the company will soon find itself in front of the American Supreme Court, others are afraid of the health system, in fact we can create our health profile with our references, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can offer good material to the next generation of fantasy writers, the Scroogled story of the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached in an alarming way.
Two minors helped the double murder of Ózd make the tracks disappear
The police interrogated two minors about the double murder of Ózd, suspected of having helped to eliminate the traces of the crime - said the spokesperson of the Police Question of the Borsod region on Tuesday.
Young people have admitted the crime to their accusation, they are currently accused of favor.
The two minors, two girls according to the information of the MTI, stand free.
The favor is punishable until 5 years of imprisonment.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old man from the scene, was put in custody on Sunday.
He's suspected of premeditated multi-micide committed for profit.
The survey showed that the young 20th-century had a large debt with a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay off the debt, so on Wednesday he lured his creditor into a ozd yard where he and his 9-year-old daughter were killed.
According to MTI information, the young man was prepared to commit the crime, a signal is the fact that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon on the scene.
The police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer for the purchase of Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the Prague Stock Exchange stock list.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer advanced by the Polish despite the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in hand in the Polish state which intends to sell around a few months more than 60% of its titles.
The Czech financial newspaper E15 states that the Polish offer represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press so far, the Vienna Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have presented an offer.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among all stakeholders the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not exclude that this could lead to the closing of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange in 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders agreement, almost 90% of the securities would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by the Banka Česká Sporijtelna with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their Tuesday's comments on the international economic crisis already speak of "a second 11 September".
The global financial disaster has happened thanks to the American president - the blame La Repubblica - who has not been able to compact his party behind a law quickly repealed, whose aim is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as said billionaire Warren Buffett, it would be more accurate to speak of a second 11 September.
A part of Madrid's press also sees the spy capro in Washington.
According to El World, the lack of American political leadership has thrown the world's economy into the cradle.
The threat of the collapse of the American financial system is growing and will then be felt by the whole world.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but as a result of the congress vote, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means of managing the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just as the history of capitalism is growing.
It is no longer possible to ignore the threat - notes the Geneva Tags-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still offer a bailout to the Barcolling Financial Institutions and with taxpayers' money can save them from failure.
But if more and more banks collapse as in a domino effect, then neither financial resources nor new solutions will be sufficient.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union must overcome their national selfishness and concentrate on the control of the financial markets left behind.
Only on Monday did the weak financial institutions get more than EUR 100 billion - he recalls the Vienna Der Standard, which seems to be increasingly real the anxieties that European taxpayers, like those in the US, will have to put their hands on their portfolio to remedy the crisis.
The EU has so far not been very concerned about the crisis that has crossed the old continent as a tsunami.
The "salvators" must not immediately dissipate the EUR 100 billion, however it would be better if they were to establish in which case the taxpayer's money should be touched to prevent further damage.
The Smart Machine Imitates the Calabron Flight
What might be the best way to develop anti-qualification technologies if you do not imitate the sensors of the obstacles found in nature?
For example, bees.
In the surprising project presented to CEATEC in Japan, the calibres gave the engineers Nissan the initial strategic concept of how to build the next generation of anti-qualification systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, the Nissan built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a robot mine providing the properties of the bees, with the ultimate aim of creating a system capable of scanning all the collisions.
Flying the bees form their own oval personal space that looks really much like our protective shield - he explained to Kazuhiro Doi, director of PR technology and research and development.
It is the role of the ape view, capable of a view of 300 degrees in each direction.
Engineers have approached the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of the monkey view.
The BR23C detects the obstacles up to two meters away within a 180 degree radius, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately transforms it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the monkey, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels of the measure necessary to avoid the incident.
This method of avoidance, unlike the current system, is carried out in an instinctive manner.
"If not, the robot car would not react quickly to avoid collisions" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the harmful and more internal layer of the protective shield, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what ape does to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in an eyebrows.
But unlike the bees, the deviation cannot go up or down or in diagonally, it can only be bidimensional and in the direction of steering.
Instead of the infinite possibilities for bees to scan other bees, the robot, as a possibility available, can wheel on itself, speed up and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by batteries with lithium polymers, lighter and with high energy density, which means that their duration is higher than those with lithium ions.
According to Andoh, the instantaneity of the intelligent reaction, not the processing of the data, or even less the ability to store it is important.
This robot must produce some inputs in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuver data, so use only a memory of a few decades of Kb.
There's no need for a gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions, which, according to Nissan, within 10 years will be able to be installed on serial vehicles.
Further application options can be represented by unification with GPS satellite navigation system that avoids road obstacles leading to destination.
They also found the name of the expensive child
The written version of the Savings Act of 700 billion dollars for the purchase of disproportionate loans has been drawn up, to be applied in several parts.
In the first step, half of the amount is spent.
In the new protracted agreements up to midnight on Saturday according to the time of the eastern coast, congress leaders decided to save 700 billion dollars after a debate that lasted for days - reported the Reuters.
We have done some serious steps ahead - said Nancy Pelosi, the democratic chairman of the House of American Representatives, according to which it was only left to put the agreement on paper.
Both candidates to the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise of the plan.
The Minister of Treasure Henry Paulson, speaking of the result of the compromise, said: the program will work and will be effective, but there is still much to be done. According to Pelosi, this is not about the saving of Wall Street but about the investment of the economic car.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets at 8 a.m. in Washington (the 2nd of the night of Monday according to the Central European hour), but it did not result in a large increase in stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the draft economic stabilisation law 2008 concerning the programme, after which it will touch the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, then gladly accepted the news of the agreement at the White House.
We are pleased with the progress made last night and very much appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilise our financial markets and defend the economy - said Tony Frato spokesperson of the White House.
However, the programme differs from the original Bush proposal, which provided that the $700 billion would all be spent on buying securities with disproportionate credit to the back.
Now as a first step you can spend up to half the sum of 700 billion dollars, 250 billion immediately after the Congress's vote Monday, with these Treasury Ministers will purchase securities with disproportionate loans to their backs, such as the remaining $100 billion will decide by the President.
A special college will monitor the programme to which the President of the Federal Reserve also participates.
The expenditure of the other half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of Congress.
Under the law, the Treasury Ministry can apply a combined tactic: it can purchase at the same time credit, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of credit "poor".
The purchase may take place through auctions and directly - they have announced the departmental authorities.
The legal rule makes it possible for interested parties to take part in an insurance programme where the Ministry of the Treasury guarantees the means of concern for which companies will pay a price appropriate to the likely damage.
Henz Paulson said: the law provides the necessary means for 700 billion dollars to arrive for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, which is about the purchase of wrong financial means, or their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will do all the necessary steps to make ourselves ready to introduce the law just signed - he added.
The managers of banks in crisis and pending state aid think that the government will limit their well-being, defined by the ultra-ocean slang simply as gold parachutes.
The limitations of payments will only take place in some cases, and the limitations depend on how the Treasury Ministry will provide assistance.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry buys within an auction, it will impose a surplus on the gold parachute, if they do not send the bank manager down to retirement.
At the time of the direct purchase of disproportionate loans, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the directors' money is not excessive.
In addition, the existing contracts of the gold parachute will not change, the limitation is only valid for the new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the American history of the entry into force of a legal limitation on the remuneration of the general administrators - said democratic Barney Frank President of the committee responsible for the financial services of the House of Representatives.
In addition, the state has the right to appropriate a share of the banks participating in the programme, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since they can also win if the economy, and together with the saved bank, will be restored.
The bill includes that in the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal that provides for the return to taxpayers of the expected losses arising from the financial sector.
Of course, there have been those of both sides who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what American citizens have asked us not to defend the taxpayer's dollar - said the Republican Member of California Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague of the Ohio Mary Kaptur believes that the measures have been taken by the same people who are responsible for the Wall Street crash.
Industrial prices continue to rise
The prices of domestic industrial sales in August 2008 increased by 0.1% compared to the previous month, by 12.9% compared to August 2007 - reports the Hungarian Central Statistics Institute.

As a result of the change in domestic price and export prices, industrial production costs were higher than 0.7% compared to the previous month and 3.2% compared to one year ago.
The prices of national industrial sales related to the previous month are only increased by 0.1%.
The prices of domestic sales in the manufacturing sector also rose to a minimum of 0.1% compared to July.
The higher prices in August 2008 occurred in the field of leather and shoe processing (2.8%), mainly bags and belts with 4.6% and shoe production with 2.5% monthly increase.
The high price level of plastic and chemical raw materials has led to a significant monthly increase (1.6%) in the chemical and product sector.
A decrease in prices occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4%), in the production of electrical tools and machines (0.9%) and to a minimum extent in wood processing (0.1%)
The prices of paper production, editorial and printing activities have not changed.
In other sectors of the processing industry, there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the supply of electricity, gas, steam and water, prices increased by 0.3% in August in industrial national sales, firstly as a result of the dominant effect of the increase in the price of gas made by the authorities since 1 July.
Compared to 12 months, considering the domestic sales of the processing industry, the increase in the processing of petroleum products (32.4%).
In the manufacturing sector of products derived from the processing of metals, the price increase was 13.2%, 11% in food, beverage and tobacco production representing a determining weight.
A decrease in prices occurred in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the electrical tools and machinery production sectors (0.3%).
In other sectors of the processing industry, the rate of price increase varies from 0.6% to 9.1%.
Overall in the manufacturing industry over the year prices rose by 10.2%.
The prices of the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector exceeded 18.7% of those of last year.
In national sales between target groups of the sectors, the increase in monthly prices occurred in August in the sectors producing investment goods (0.7%).
In the sectors producing consumer goods, prices rose by 0.3%, in the energy and subsequent use sectors, prices did not change compared to those of the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month last year, higher prices were observed in the energy and subsequent use sector (16.8%).
In the sectors producing consumer goods, the increase was 6.8%, a decrease of 1.4% was measured for investment goods.
The prices of industrial export sales calculated in flowers increased by 1.1% in August compared to the previous month, compared to the 12 months decreased by 3.9%.
The Hungarian flower around a month fell below the euro of 1.7%, compared with the dollar of 7.1%, compared with August 2007 it increased 7.5% compared to the euro and 15.9% compared to the dollar.
Next year in the U.S. unattended?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that around 12 January the US-Hungarian visa-exempt agreement could enter into force - the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
According to his opinion, "now everything depends on the fact that the extraocean is built in time the electronic system of entry and control".
However, he drew attention to the fact that the new system will no longer allow entry, but before departure the tourists will have to register.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy will continue the negotiations in Washington from now on.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will deliver the medal of the Order of the Hungarian Republic's Order with Stella and will engage with the foreign policy consultants of democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Also Barack Obama and John McCain have made a move in favor of the bank's rescue plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, guaranteed their support on Sunday at the government plan of $700 billion for bank rescue, but there are politicians claiming the resignations of the Minister of the Treasury.
The representatives of the Congress and the administration after long-lasting marathon negotiations announced on Sunday night that they had concluded a principle agreement on the bank's rescue plan.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package of the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to prove themselves more suitable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls on economic issues, Obama has regained a little advantage again, while the advantage of McCain, which was obtained after the Republican convention with the appointment as vice-president of Sarah Palin, has spread.
Obama in a speech in Detroit expressed the hope that the Congress would quickly approve the $700 billion bill.
He stressed that the proposal contained those consumer protection steps which were also supported by him.
"Now we must act responsibly (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not run away from defining the economic ideas of McCain.
McCain explained in an interview with the ABC that "all those who will send down with difficulty this situation (...) but doing nothing is not a road."
The Republican Senator said that the proposal included the creation of a monitoring committee of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the good outputs of the top managers, which he insisted on.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had no role to play in the agreements, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the bill on Monday.
Print description of the German language world
The right pole is intact, only inside the pole voters have become more aware of car - thus Der Spiegel analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
The mirror (spell.de)
Franz Walter, in the online edition of the German magazine on the left, in the article The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known polythologist, the erosion of the CSU has begun a long time before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple got in charge.
The Christians and socialists have remodernized Bavaria for decades, and right now these modern citizens withdraw from them.
The change of time is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as is Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a great surprise for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that was just ten years ago feasible: it ended the indisputable hegemony of a state-state party.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU was precipitated at 47.7%, for the first time below the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago at the Bundestag elections in 2005 still in the period mentioned by Stoiber.
This is the reason why modernization has been carried out in the region, which devours parents.
The sociologists had predicted it 40 years ago, but they had made a mistake of a long time ago. However, secularization, the results of education, the placement of the Germans of the East and the North in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of voters to the CSU.
Modernisation is a step in increasing opportunities and the political consequences are evident.
The right pole is intact, only inside the pole the voters have become more aware, critical, estranged.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks CSU has removed the classic bourgeois groups: free professionals, artisans, diplomats and graduates.
Here CSU support has dropped below 40%.
The Press (depresse.com)
The Vienna daily Conservative "Who with?" In the article "Chairmen of the parties are stuck in coalition issues" deals with the confused Austrian internal political situation created following the elections.
SPÖ intends to deal with the OVP.
The OEPS prohibits the intervention of the SPÖ in its internal affairs.
BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, and the Greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
Elections have been made, now all around the coalition; in the discussion broadcast by the public TV, party leaders have just seen the cards.
Werner Faymann President of the SPÖ confirmed that he wanted to deal with the OVP.
SPÖ wants to demonstrate that cooperation between the two parties, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann left the question open if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of the OVP, as Vice-Chairman.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was in any case rejected.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Multiterer has cautiously responded to red offerings.
As you have said, cooperation will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to intervene in the internal affairs of the OEF.
If his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition it is still an open matter in the party, questions must be discussed in any case within the OEF.
Jörg Haider leader of BZÖ has repeated to be open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to assume our responsibility to govern" - said Haider.
Járóka: The visual circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has been launched in Paris, organised by France this year with the European Union's rotating presidency.
Lívia Járóka, Member of Fidesz of the European People's Party in the message addressed to the plenary as the main rapporteur of the congress, drew attention to the school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation affecting Roma children and thus the most serious obstacle to their affirmation.
Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and European Commissioner Vladimir Špidla, responsible for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, opened the conference at the highest level.
Among those invited to the conference were the governments, the European social partners and representatives of the major European civil organisations and the defence of rights within the framework of equal opportunities.
Járóka, according to the press office of the Fidesz PE parliamentary group, recalled, in addition to discrimination in the occupations, that the Roma are being exacerbated from the labour market first because of their low education.
"Most Roma young people do not have a middle-level study title and as a result of the elementary teaching of bad quality only an unrestrained number of them can reach a higher study title".
Járóka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in the enjoyment of human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to make these links more aware in the wider area between the Roma and the non-Romas.
In fact, as soon as the school begins a rom, its opportunities to become a productive member of the labour market are increased; the taxes paid for income and consumption contribute to the nation's budget.
"The right of European citizenship of Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools" - highlighted Lívia Járóka.
According to the honourable Member, the European Union's objective and action is necessary to speed up the process of disengagement of schools and, therefore, it is essential that the existing and designed anti-discrimination directives be properly respected.
"The visible circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be cut off, and Roma children must be given the opportunities granted from the democratic area so that they can contribute as citizens full of the future of Europe" - Járóka asked.
In the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to ensure for all, the purpose of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organised each year, since the Berlin meeting last year, is to ensure a unique forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at the state and European level.
CSU: mercy for a transitional period
By the end of October, you will decide the fate of the Huber-Beckstein packed couple.
Despite the poor electoral defeat, the discussion of personal issues has not yet been forwarded to the Bavarian CSU summits.
The president of the Erwin Huber party and the regional governor Günther Beckstein still remain in place, the question is as long as mercy lasts.
Of the kind of tandem that has suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17% will decide the party's extraordinary congress in the last weekend of October.
The two very critical politicians have made it clear in any case that they are not attacked with all the forces at the seat.
They have thus tried to soften the angry inscriptions of the parliamentary group and the basis that one day after the Bavarian tsunamis, they claimed the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under the guidance of Edmund Stoiber then at the end of his career, the Christian and Social Union reached 60.7%, but now after the coup against Stoiber, 43.4% fell.
The 46-year-old CSU was "absolute monarch" in Bavaria that gives 18% of German GDP.
However, conservationists in the southern region of fundamental importance for the Hungarian economy will be forced in the future in any way to slow down.
As the first sign of reorganisation within the party, the vice-president and federal minister of the Horst Seehofer Agriculture, considered possible heir to Huber, gets a place in the restricted exploration group that will start negotiations with the FDP liberals and with the Free Voters exhibiting right values for any government coalition in Munich.
For a strange joke of the fate in the list of Liberi electors enter the legislature that Gabriele Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber was exploited as an opportunity to strike by the Huber-Beckstein couple and then treat the woman with no regard for the great ambitions.
CSU leaders now concentrate all their forces to stabilize Beckstein in some way.
In the meantime, Stoiber will also have an active role to play in the shadow. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU defined on 28 September the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday Huber issued some statements to the faithful to the CSU, according to which they would have deserved more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be able to cancel after the Bundestag elections scheduled for September 2009 if the CSU has played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory.
According to Merkel, who does not hide the disappointment for the fiasco, the loss of the CSU's land will not adversely affect the great coalition of Berlin.
What is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the injured CSU, but the social-democratic crisis still persists.
The SPD has reached its lowest score since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko-opposion: 110-0
Even a representative of the opposition entered the Belarusian Parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, it is the sign of well-being and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) that is explained by the shipyards in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people from a country of 10 million inhabitants has been without opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition, under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS), looked forward to the fact that Lukashenko, with the newly renewed presidential mandate for the fourth time following the constitutional amendment to the 2006 elections under discussion , "if only" some seat in Parliament to representatives of the opposition.
The ODS has thus given up on a previously evaluated boycott.
In the light of the opposition's expectations, Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, has requested a loan to reduce the import of Russian natural gas increasingly expensive and has agreed to give the Russians the gas in possession of Beltransgaz that cross the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter the Belarusian political situation considered anti-democracy.
It referred to a distance that the OSCE, assessing the electoral campaign, has put emphasis on positive movements and not on shortcomings, such as the ban on the submission of a third of the opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's rapid report on Monday also criticised the campaign, during which the candidates for the opposition in practice could not appear on the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present in the counting of votes.
Despite this opposition it is perceived to be an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state, considers the two countries independent for a month.
We have taken two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - it has told our newspaper Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the presidential candidate for the opposition of the 2006 elections, it is desirable that, despite the fact that "the power had been afraid to bring even one opponent into a Parliament without weight".
The opposition does not provide protests for the results, but rather tries to get voters to deliver a message of the need for economic reforms.
Of course, we have many problems, we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, for distribution the local authorities are making difficulties, but I also see that more and more people support change, even among the elders, said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that even the officially more assisted queto, that of the pensioners, considers the Lukashenko regime appropriate, which considers its main outcome to create social security.
Because of the country's debt and the rise in economic deficit, it is only a matter of time that the social security breakdown "remembers the grave silence" - Milinkevich believes.
In contrast to opposition policy, the Russian observers judged the elections democratically.
Sergej Lebedev, President of the Independent Community, told the Russian press agency RIA News: "Men believe not in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It has never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were turning doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from now on he takes this new measure against the furbets, against those who stamp, and then he's going to have a coffee at the bar in the working hours.
The new anti-fannulloni was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The rotating doors - says Brunetta - are a tool for working better, with more productivity, more presence and more services" says the Minister.
"Now there is a new season of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism," Brunetta continues.
With Palazzo Chigi it completes the installation in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of rotating doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance from employees, the Secretary-General assures us: "It was a process shared by workers and there was the collaboration of all."
I mean, nothing more breakfast in working hours; nothing more coffee and cornette.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a nice cappuccino at 7:00 in the morning is a holy hand".
During a convention at the Public Administration School
in Rome, the minister then notes that "in three months the public employees' disease agencies have reduced by 50%, namely 60 thousand people more than in one year".
And it adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more efficient
Italian, " whose wage dynamics - explained by the minister - in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above inflation rates".
In the meantime, thousands of public employees have joined in contesting the rules of the Brunetta Decree, joining the application supported by Codacons.
"While the minister of the Public Service is dropping numbers today about the least absenteeism at work due to disease - writes the consumer association - the people of 'operating fans' are growing.
In fact, thousands in Italy are employees of the right and productive public administration who have joined in declaring war to the illegal rules contained in the decree."
In particular, the Tar will challenge the exclusion of additional economic treatments for disease dependent on service; the extension of the hourly intervals of repermissibility of the sick worker, in which the inspection visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions of the Minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Creative Prevention"
Every day, in Italy, there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data confirm that white deaths were approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost double deaths compared to murders.
To draw attention to institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, today, Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for Victims of Labour Accidents, institutionalized in the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data released by Anmil and the same tragic chronics of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," said the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of Anmil, the Mutilated and Invalid National Labour Association, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "living appreciation for the constant association commitment to prevention at work, the protection of unhappiness workers, the assistance of families of victims and the awareness of public opinion".
"Of course, an angry 'suffering', sincerely shared, has been raised in the face of tragedy that, for their size, provokes the slander of the media and the involvement of the public opinion, but the daily reality responses dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
In particular, they take the numerous initiatives promoted in the school field for a more direct awareness by young people who are facing the world of work.
It is important to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to delay the alarm on its social gravity, to apply and improve legislation.
On the other hand, the President of the Gianfranco Fini has stressed "how the phenomenon of white people is an absolute social emergency, which violates the conscience of each of us and imposes a decisive commitment on all institutions to bring an end to them urgently".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not remove the number of white people still being impressive," noted the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We would not, in fact, want this "tender down" to become less attention, because it is precisely when the attention is lifted that the tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at a general level there is still too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
It is necessary, in our opinion - it has stressed Mercandelli - more checks and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this is from the school world."
"It serves as a further effort - it has added - with regard to the communication and awareness of public opinion.
But above all, there is a need for a greater sense of responsibility from employers in relation to a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of protection provided for the victims of work" and "assistance duty to which the system is pushing in recent years".
"The objective is therefore to restore the worker's insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of those who are unhappy should not depend on spontaneousism or enlargement at times prescribed by the legislator."
Mp3 readers in charge, risk hearing
Listening to high volume music for a longer period of time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent hearing injuries.
In a communication published in Brussels, the European Commission cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on emerging and recently identified health risks (Csseri) of the United States, published today.
"From this scientific opinion - it is read in the note - it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour per day holding the high-volume device risk permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable musical devices and mobile phones at high sound levels can unwittingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific findings - the responsible Ue continues - there is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
What is more, we must raise consumers' awareness and make this public domain information.
We must also review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, in order to ensure that they are fully effective and step-by-step with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable musical equipment and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise from them.
"Scientists - the Ue executive concludes - confirm that there is a reason for concern and the European Commission will now consider with the Member States and interested parties what measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and fine equipment."
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical equipment to 100 dB, but concerns about the hearing damage that may result from excessive exposure to such noise sources are growing.
It is possible to limit very much these damage by using solutions such as the reduction of levels and the duration of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee Ue points out that users of portable musical equipment if they listen to high volume music (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours per week exceed the current limits for the maximum noise permitted at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
This would cover 5-10% of the users of these devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 million and 10 million people in the U.S.
Rome, Germany gives way to the Commission for the future of capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June it will drop.
This is the calendar set out by the Campidoglio for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which was established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Terme di Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
Once the bats are closed in March, the Joint and the Municipal Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official ballline" of the Campidoglio and its mayor Gianni Germano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and there are all political, social and cultural ideas - it must stress German - it will have to provide proposals for an idea of development in Rome, of which the political decision makers, who remain the Joint and the Community Council, will then be able to use it.
There is no overposition of roles but only the desire to have a place to develop a large project for Rome.
In March, he will finish his work and then relax, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June - the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital".
To those who accuse the Commission of worthlessness, given that its opinions will not be binding, Germany repeats: "All depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If there will be quality, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
It is too often the policy to focus on the management of the newspaper and on the emergencies that are repeatedly taking place.
On the contrary, we want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future."
Furthermore, the mayor of Rome has to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a carriage zone: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to rationalize and involve the best intelligences expressed by the Capital".
For Germany, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, not closed or real, to allow our city to make a genuine leap of level, of which it absolutely needs, thinking with a unitary spirit to its future".
A future which, says the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the present municipal borders but will be kept well beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital but also "in view of the role that Rome can and must play as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? First president anti-American. That's why
He wrote a well-known American politician who has to pass us independently: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions tenthed the US economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam".
They increase attacks on Obama as the date of the elections approaches.
She wrote a lady from Miami on a website: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big toast face: he thinks he will win the highest charge of a nation he has had in all two governors and five black senators!".
In fact, they are attacks that don't say much; they are clearly attacks of racial nature and do not answer the voters' question: will it be a good president? Then there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win and with a good distance.
Even in this case, there's someone who talks to the heart but not to the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the south of the United States, wrote an editorial: once in the cabin to vote we know who will give his vote to the American patriot.
It goes out one side of the United States mindset covered up to the last.
"Tell me what you want, then we'll think about where to put the croquet, whether Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama should win, we'll leave America.
What you have never said before, which is almost certainly the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasons, the winning weapon for the democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his mandate? 89% replied: Iraq.
It changes America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home to the football field.
In Iraq there are 4,500 soldiers who have lost their lives, and the Americans have not been forced to make bail.
However, Iraq for the majority was Bush's weak point.
Whoever takes George W's place will have a huge task to do.
Use, the economic strike can also be heard on journalists: in the newspapers it is time to cut. And many people blame the Internet, the "killer" of the printed paper.
Fifty American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center on the status of their profession and mental control regarding the future.
Well, journalists today are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, the newsmen have not openly stated that they are less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for U.S. journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put the newspapers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if you do not want traditional journalism as the big public understands it, it is essentially a problem.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today the U.S. journalist.
You are on ten newspapermen and executive seniors are convinced that the journalism at the national level is following a wrong path.
In the local area, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web goes.
The biggest publishing houses open a gap to the Internet, for many views like the "killer" of the printed paper.
The "economic pressure" warned journalists increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they are hugging technology in the hope that it "makes something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap today in American journalism is among those who run the newsrooms - that is, the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives at national level are sure their reporters divide their values, while at local level the percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this has to do with "working safety".
Executives who think they're losing their job in about 3 years are 47% at national level.
For the reporters' staff if it goes 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a vast nation like Usa, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and thus become a question of "take it or leave it", take or leave it.
The directors receive almost always large wages, while the editor can also earn $10,000 a month, in addition to pension and insurance payments.
For holidays, then, the reasoning is complicated: to days after the first year, to days after the third year to arrive at 15 days in total after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, for their admission, often get sick during the year.
It's all about climate.
UNIPOL: THE ROMAN TRIBUNAL, DANILO COOPOL A GROTTAFERATE
The president of the second section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaoud, decided to reject the residence of the real estateist Danilo Coppola who had requested to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy under the Unipol-Bnl scale counter investigation.
During the process at its charge, last week, he obtained the removal from the housekeepers transformed into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estater could travel from the province to a dwelling in the capital.
According to the court, however, these movements (which he considered to be contrary to the pm) would allow them to influence their company and access to the evidence that they accused him of.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon was already manifested a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the 700 billion-dollar rescue plan lost by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
The New York Times confirms this yesterday by informing us that the ongoing crisis is breaking up the Republican Party, increasingly divided among its old East Coast soul, moderate, favourable to the federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "the Washington people" and to the world of finance, especially in the Central and South states.
The soul, for the sake of the matter, which was made prepotentially alive by the vote I was about to say at the outset.
However, this is only an example of the changes, of the major changes, which the current economic earthquake may prenounze or leave it to run: not only in the United States but throughout the West, but perhaps even here.
Both in use and in Europe the crisis seems to act as an incubator of phenomena incubation from time to time, and in the new climate they are solidified and finally at the light.
The first of these phenomena is the renewal, the extraordinary relaunch, of the dual category of state sovereignty in relation to a kind of renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which, yes, have been linked to the outside world, but which, first of all, are largely involved in the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state.
What creates an immediate political problem for those who govern it: that is how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and those families who, among other things, are also electorate.
I mean the crisis appears economically global but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems essentially out of play or not to have much to say: the European Union is giving light proof that it is usually divided between the various interests and between the various state strategies that it is unable to decide on a common policy line.
And so it is from the government of every single state that everyone expects to be involved, saving and relaunching plans, new rules, and above all the money being paid: since when it comes to the narrows are only the States that own the economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to bring things back to the sixth.
And they also have the necessary means and the right to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, in certain circumstances, of which probably no market or international organisation will ever have to do the same.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the country-state element is still in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a very closely linked factor: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of immaterial, while we were convinced that the globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we have come to a conclusion that our future will have to make accounts to an increasing extent with those very little immaterial things that are water, harvests, oil.
All things that, look a little bit, can certainly be transported from one place to another on the ground, but they are absolutely linked to a space, a territory.
As for those who are to be sovereign, he certainly has several more cards than those who are not, to those who have difficulty living in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that predicts a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and so Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the request of someone who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, economic species, has been so inadequate and full of shadow areas.
And together something even deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, an inoffensive, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire class leading in a growing number of Western countries.
It seems to be becoming increasingly roadier, in vast areas of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same ideas of the social elites so far growing, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall acceptance of the term, having made their own time and being increasingly foreign to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, i.e. it feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of delegitimation of the leading classes and traditional political essays, which occurs in the sudden "revolving" electoral or sudden events of the collective moods of these last and final times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Baviera to the collapse of the laborist consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the right in Italy has something to do).
It is felt that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say to someone, make it increasingly difficult to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not taking shape today in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is invigorating, increasing, potentially disparate.
In the face of all this, talking about a "mass revolution" on the agenda would be exaggeration.
But keeping your eyes open is certainly not for nothing.
The supercool to walk on the walls
Conquer the laws of gravity thanks to a super collar and in the future walk on the walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of various American research centres and now a team of four institutions has gone very close to us.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, the scholars were able to hold a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
THE STUDIO – American magazine Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the studio team is an evolution of those existing who use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of the neck can be imagined as a series of pipes arranged as a stack of spaghetti" explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the gecko’s legs, covered by microscopic skin that can ensure perfect animal adherence.
The tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the belts of these rectangles and at the same time "gets easily out of the wall", explains Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton University of Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a transitional adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use like the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are drivers of heat and power.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
No superhero for the moment.
THE OTHER RESEARCH – Even the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article on the magazine of the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars have introduced a microfibre adhesive form as hair that self-cleans from dust during the movement on a surface to maintain a perfect adherent.
Pharmaceuticals: never with fruit juices
Attention to the pumping juice, to the orange and apple juice.
These drinks, especially in summer, are consumed because they are desiccant and rich in vitamins, if they are taken at the same time to some life-saving medicines, alter their absorption by amplifying or reducing, as appropriate, the effectiveness with also serious health consequences.
To reiterate the risks of fruit juices are packed and fresh associated with the taking of some medicinal products David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, which since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia launches a new alarm: enough a glass of pump, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some medicines saved, eliminating the benefits and endangering the health of patients.
The pumping juice was already finished under charge because it was considered responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotics, ansiolytics, antihistamines and neurologicals up to the toxic levels.
PHARMACLES IN RISCHIO - The same Italian Medicines Agency had given this information in a two-year newsletter alerting doctors and patients not to underestimate the risk arising from this mix and to take care of what they drink in the case of taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY POMPELMO - According to experts, the orange juice and the apple juice contain substances that inhibit the drugs.
Along the list of active principles inhibited by the pump and the other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan: "These findings are reported in general immediately to the various international and national drug agencies that may provide for changes in the pharmaceutical information notes.
So always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines you are taking and if there is something that is not clear, do not impress us but ask for clarifications to your doctor or pharmacist” the expert stressed to Ansa agency.
The Nobel Prize for the Economy in Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for the Economy was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the choices in the economy and foreign policy of the Bush administration.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days of Enron's fall, Krugman predicted in an editorial published on the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that was not a bit controversial and that for years it had been remedied to the economist, but now it has been revealed to be accurate.
"I am surprised and also a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals like the Enron or Worldcom collapse has disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist", but also a publisher with a "very aggressive, particularly critical style against the excessive freedom of the Bush administration".
Open Office, here's the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft"
It is the day of OpenOffice.org 3.0 release, the open source of personal productivity suite that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the most well-known Microsoft Office.
After a work of almost a year by voluntary developers, whose backs watch SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the large audience with different innovations: the welcome screen and the revised and less broken interface, if they add other more substantial ones such as native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also paid to interoperability with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some modules such as what allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example for sending them via email, or the possibility of importing PDF files into the graphical processing module, keeping the original aspect of the page.
On this front you can always create "Hebrew PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graph of Adobe format with elements of a spreadsheet or a text processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received various improvements within applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene more handy among different users, avoiding conflicts about changes in the editor of texts, each collaborator is assigned a color in the comments for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should issue the final result.
The Italian version is available at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English version that was on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the CD installation may also be sent to the home or at the workplace.
And if the theme of free can be a train for the distribution in the houses, it is precisely in business that the Open Office suite tries the big bet, and can already count on various projects made in public administration and schools.
And there are also no lack of realities that offer an ideal training, advice and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding video writing of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the emu presentations of Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, is finally the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that we are now almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that you can also exceed the planned figure.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
New case of positivity to the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third grader and winner of the magic of the best climber.
To report the news is the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive runner in the Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Ricardo Ricò and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The analysis of Kohl's blood samples is among those carried out in the last few weeks by the laboratories in Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counteranalysis confirm the positive in Cera, Austria will lose the third place in the Tour and will meet two years of canonical qualifications.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positive in the third generation era is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who informed the Associated Press that he had notified the positive to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian sat on the final podium at the back of Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, also adding the magic to a better climber.
IMMIGRATION: NEW YORK TIMES IF YOU GO, IS IT RESISTANCE?
Italy "from the country of immigrants has only recently turned into a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with determination.
This is turning Belpaese into a nation of racists? How much is it in a long article the New York Times that devoted a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, who killed Burkina Faso last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what Nyt defines as the "north paradise": the northern regions are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" is recorded, but also the "highest anti-immigrant feeling in the country and the highest support to the North League".
Confirming the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, Nyt also mentioned the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
The new legislation of the Lega which restricts the barriers to immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestines is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
The trend is highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI at Quirinale has asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Student victims of rents up to 900 euros for one room
The rental market for university students is not in crisis.
According to Sunia's latest survey, the rent union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken very seriously the point of excluding whole sections of young people from the right to study for the highest complex costs that families of origin should support - explains the head of Sunia's study office, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand by students has so deformed the market to initiate a process of generalized increase for residents."
In most cases, the rental offers then contain a number of violations: free, unregistered contracts, without limit of cannon, connected sub-rents.
In the case of Sunia, extraordinary measures are needed which, through the revision of the tax burden, can reduce prices.
Looking at the details of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a sleeping place in the Brianza area, there are about 450 euros; for a single room, it goes from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere zone) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) to a maximum of 900 (Vittoria area).
In Florence a bed cost an average of 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the areas near the University, they spend 250/280 euros on a double bed, from 370 to 500 per single.
In Rome areas near the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) are asked about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a double bed.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros per single room) in areas close to other Universities (Ostians and Cinecity).
It saves only if you move in peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed place and 450 a single in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples there are 300/450 euros for a bed, for a room it spends from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the areas of Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari for a place of bed there are 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a higher weight in the city economy.
In the cities where rents are more frequent for extra-Community students, as in Perugia, there is at last a further abnormality: the increase of about 25/30% of the canon requested foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradise, the cities cancel the historic halls
Historical cinematographic halls close in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinematographic halls is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographes what is happening in the large Italian urban centres but also in the city of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of large multisales and the resulting death by consummation of monosales in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that seem unremitting and unconquerable to us, but also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are often historical places and loads of memory," it is as if a friend, a acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of road and many emotions," observes the director of New Paradise cinema, the film that twenty years ago in Tornator the Oscar Prize and the Grand Prize of the jury of Cannes, and that told the poetry of a provincial hall and the nostalgia for a way to live the lost cinema perhaps forever.
The figures provided by the Anec, the main association of the executives, are clear: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have been closed, and to pay the largest discount are mainly the halls in the main cities: 10 in less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost monosala cinema, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardia (41).
And to demonstrate that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new multisala cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 both in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exercise has developed irrationally" observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful that new structures are built but it would be necessary to ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its participants are willing to move to multiplex.
In order not to mention the lack of funding in favour of the executives, the state's debt is approximately EUR 10 million.
It is a shame, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not respect existing laws.
In order to support the sector, between EUR 16 million and EUR 18 million per year would be needed."
Interestingly the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, concerned about the closures, decided to run the repairs with the signature of a protocol between Commune and Anec, the first of this type in Italy, to protect and promote monosala cinemas both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
The rules include tax relief measures in favour of managers and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the restricted area of traffic and will have special rates for the stop and in some parking lots.
“It’s an initiative that I like” observed Giuseppe Tornator, and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures.
It is true, however, that in order to counter multiplex corruption, traditional halls also need to improve the quality of sound and image, because today the public is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do "New Paradise cinema", which I had been thinking of for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I go before the Rialto or Quirinale by Nationale now closed, where I have lived a lot of shared emotions, so that I don't see the dust-stained cartels around me from the other side."
Legami between politics and arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to harmonise the community's choices in the interests of the Piromelli shell."
There are heavy accusations that the magistrates of the Antimaphic Directorate of Calabria refer to the mayor and vice-indent of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for an external competition in mafias association.
In mannets too, Gioacchino Piromelli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his lawyer nephew, the boss's homonymous, already convicted for association to criminalize mafioso printing, sentenced to EUR 10 million.
"In spite of any legal and moral standard, as well as good sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay counsel to lawyer Piromelli.
"It would have been so given to the cosca - the judges write - to officially enter within the municipalities by facilitating the possibility, already large, of controlling and addressing the public administration."
The president of the Calabres regional meeting Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusions between local authorities and malavit organized there are many of them" in his region: "These are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusation is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressures of the 'andrange', heroes who keep themselves clean."
This morning's arrests followed those of July with which the police announced that they had decapitated the Piromelli shell.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved but already in 1991, and always for alleged conditions between organised crime and local administration, local politicians had been called upon to administer the Community.
Giorgio Dal Torreone, mayor of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, was elected head of a central right coalition, after the May 2006 ballet.
He screamed at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called in question the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having architectured everything for a political issue, but the judges, in the order of arrest signed this morning, explained that the Piromelli shell had even come to ask for the variation of the A3 project.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, they write the pms, "the availability to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representing a larger group knownly close to the Pyromelli, uniforming the public administration's choices in the interests of the shell".
When the energy comes from the waves now they go down in the field i big
It's a dead end, which covers more than 70% of the planet's surface and now the great world energy companies are discovering it.
Where, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they put their eyes, and now they are trying to put their hands, like the Chevron.
The possibility of generating energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, the research has intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now environmentalists and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity requirements could be covered by sea-based motor vehicles.
This quantity would be the double of that currently produced by nuclear power stations.
And there would be currents and tides.
Hang on to the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away from betting on marine energy are more and more and between these companies always voted on traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying the technologies on ocean energy - has declared the spokesman of a company associated with the U.S. oil strike to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal - and is assessing the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation concerned concerns obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
It is a signal not recently, especially if it is considered that, in Alaska, the Uses continue to extract oil and recently President Bush has launched a plan for new vibrations.
In addition to Chevron, there is the New York's Verdant Power Inc. and the New Jersey Ocean Power to travel the energy road that comes from the sea and the amounts invested so far, as not noted in the details, indicate an interest in excess, according to observers.
Technology to put on.
Experts are still talking about a technology in the trees, even because marine energy does not escape all the doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, facilities such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small and do not seem to create major problems in the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, technology must be used with a greater environmental impact.
And the choices are different: the Ocean Power, for example, uses a good system connected with each other.
The pressure of the waves, which moves the boe up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure from pistons and cylinders inside the gallbladders.
Pressure turns a turbine that feeds a generator in turn.
Electricity is dispatched to the river through submarines.
For now there are four installations of this type in the way of design, waiting for only federal approval and part of energy could serve as a military installation.
The Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a commercial centre and parking using six submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of the water when there are the seas turns the blades of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant said he has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electricity, is now worth the potential of the seas.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than the wind, the sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely about the energy of the seas that have been like New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others that look at the costs, they have already invested 7 and a half dollars in 2008 and planned investments up to 35 million for 2009.
