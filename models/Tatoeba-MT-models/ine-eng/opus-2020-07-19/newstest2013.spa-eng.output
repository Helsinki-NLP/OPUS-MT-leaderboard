A Republican Strategy to Prevent Obama's Reelection
The Republican leaders justified their policy on the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers this last as a myth and claims that electoral fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people who die because of the fall of a beam.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the rate of participation.
In this regard, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike what happens in Canada, the United States is responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
And in that same line, a majority of American governments enacted new laws that made it difficult to register or vote.
This phenomenon has been extended since the November 2010 elections, which saw an increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 Bills were introduced during 2011 that restricted the exercise of voting rights in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to a test of American citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce voting periods in advance, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of the election and withdraw the right to vote to citizens with criminal record.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state required voters to present an identity document with a photograph.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indian law in 2008.
The Republican authorities therefore rushed to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported Bills in 34 states to force voters to submit an identity document with a photograph.
It is important to note that, contrary to what is happening in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, that is, 21 million people aged from voting, do not have any identity document with a photograph issued by a government agency of their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
However, obtaining the required identity document often costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions therefore disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of those earning less than $35,000 a year, 18 per cent of the citizens over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of the voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have a photo-identity document.
And there's more.
In many states students, voters who most vote for democratic candidates, cannot use the identity document with a photograph issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states authorize members of the fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote to the Republican parties to use the documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no state required the proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to present this requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Spanish vote.
It seems that two out of three Spanish voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican legislators supported certain laws in 2011 that abolished electoral registration on the same day of election in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create an aid service for voters who would like to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, electoral registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 have resulted in the registration rate of new voters falling in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states that promoted the reduction of the voting period in advance.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, while the latter did not represent more than 13 per cent of the state voters.
In the case of the Spanish, exactly the same would happen.
These represent only 11 per cent of the voters, which is equivalent to 24 per cent of the citizens voting in advance.
However, the whites, representing 76 per cent of the electorate, represent no more than 46 per cent of the citizens voting in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the register of voters.
In this regard, democratic governors have blocked a number of bills.
The United States Ministry of Tax intervenes to suspend the most controversial laws.
In part, it was possible to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 states adopted the law requiring the presentation of an identity document with a photograph.
However, the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the party character of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that they intend to influence the 2012 results in key states.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Centre shows that the states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too soon to confirm with certainty whether these legislative amendments at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the rate of participation.
In this regard, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostatic cancer detection: Is the test done or not done?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes presents wrong results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which useless medical interventions are decided upon.
It is more than enough to make men doubt, already reticent of themselves, whether or not the detection tests should be done.
Is the test done or not?
We've asked for advice from the experts.
The studies in the United States identified a large index of infection among the sample groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between the patients who had been detected and those who did not.
The study, followed by 12 years of age, also showed that there are between 30 and 40 per cent of metastasis potentials if the detection test has not been performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has suffered from prostate cancer.
African American men have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to ensure that the patient understands the level of risk of his or her cancer. All possible options should be offered to him or her and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not care for long-term life, in which case he or she should be better chosen for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, since that cancer is not aggressive or poses a risk to their lives.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if this progress, we offer them treatment.
We have more and more frequently determined the necessary criteria to decide who should or should not be dealt with.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether the test should be done or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Urology Society, a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
We believe that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smokes, that rate would be at least 50%," stressed André Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian Society against Cancer.
On the other hand, we estimate that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Society against Cancer, the fight against smoking continues to be a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers.
It is enormously damaging to people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," spokesperson André Beaulieu said.
One hopeful data: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced to half.
Weight
Fatigue and obesity also favour the occurrence of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they add.
Feeding
It also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they scale the risks of suffering from colorectal cancer.
Craft products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat for its humid, dried or salted may cause the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently not conclusive.
According to the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, in the other, what was observed was an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
Mr Beaulieu also stressed the importance of talking about the concerns and family backgrounds of each individual with his doctor.
"Doing the detection test doesn't cause cancer."
Higgs's box in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs boson caused a great shock last summer, and rightly.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is participate of the responsible mechanism of the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is the particle whose existence predicts the standard model: our better or "less bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for the physicists, it's not entirely clear that it's Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it looks a lot like the Higgs boson foretold by the standard model.
In addition, new data disclosed this week at an important physical congress held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although there is still more data to be completely secure.
Anyway, let's assume that it's Higgs, because the chances of making mistakes seem small.
There is, in this great world, a generalized and unforgivable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to break that norm and don't try it too hard, because it will end up doing harm.
Although the physics of particles is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics in it: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantic state"; a "state" which consists, in a large way, of some of its characteristics.
The physicists classify the particles in two categories.
On the one hand, we meet with the good citizens called Fermiones, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And on the other hand, there are the boons, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means that they can be found at the same place and at the same time.
According to the website The Parter Adventure of Berkeley Laboratories, which is, by the way, extraordinary, the boons are divided into two groups: the moons, of which we will not talk here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These boones, you could underline here, they're not the exotic kisses we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extremely banal boson: the photon or the "light particle" that acts as "messager" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, "distorts" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a little like when we throw a stone at a pond.
In this "disorder" is born an electromagnetic wave (of light, infrareds, ultraviolets, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the boons "force carriers".
More stable fields
The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it's about another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" to make this boson appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it, it needs to reach extremely high energies, a little like a frozen pond in which only a thick rock could slide through the surface.
That's why it takes a huge particle accelerator like CERN (the great hadron collisioner is a 27 km circumference ring!) to achieve such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles or all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do it, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never be kept by itself stuck to the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the rest (as the photon, by the way), do not have it.
Now, what can all these investigations bring?, Mrs. Plamondon asks.
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between MS observations and predictions.
For their part, many eagerly want to meet, as the smaller difference could open a door to a "new physics" that covers certain holes in the model.
This, to say, still has enormous shortcomings, as it does not propose any explanation regarding gravity (ups!) or the dark matter, which accounts for about 80% of the matter of the Universe (other ups!).
But we have not found such differences in the CERN so far.
Effects
The impact of such investigations in our day-to-day are difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are wrong to say that there will be no one.
To see: In the early 1960s, laser pioneers in the laboratories did not at all suspect the revolution their work would cause.
They interviewed scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as the physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in the Bell laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962, at first the laser was rather considered a "laboratory apparatus".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also come from all the tools around the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a light capturer in 1969 during his research on optics.
Although it was not at all its original intention, this capturer now serves as "eye" for all the digital devices in the world, which was worth the Nobel physically in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that LHC activities necessarily want to transform our lives, but that we never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die...
In his Committee on Dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed as soon as a draft law is prepared.
However, within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
The Devoir tried to look for him.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his Monterégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was destroying her had given her a two-year breath.
"They had given me five years of life, but I have already taken seven," she relates, a walk, buried in her bed in the Beloeil palliative care centre, Victor-Gadbois, which came the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," she goes on.
The disease has caused damage to you: a huge weakness that prevents you from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on your own.
Sitting in front of an appetiteful lunch, she accepts the offer to help her eat.
Valient, he comes even to smile, to talk to the strangers who pay attention to him, bring him medicine and offer him a bath.
The bravery of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to heal my diarrhea, it's humiliating," she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for that evil.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man is making a floor," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to your childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability to accept that regression," he notes.
Because, according to the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, the great moments take place in the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care centre suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses who surround them no longer offer "curative care".
Mrs. A., 89, is the greatest fear of dying "conscious and exhausted".
But the disease has made you discover your children.
"I have some good kids," he adds.
"I no longer have any desire in this life," he says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
And wait, in the next few days, for a last visit of your son who lives in Italy.
Victor-Gadbois offers, with a group of volunteers, body care and help with food.
They are palliative care given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help her death be more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a bed of palliative care for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little, as we know we're all going to end up dying someday.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional, or spiritual comfort.
The moribundo is offered with brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetics are no longer controlled by their sugar rate.
Death is part of daily life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, his son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help both patients and their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In Victor-Gadbois center the days go by without being ever equal.
Next to a 94-year-old man who tastes his last family meeting in the courtyard, well placed among his lunches while everyone drinks his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two children, after trying to survive it all.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by persons under 45 years of age with cancer," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
A 53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent centre come from their home and 47% of the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal stage of his life, either in his home, in the hospital or in a care centre.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois Centre and the Palliative Care Society at the Grand Montréal Home, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely that great relative deficiency in Quebec's health care that makes many doctors specialized in palliative care fear the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by the eminence of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been on the move to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone has the right to quality palliative care before it is accepted to proceed with euthanasia.
"Recently," he says, "I've seen a patient spend 14 days in an emergency suffering great pain without doing what is necessary to relieve it.
I fear that patients will only want to die because they do not receive adequate care."
And at the same time, many oncologistes stop with their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Hélène Richard’s survival expectations were already low when he left an exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncologist I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me I was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting," she said.
"However, she had told me there was nothing more to do!"
No all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the sick who ask to die thank their caregivers for not responding to their demands once their pain has been relieved by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at home in Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors usually use palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until his or her death, either in a sporadic or permanent manner.
We can't pretend we don't understand that part of suffering.
More and more, unrelieved disease will have the possibility of having such palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia," but "I want to be fed."
This report has been made possible through a journalism scholarship from health research institutes in Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Travel network officials, BTP entrepreneurs, fund-raisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia count, day after day, what they know of a formidable "system", of which the construction industry is part, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafios.
A "industry" that was too expensive for Quebecan taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's interesting how the system is sprayed once we've hunted the big media," irony Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former chief of the Montreal Police.
He led the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to an in-depth investigation into the abuses of road contracts in Quebec, which the prime liberal minister, Jean Charest, at that time, had only allowed to delay.
The "Dutchneau Report" established a direct link between industry, clandestine financing of parties and corruption among officials.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the transport ministry would have saved billions of dollars in contracts," containing some of its instincts to remain with a proportional part.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already caused two mayors to fall", he adds, as he hopes to be able to "demonstrate the existing strategies behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011, also applies with its team of government stakeholders, researchers and analysts.
This unit works in addition to the police of the "Marteau Squaadra", which, since 2009, has made Montreal's "cartel of the cantarillad" move in time to inflate contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has been registering a series of allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city outside.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his mayor's seat in Laval, Quebec's third city.
It is suspected that repeated wages have been paid in exchange for public contracts.
It has formally been accused of road engineers in Montreal and Italian-born entrepreneurs, such as Tony Accurs and Lino Zambito.
The latter has been moved to explain to the committee the mechanics of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
For three years, he paid a 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a broker linked to the mafia who transferred the money to the Montréal Union, mayor Gerald Tremblay's party.
Mr. Zambito distributed money to the left and the left during the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to liberals in power.
He also admitted that he had organized a collection of illegal funds for the former Deputy Liberal Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of contracts for arable land
In Montreal, the corruption system worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, an engineer of public works, perfectly explained it to the committee: in ten years he received gifts, trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey parties and construction company subsistences for a total of $736,000, all in exchange for contracts of accumulating costs.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money to inflate bills between 30% and 40% in terms of false extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately taking a bold look at a parallel budget and filled his dirty money chests.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay left early in November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected politicians to sound the alarm.
As the mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, he has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of a municipal land acquired for $5 million and resold for 1.6 million to the promoters in full real estate boom.
70% of the money of electoral campaigns was dirty money
From the research that will finally be carried out, she ensures that she pulls "from a thread so that she can understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by herke, to stop gangrene and fish the culprits".
And it adds that the process is "painful, but positive".
We are cleaning the wounds but there would be a clean research unit in Montreal and be very careful not to repeat the questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, states that "the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of the "elected politicians in the current of the strategy."
Estimate 70 per cent of the percentage of dirty money that was used to fund electoral campaigns in Quebec, ironically, "they told me that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to $100, but that will not change the donation, according to it, "as long as electoral spending is not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
It calls for a full review of the public procurement and party financing system: "We cannot fall any lower; go to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with stronger bases, with more controls and laws."
If this story pushes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who are looking at the mirror.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would you explain that advance?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Big players have arrived.
Advancing day by day at your side.
The technical staff has also brought me a lot.
And those elements push me daily to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I don't want to.
From my beginnings in the pre-forming centre of the INF Clairefontaine to my passage through Saint-Etienne, I have always made progress on an urgent step.
It will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer's recruits are used to contest very high-level parties.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it all.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti brings me much in terms of my position.
It is supported by associates like Claude Makele, who played in the same position as I.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, no one is equal in League 1 and is among the best European trainers.
He has a great experience and has won many titles with the best clubs.
He's been working with big players.
I think there will be other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of injuries.
The confidence you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about the PSG in the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has taken our lead.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our greatest goals is the League of Champions: we have classified ourselves for the eight finals with style.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
Let's try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many and very good European teams.
We want, in order to begin, to finish the first of our league in front of the Oporto in order to be able to receive the turn of eights in the end.
Can the PSG become a large European club in the short term?
He's got the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long term.
Today, that's not the case.
At the economic level, the GSP is delivered to its resources to ensure that the project is implemented.
Not to win the drink in League 1, as in the last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we're going to invest all our efforts in bringing this championship title to us.
We haven't gotten far in the last season.
In May we were disappointed because we had the best conditions to finish the first.
We had a strong season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think it will be good.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Burdeos are fighting for the title, I think we're dealing with the weapons to take him away.
Do you think the media expect more than the PSG?
It is normal to expect a lot of us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have accepted it completely.
After we won 4-0 at home in Troyes, they still meet with things that reproach us is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what the people are waiting for.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to launch a game project.
A team is built in time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City that, after two seasons, has not managed to be classified for eight finals, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the amounts invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage per day.
That would be to ignore our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marcella, who were not well in the previous season, have seen themselves "impulsed" by this new PSG.
That proves that League 1 is passionate.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
The PSG seems totally dependent on the success of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
We'd better say we've got a Zlatendendency.
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and has many goals.
It has come to prove that it is the star of League 1.
And he's shown on all the teams he's been through that he's a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defenders, also allows us all to make progress.
How did you live the Eurocopa 2012 with the French team?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Eurocopa.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating game time.
I saw things there and I went out reinforced.
Today I win good games in the selection.
That's what I expected from my baptism with the blues.
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine, and that is why we must have exemplary behavior today.
What vision do you have of the first month of Didier Deshamps in front of the blues?
You're getting results.
They are well located in the World Classification Group.
The selector is strict, close to the players and inspires to win.
Like Laurent Blanc's case.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of classifying us for the Eurocopa.
I hope Didier Deshamps takes the selection to Brazil.
Did the empate (1-1) of 16 October in Spain serve as the basis?
That game gave us confidence.
Each one fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had not experienced a game like it in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, paying and selling without banks
All contrary to the current monetary exchange, based on central banks, the transactions identified and the processing charges between the parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technology, political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at the same time a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a safe exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files equally.
About 200,000 transactions have been recorded through 15,000 network computers.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or form of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching the top of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2,5 months later, before the 10 dollars are around again today (quotations are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
It is not surprising if we compare it with world changes in real currency or in financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on the virtual currencies published in October.
In it, the bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "which competes with the dollar or the euro" and "like conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with virtual currency types such as "credit", used to advance in a video game and that can be won by playing or can be bought (and even sometimes change).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in any exchange, a central authority controls and deals with the changes.
With the bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously depositors of accounting books, verifiers, coin issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses.
A user can choose a different direction for each payment, thus guaranteeing the anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoin changes are contained in the public account book, which is broadcast throughout the network.
The key hit is to write that new transaction in that book.
This is through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a type of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a phase of file sharing, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique numerical trace.
Computers "cogen" the new transaction and add a number before "create" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular mark (more zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good.
The transaction is then indestructiblely linked to the chain of sets of other transactions; any change would change the mark.
If, in order to make a fraud, one user would like to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would remain orphaned, as both have different tags.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided into two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to the hundred million, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in the calculation power.
The life of the network already has its highlands.
The websites that offer Bitcoin services have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in storage.
"The error used does not affect the same protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash actually has the same defect.
Weight actors like Wikipedia reject payments of this type.
Others, like the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounts and showed that about 80% of bitcoins are not circulating.
In November, the giant foxes were launched.
"The $30,000 has changed," said Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on that coin, believes quite in the potential of this technology in addition to the network of transactions.
Your system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to put into business, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
It is enough to provide you with an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who ensures that there are thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to be imposed, but there could be a change in 2013," she predicts.
On the other hand, in its report, the ECB plans to reassess the various risks, which are now considered high, if this currency is successful.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and Americans are due to leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have, above all, punished the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And to ourselves, with our 88 killed soldiers, more wounded and mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugees in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if their causes unite the jihadists, the Pakistani, the Arab, the Uzbek or the Tayikos.
Tolerable, sometimes even helped by local insurgents, they will no longer be when the Westerns become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from above the hills planted of almond trees thanks to the French credits, was ordered.
Truck and tank convoys returned to Kabul without any attack, guarded by helicopters.
There will be no flow of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since its irresistable advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country wrapped in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Its country control had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to security.
Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of their peasants overrun by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is not better today.
The old multi-ahidins, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, becoming government land for reselling them as solar to refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from the pair of huge US subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not formed by thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have learned to take advantage of the American generosity: capital escape is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated their advantages.
With about 65 per cent of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, state colleges are full of both girls and children.
Those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders will have to work.
All, including the armed opposition, are eager of mobile phones. Turkish television and its leaflets that feature a modern world have great admirers throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who wish to direct the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned about the reconstruction of provincial militias, which will flee from the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, of strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of Western nations, but the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, eliminating the position of the prime minister that has existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly on the basis of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, its country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even earlier.
No industry has re-established its services, no embalming has been fixed, and important irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing happens except fruit and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been required.
The rumor that Afghanistan had huge mining wealth expanded.
And that only increased the feeling that the Westerners were there to take possession of them.
Without energy to extract the iron or copper minerals from the ground and without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost abandoned Mes Aynak copper mines, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up the huge Buddhist location and remain there as the most important employers in the province.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country largely dependent on imports and exports, will also need to restore normal relations.
The French troops departed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girls' colleges, children's colleges, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, sanitary and agricultural fields and support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the aim of attempting to "wine the hearts and the spirits" and to carry out the impossible task of bringing aid and offensive actions together, a service of "civil and military actions" by the Ministry of Defence (Cimec), deleted in 2012, brought and made through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain locations.
These works, greedy to obtain local labor, have been able to help contain insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased crop areas.
What will we leave as a reminder after two million euros of military spending?
A more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys often located over 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests with small agricultural proposals from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
To get rid of the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have said to me that they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small, well-controlled civil aid and to bring it directly to them.
A Constitution with strengths in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which gives it temporary full powers, he has decided to play it all over.
He took everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Chief of State had given that Assembly two months more to finish his work.
And nearly two years ago, Egypt used a provisional text, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial confusion.
This new initiative has only increased fractures in the country.
For his opponents, the president persevered in his "autocrat delirium" and continued "trading his word" and "putting the right".
On the part of its partners, it is ensured that it is a measure to end the institutional and political crisis more quickly and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of regaining popular and democratic legitimacy while debate causes damage throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for him, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "or they vote my text or I hold the full powers", powers which are supposed to come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment in which 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, an Islamic majority, voted yesterday.
Most of the liberals did not go to the summons.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they believed that they could not make their views known.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, alternate members, were added to the room yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim brothers.
As we could expect, the voting articles have been unanimous.
The commentators are grateful, on the other hand, that one of the few differences in the day has been expressed practically at the time of prayer, so that a number of committee members came to think that the Constitutional clock was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted yesterday, contains 234 articles.
Article 2 of the Constitution of 1971, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia constitute the principal source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "the principles" could be replaced by "the rules", which would have allowed a more stringent application.
For Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their good will and of their respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
The liberals do it out of hypocrisy and consider it no more than a advertising craft.
According to them, Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm its compliance with Sharia laws.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "people called to pronounce are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the assumptions of a theocracy."
The fears of the liberals are further increased by the fact that the next director of the university would be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no specific religious involvement.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have been working on this text are not lecturers but university students, some of them formed in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, because the terms used imitate the religious vocabulary.
"We refer in particular to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, etc.].
And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent the civil judges are competent to pronounce themselves above all this."
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms relating to the extended powers entrusted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers will claim that they are few in comparison with those who were during the previous regime.
Another conflict: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament but to a national defence council.
Nor will civil proceedings be prohibited in military courts, as human rights associations requested.
They also showed their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberal.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only positive has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with Article 36.
The word was not contained in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was supposed to leave last night on television, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The leaders of the head of state showed up on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy land, the world's ombudsman and a sea of salmon
The promised earth combines the magnificence of Bible truths with modern comfort and a pristine nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons for visiting Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal pillar" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of Jesus' miracles: the conversion of water into wine into the wedding, walking on the water, the calming of the storm and the filled networks.
In this same place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But most of the holy places are located in Jerusalem.
The believers go here the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Dolorosa View").
Begins in the Fortaleza of Antonio, the Pretoria, where the trial was carried out, and continues along the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre in the Golgotha Mount, the place of crucifixion, the Stone of the Union and the place of burial of Jesus.
In this same place there is also the symbolic Christian ombudsman of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 C.E.
As is tradition, people from different religions leave notes here with their wishes, which will then be realized.
Perform a vertical travel
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great ordered to build in the year 25 B.C. for his family.
They are located in the mountains at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there by their own means, only those who are dedicated to climbing can get there.
The others can reach this historic summit in the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m there is the famous Hermón ski station, where in the winter months there is a great flow of tourists.
So far, from the foot of the hill, bus services are offered.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, on the top of the mountain they supposedly lived pagan gods.
Visit Unique Museums
In this country there are about 300 museums.
You can't visit them all on one trip.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It retains the ancient Manuscripts of the Dead Sea or Qumran Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the desert of Judea, and some 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition of paintings he has ties of impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha bath museum, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with models of visitors and bathers back then.
In Caesarea it is worth passing through the exclusive private museum Ralli, where the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí can be admired.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops there.
Entry is free, and donations are not accepted categorically.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
As long as you're in him and you're in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And they sing the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries where they lost their lives.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that even in the winter months are bathed in the Red Sea, as the water temperature is not lower than 21 degrees and the air is warmed up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and is bathed there throughout the year.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the lowest point of the planet: at 417 m below sea level.
Blue waters there are a salmon that easily sustains even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes around you are truly beautiful.
People come here to take treatment courses with salt water, salmon and curative crops and to strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put their broken nerves in order.
Playing Oldest Mysteries
They are preserved by the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
Through it was the famous sea route that united Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here where Noah built his ark and Persia rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to walk through the narrow streets that bear the names of the signs of the Zodiac.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of your "measuring" symbol, fortune will be a favor to you.
In Jaffa you can find newly married couples who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to take pictures.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can pass through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists remember
If he travels to Israel, he does not worry if his English leaves much to wish for: in this country about 30 per cent of the population speaks Russian.
Money for this trip is not recommended to carry it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to shequels (currently $1-3$.8 shequels).
The urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast traffic and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Low City with the High City.
In fact, it's from a underground fungal.
Traveling on any type of public transport costs 6 sequels and at this price you can travel for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, Saturdays are celebrated.
From the night of Friday to the setting of the sun on Saturday, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts their work.
But Sunday morning begins a new work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only served kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of beef and sheep meat dishes, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, the falafel, which are floured shrimp balls, fruits and vegetables.
No street dogs are seen on the streets of the Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well fed cats who "pass on to their taste" in an impressive way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of the parked cars.
The roners love the places they compete and do not reject the golosins.
The rental of a car, depending on the brand, will cost $37 (Hyundai Gettz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to insurance, it goes out for $15 a day.
And the rent of a bicycle will go out for 15 sheques a day.
The entrances to the museums cost an average of 30 sequentials.
Israel in Numbers
In 2012 Israel visited more than three million tourists around the world.
Most of those who came to the country and rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, which exceeds 51% in the same index of 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language
While MPs and human rights defenders are discussing the consequences of the law on compulsory review, they have already appeared in the afraid country that trade with "false" certificates.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Its only goal is to earn money to help your families who have stayed home.
From 1 December, a law enters into force, whereby each migrant worker must carry out an examination to verify his or her knowledge of the Russian language.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services sector, Community services institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised in the Federal Immigration Service, the examinations will be mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will not be sufficient to review the language, if not also the Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
It is the exception of the citizens of the countries where Russian is the official language.
Persons who have obtained their education and diplomas prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 shall not be subject to this law.
Utility, fatality and defence of rights
The network of review centres will be operated by the Russian-language Institute Pushkin, the University of Public Friendship, the State University of Moscow, the State University of St Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to present evidence in all cities, and more than 160 such centres are now open in Russia.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the Duma State MPs and the Federal Immigration Service.
But the rights defenders, long before the law came into force, often managed to ask this question to the press: And what will this really bring?
What changes will the mandatoryness of language knowledge, both for the Russians and for immigrants themselves?
First, the representatives of the Immigration Service respond, which will reduce the number of people suffering from "labour slavery".
Many people today talk about defending the rights of migrant workers, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of their rights must begin before their departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of cases.
Immigrants have problems without professions, education, who don't know the language or pass the medical check.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev says, the immigrant future will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, with the pretext of helping, put a "paid trip" to a spelt and narrow cave, where he and dozens of others like him consume for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received a number of complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they promise one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised wages," says the Head of the Labour Immigration Directorate of the Immigration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't get angry, boss!
However, while so many citizens of Central Asian republics who want to work in Russia recognize that they not only know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also in their own language write with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much his fault but his own misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tayikos can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to give to feed their children, because they don't talk about putting them on, kicking them and buying them what they need for school.
When they get to adolescence, these boys venture to work on the first chance.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, they recognize it.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, with regard to the law on language, rights defenders point out an important point.
The examinations shall be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no review and therefore no official work.
In the meantime, most migrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome or forbid the passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause is in the bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false registration can be made quickly and by only a thousand fifty rubles.
Russian police officers know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and there are cases of extortion.
"We are asked for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," the journalist Umed Hushkadamov commented.
"Come on, don't be silly, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was shown that not only immigrants' registration documents could be faked.
Several "false" language knowledge certificates have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The falsified documents had been printed in standard colour printers.
Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is twice as expensive as the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for a near future is to protect the system against corruption so that "diploms" cannot be bought, converge government officials and rights defenders.
To date, the authorities can promise migrant workers that they could not successfully pass the exam the first time to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian immigrants will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal arms trade
The percentage of offences committed with registered weapons is quite reduced
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law with greater rigour in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the government's reaction to recent incidents: To catch shots during weddings in which there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dmitri Vinográdov, in which to catch seven people lost their lives.
The police want to prohibit the use and possession of trauma weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons from 18 to 21 years of age.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the reforms in the arms possession law will be brought to the Duma of the State in the near future.
Not all are happy that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "hard-handed policy".
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures be taken of "unreasonable rigour".
The percentage of acts of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, Russia's BBC news service, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov, commented.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 firearms were committed during the six months of 2012 in respect of a total of 1168 recorded crimes for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are sure that a more stringent legislation in the field of weapons of civil use will not be an inconvenience for the offender to address the black market.
Now, according to his words, any weapon can be found at low prices in Moscow.
In the meantime, the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officials
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says the retired Colonel Victor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and in the Higher State.
Screenshot of the web site that accepts arms requests
The first, "arms of the army or military," that is, the weapons that were stolen during the military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were hit by the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranets.
The next type of "black weapon", stolen by criminals and security forces representatives.
Baranets explains that this includes stolen weapons from police stores and stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons come out for sale from the military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
"There are proven versions that some fires were caused prematurely to cover the lack," said one exile.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their sand granite.
"Now they have distributed private weapons factories that are not competitive on the international market and distribute weapons under the command of the black market, including that of Moscow," the expert said.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
Many guns and machine guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes crafts, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the flow of weapons," the former military explains.
Where did the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate participation of each of these sources of illicit arms supply on the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
Experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal literature and public access data from portals whose topic revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from armed forces and security forces.
Half of the weapons of the black market have arrived there "on account of officials whose work is related to the weapons", the report says.
According to researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of the cases are stolen during arms production, and 5% correspond to "illegal archaeology".
Depending on one of the arms stores, who asked for his name not to be mentioned, says that the weapons found by illegal excavators have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, it says, suppliers address military stores when they need a match.
Through some affair, the supplier buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the valley.
"This carries the gun to the city and sells it to 900 euros per unit with two chargers," we tell ourselves.
"But, of course, the police are at the heart of all matters, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan has to be implemented, they make proof purchases to illegal arms dealers," the addict adds.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and buyer are usually found through acquaintances.
"I visited web pages and blogs until a guy who suggested me to go to the platform "Begovaya", where I would be a man who would lead me to a "squint" where we could negotiate.
At the price of the gun, I'll only get there."
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the shopkeeper. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him much."
There are sellers in the markets, but there is also to come, let's say "on the part of Mr Ivanovich, who asked him to tell you that a tooth had fallen on his daughter."
I can even get a pair of steel handles through a trusted person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows I'm not going to let him down.
The new people are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military, Viktor Baranets, was tested in the role of the buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when an article was available on this topic.
Schemes, according to their words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there was no "everything".
"I felt like a luxury boutique," recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Baranets, does not offer a cat for free: everything there is can be proved.
I, as a potential client, not only buy; let's go with the seller to the forest, where we put a white.
"They give me an opportunity to shoot and when I make sure the gun shoots well, let's start negotiating," the expert describes the procedure.
Soup Store
Web search engines lead to "Vkontakte" sites and groups where we offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are required for this purpose.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the headline "Buy a gun or a machine."
There the users make their requests and ask questions.
And they sell to minors?
"No permission, of course," asked the user "Iván" (conserved spelling).
"I buy a gun TT. Moscow," he laconically raises his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures in two hands those who want to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to the liver, and then to extract coals in Siberia.
military commentator and exile Viktor Baranets
I have heard about these systems: the website is generally registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an automatic cashier.
"In response, they send you a photo and instructions to know where the weapon is hiding," reports the NGO press secretary "The Right to Arms", Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that if an online request is made, one remains unarmed and puts him in prison.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures in two hands those who want to buy firearms.
"And people go, like hungry fish to the liver, and then to extract coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend from $100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Arms", a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
A month and a half should be expected.
It is sent from military warehouses by middle-class leaders.
According to official ministerial statistics, compared to the January-October 2011 period, the total number of these crimes in Russia was reduced by 7 per cent, which is 22,900, and the number of cases identified by theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8 per cent.
The employees of fast and supermarket restaurants in the United States are being hit.
Up to a quarter of U.S. teenagers find their first job as cashiers in "McDonald's"
In recent days, in the United States, a wave of protests against the low wages paid in the supermarkets of the Walmart corporation and in restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken" have been launched.
For now no one dares to know whether or not this wave will arrive at the nine points, or whether it is intended to lose strength and get out in its first stages.
Protest actions are supported by trade unions and a series of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages received by Walmart workers and those in the fast-food system, the objective of protest organizers is to create workers' unions in these companies.
For the time being, this sector of the economy has virtually not been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after the day of Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday". That day, in the United States, the herding orgy began to catch millions of inhabitants, and was sometimes accompanied by confrontations.
That day, some Walmart corporate workers, who employ 2.2 million people in the world, abandoned their jobs and formed protests alongside trade unions and left-wing activists in corporate stores, whose products are directed to modest and moderate incomes.
Walmart sells everything, from clothes, hunting rifles and car batteries, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in their stores are averaged between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in the larger supermarkets.
That's why many poorly paid Walmart workers buy only at work.
The availability and delivery of products have made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to two critics, Walmart can afford the luxury of selling products at very low prices, partly because it pays little to its workers.
The latter also complain about the poor working conditions, such as the lack of mountings or hand scanners.
That “Black Friday” participants in the event demanded an increase in wages and complained that the cost of the health insurance provided by the corporation went from $30 to $100 a month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 an hour, this expenditure is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average salary up to $12 per hour, this will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
This is about 1.1% more than it spends on wages now.
If Walmart puts the wage increase in consumers' shoulders, each visit to the store will only cost 46 cents more.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12,39 more than they now spend.
Walmart's supporters are pleased that the protest took place only in nine states and that it did not cause any loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" was extended in its shops from the 8th of the afternoon of Thursday until midnight of the following day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, their registration boxes carried out the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview at the Huffington Post left website, that they left their job "less than five" Walmart employees and that the protest had been no more than "another trick of public relations", organized by the workers' union.
"That's free!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the goals were not exactly the major Walmart stores (which in this progressive city do not appreciate them, and therefore for now there is no one), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says that he sells thousands of millions of portions, and then they don't even give you the discount for sickness and don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the City Council of New York
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants will increase it over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one wants less than them in this city.
How it's possible to survive in New York with that money, it's something incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of the U.S. teenagers were going through McDonald's and working there, behind the indicators, in part time after school, although they were still living with their parents.
Few people saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble in some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain they have to live from this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum in the Wall Street Journal magazine, there is a comment that the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know what to feed them.
The participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 p.m. on Thursday morning at the McDonald's of the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that fast-food lodgers and cooks start paying at least $15 per hour, that is to say, double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that workers' unions be established in the fast food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits administration from preventing this right and punishing activists of the trade union movement with arguments and dismissals.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for trade unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the main is the excessive rotation of staff.
Distorts
Noisey protests took place that same day at other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The culmination of the action took place half the half in McDonald's located near Times Square, where several local politicians participated, in particular the member of the Municipal Council of the city of Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says he's selling thousands of millions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The protesters received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as the mayor Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must support the fast-food workers in order to receive fair wages and the economic prosperity that every neo-Yorkino deserves."
As described in the New York Times, this has been the biggest manifestation of this type in the American history of fast food.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, even not all of them were employed in the fast food service, in which tens of thousands of people from New York labor.
It is not yet clear if this will serve as a spark to provoke a massive movement.
"For now, cheating on the brain isn't that easy."
The topic of increased reality, so popular among modern technology lovers, is recently generally perceived mainly through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at his annual Google conference, he demonstrated a model in motion and later, in November, it was assumed that Microsoft had also submitted an application for the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group in the Microsoft Cambridge laboratory, Izadi Sharamom, it was argued that for scientists in that company, the glasses were already part of a past phase.
They are attracted to the perspective of the handling of virtual objects in the air with bare hands and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general, what is the study object of your research group?
- We are dedicated to the personal-computer interaction, but we are also trying to extend the limits of this interaction.
For now, mankind in its large mass has been trapped in the work phase with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ago and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as they are all interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has taken the interaction to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We're trying to change this, we're working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems based on different technologies, including design systems.
The world must be freed from computer science to our physical, make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, the devil with those stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course, you cannot be considered a panacea, it is up to you to resolve the issue of privacy, as you do not always want others to understand our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of computer interaction are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not in loose movements, but shorter movements.
In addition, the gestures were captured, not by the device camera, but by a pulse that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a pulse clock.
But in general, the future is for a combined type of control, e.g. gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this pot of soda?
You will speak and show it at the same time.
- Usually I'm just talking.
- Oh, that's going to be very hard to recognize.
- Or do you want to force users to adapt to what they can or cannot do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I believe that in the near future we will have to work mainly on designing new types of sensors that can accurately determine the person's reactions.
These can, for example, be laser sensors, as they provide a good depth resolution, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth, or anything else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with the three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
So we have to remember not only the resolution in X and Y axes, but also in Z.
It is also important to speed, number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay from 1 to 100 ms and it can be mentioned that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the man-machine interaction.
It would be very useful for me to work an equivalent of such a device, but that does not require contact so that the frames per second are more.
- And isn't it necessary to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three "camera", one of which is actually the infrared transmitter and the second receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or, on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible analogue of Kinect, play with the camera location curve and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- So I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, he hasn't presented his glasses to the public.
Does it not seem to you that, from the point of view of the daily use of increased technology of reality, the glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up an intelligent phone in your hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an increased "transmutable" reality when, on the basis of a cloud platform, you could go from the glasses to the smart phone,
The glasses are very personal devices, in that is your strength (the private things only you can see them), but also your weakness: an increased reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the handling of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the movie "Iron Man", but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactical response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my conferences I often say that the increased reality is the seventh breakdown in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could well be the addition of tactical sensations.
In the meantime, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as support for the image.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really oriented towards making these "images in the air". For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger gives a similar feeling to which one feels if someone was supplanting it in the fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wrists for the doll that affect the nerve endings of the fingers, this too is a promising direction.
- Has he tried to fool the brain?
To make him think he feels what he should feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here is another challenge that we will have to struggle with for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that he is going to an open, almost endless space. We are also working on the idea of racing tapes (not like gyms), mobile platforms, as well as giant globes.
For now, cheating on the brain is not so easy, you still have to work for many years.
That is what makes working with virtual reality attractive to researchers, which many things are in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens who are facing, to the avant-garde of art and culture.
In this list of the best there are brilliant figures of art and the scene of San Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the city: often they find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a barbarian man dressed in red from above, which can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or in fashion meetings and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract crowds, wherever they want to be displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely socio-philosophists of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythology.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the San Petersburg vanguardism of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is a urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city awakens in the smiling inhabitants and lifts up all the state of soul.
Recently, he took in his hands an organ and became the organist of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such a difficult role, because of his Bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going through the city dressed in red and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color because I'm a fashion designer and I'm dedicated to appearance and image.
In this world, the red color is a commitment between the artist, the creators of images and society.
Although in society, anything that is not a bit gray causes aggressiveness and agitation of good properties.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the debate.
- When did you understand that you should be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Culture Palace, where my work was shown.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old non-official artists had ended, and the new, free ones like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with those who were exposed to Gaza and Nevskiy, who led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is over.
I joined the theater for the clothes, the music of all kinds, but not for the letters.
It was important for me to meet at the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a music art club, a Bohemian club, the house of the Bohemian of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Names, Tequila Jazz, I remember how Schnur brought the project to "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonogram, wore adjusted pants, among them was the currently fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group began to play live, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was an entertainer of many programs before the times of Hali-galivski.
We told Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and assiduous customers.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, the poll took place in the press, the prize was "The People of Our City".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was elected, so my culmination ended.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separated. One can be popular but very little cult.
- There's something recognizable in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly express the present and the event.
I'm going to make a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Pajasos".
Paddles are a temporary category.
I used to be sociable, but now being like that is painful and scary.
But in the pajamas everything becomes embalmed and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, saving the world through a totalitarian and mandatory change in clothes.
Now they follow one by the clothes, pointing in the outside, but not inside the person.
And maybe that person should not even give him a hand, but spit him in the face.
And deception will be eliminated when it changes clothes.
We just saw you in the role of a city organist.
Who better than me to be!
- All right, but can commercial art best be nice?
- Now trade art must be scrupulous, sweet, touch.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before the people grouped in mandates, the Bohemians wanted one thing, the other simple ones.
Now everyone's divided into micro communities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a one-hundred-dollar ticket to like everyone.
Now we have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every hero of worship has 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov come for thousands!
- They're going to see the abandoned ones, there's the sex-social sphere.
And a cultural event goes 300 people, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything goes away.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to fool them, not to waste what you've achieved.
When I was young, I made such paintings that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually end up with paintings.
Now the concepts are often confused.
They say spiritual culture, consumption culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that's another story.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, denied money only to paint paintings.
I'm in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, what's wrong with San Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is a concept: an official of culture.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When the kings were all right in another way, the kings might not understand culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are very good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in San Petersburg who might well be experts, but they're closed, because they need experts at a higher level who properly evaluate them and open them up.
Now it's prospering the subjective personal taste.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's the matter with you, St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. There is much more culture in Moscow, there is land.
But on our stones it's hard for art to grow.
We need cultural land and now we have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
There are a lot of people in Europe who are curious about exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is infinite.
We have to make art be fashionable, as it was in the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from San Petersburg.
Light up in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or shock with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with humans on board depart in search of a replacement planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is: How to continue the species under pregnancy conditions or on the same replacement planet?
I think there's little place to choose.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says the head researcher of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions in Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in Venus orbit... in space.
The problems of playing in space with the flora began to be addressed.
Half a century ago experiments were carried out with plants.
Four generations of birds cultivated in orbit did not differ in any of the earth’s varieties.
Then came the creation of insects in the orbit, small fruit flies, drosophiles.
In 1979, codorniz eggs were sent to space to check how the embryo develops under pregnancy conditions.
We get a normal pollution as a result.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this pollution has to find support, must be kept on its own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, director of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) laboratory of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
When no support was found, the pollutants returned at random.
And after 10 hours in the newborns, a total atrophy of the instincts was given.
Pollutants did not respond to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that at the end of four days they would just die.
"And twice we got the pollutants born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the pollutants in space.
The last time a biological miniarca flew to orbit was 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion", only species of the same sex will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely in the biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies such as this must be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction has not yet been addressed directly in space.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, when they lose their usual habitat, simply cannot perform their sexual instinct.
However, unlike small animals, man can in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have traveled to space for 50 years.
Tereshkova took the highest risk.
And the most precious thing humanity has is the female organism.
Our gaviota flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it is after a flight to space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," comments the airspace veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only after a year of flight to space, the first cosmonaut woman, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was in orbit twice and even worked in the open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, the astronauts are told who after long flights have all worked out well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it's dangerous even in orbital flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, a hero of the Soviet Union, a hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, mankind must look for some new ways in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratorium of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre is a mandatory stage in the preparation for flight.
In terms of zero fleetability, cosmonauts practice their work skills in space.
Water simulates pregnancy.
If for an adult the water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newly born child is its birth element.
The small male amphibians seem to confirm that life on earth arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months within her mother in amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for her to get used to the water.
At first, this is logical, because from the time of birth to the time of the first bath, only 2 weeks pass.
"This is very little to forget something," says Marina Aksenova, a swim monitor of newborns.
In summary, if pregnancy is a more natural state for a newborn, women need pregnancy, the force of gravity.
In pregnancy, abdominal and pelvis muscles are decreased very quickly, the ability to expel the fetus is reduced.
Well, we missed that, trusting in the action of stimulants for delivery.
You can, of course, give light in a special camera, this one will push it.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asks himself this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the feeling of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscle system.
A newly born in orbit is impossible to dress with a special suit for training, as for adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we're going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead us to bring the Earth to a disabled person, to a totally inappropriate person," says Igor Pestov, head of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute for Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
In time, however, this will be a reality, when human beings on their ships turn to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space.
Chief of NKU: The inspection of the "szvarc" system has not been done with the guilty politician
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and a quality legislation, although its application is in conflict.
Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Office of Supreme Control (NKU), said in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we are missing," so describes the current situation.
The joint controls of the Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, mention Petr Neczas's attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "szvarc" system.
The prime minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother businessmen with inspectors.
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits anything, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the operation of the office that has an obligation to carry out such controls or to require obligations," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Control Committee at the Congress of Members, you spoke about the joint project between the Czech team and the German team, which compared legislation on public procurement in both countries.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control that we started taking about two years ago.
This is simplified: European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organised, and this is followed by existing legislation in each country and then by practice in itself.
We have united everything and, although control has not yet ended, we have gained very interesting differences. Generally, our country's legislation is "more stringent and more complete", however, concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate more and more stringent rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law itself.
What can actually make this project? What do you think the conclusions are?
It is precisely a common control of this kind that could help to stop us from investing in the realization of laws, reducing and improving limits, although this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of savings means achieving something appropriate at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) in order to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not by reducing the limit of the tenders, it means that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "papelle" that those who want to find fault in the system can do it more easily than if the limits were kept as high as now.
You talk about our country's problems with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKU or is it organized in another way?
In how many offices, such as the NKU, there acts the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Accounts), with an organization similar to ours, with a college as well, the only thing is that in its case is structured in a different way, but in principle both offices evolve simultaneously.
The powers are also similar to those of Germany, however, as Germany has a federal organization, the courts of accounts are even at this level, which is slightly different from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, what we call state funds here.
The public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
With regard to local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
As a general rule, I would not like to establish a comparison without specific data. However, Germany remains a model in some respects, but it cannot be specified exactly where it is best.
Could it be better, for example, as regards the quality of inspectors?
That sure not, but, I repeat, I don't like making this kind of comparisons.
It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If it weren't for that, they wouldn't have benefited from working with our office, would they?
With regard to our country's legislation, what did the amendment of the public procurement law mean for its Office? Is it any way of demonstrating its impact?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been demonstrated in the control actions.
Since we perform ex post controls, we have to count on a certain delay.
For the time being, it is observed in the process of preparing future controls: we have launched a new "non-economic risk detection" tool, whereby we have made almost 14,000 public procurements, which have been analysed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, since the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of selection process and similar are corrected.
Do you consider that the adoption of this law is beneficial or that, rather, it is a mistake for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope so.
The problem that may arise is that the legislation "is hardened" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
As with the previous legislation, controlled persons were linked to the contractor (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes of the Regional Council), and each non-compliance with public procurement law meant a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to harden the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal failure, which does not affect decision-making.
A system of this type will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We'll see where this path leads us.
The prime minister recently stated that ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Schvarc system, with reference to being autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the Schwarc system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits anything, then not even the prime minister of the government can prevent the operation of the Office that has an obligation to carry out such controls and require obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and allow it," but you can't say we're going to do it like nothing.
In the Public Procurement Act, legislation is quite strict about how formal action should be taken, and that is how it should be to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic to exclude the candidate from the best offer for not complying with formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct.
The roads have ice plates, although most of them are transmissible
In several places in the Czech Republic the roads have ice and snow plates.
Although most roads are transmissible, caution should be extended in some cases.
Karlovy Vary Region
Today morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transmissible, but they had ice and snow plates.
The temperature drops down and will oscillate between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow layer is fine.
On the other hand, in the crestes of the Metal Mountains the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places, visibility was still poor due to the cloud, according to information from the road traffic control centre of the region.
The R6 and the first category road in the region are now transmissible without restrictions.
However, it is recommended to extreme caution, especially on certain bridges whose surface may be frozen and resbaladizable.
In addition, all roads of the second and third categories, including mountain roads, are also transmissible.
However, in some of them there are still beams with ice and snow left attached.
Attention needs to be paid on the road, especially in the higher areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
In some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of ice and in higher areas and in the mountains a snow layer may have been formed on the roads, informing the Road and Road Directorate on its pages.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice plates, especially in the higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Ice can be produced in the immediate vicinity of Lanškrona, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokýh Mýta, and especially in the second and third category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been treated chemically.
There is snow especially on the roads of the Giant Mountains and Orlicé Mountains.
There is a snowy layer in the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the area of eastern Bohemia, the sky will today be between clear and partially cloudy, without precipitation.
Temperatures will generally oscillate between three low zero and a positive degree, blowing a weak wind.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are transmissible today in the morning, although caution must be lifted and it will be necessary to adapt to time.
In the first hours of the morning there will be iced, temperatures will rise between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snow and the subsequent rise of temperatures, some roads could also be covered by ice.
In some places drivers will meet clouds, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is reflected in the information provided by the Road Operations Control Centre in the region.
The D5 motorway is transmissible almost without restrictions, although it is recommended to extreme caution, especially on the road between kilometres 80 and 131.
The surface of most first category roads is dry and without ice.
In the Pilsen and Tachov road area border with Germany there may be ice-plated beams.
The second and third category lines are wet, so in this case they also warn of ice plates.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially in the less transited roads in the area of Shumava.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will meet with partially desiccated snow.
After chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of Červenohorské and on the road to Videlský kříž.
The road operators removed the snow during the night; on the Shumper road they accumulated about three centimeters of snow, according to road managers.
In the rest of the region, most roads are transmissible without restrictions.
"In the highest areas of the Schumper road, there are snowfalls.
The drivers in the port of Červenohorské will meet with a medium-desert snow towards Jeseník," a road manager from Šumper to ČTK has confirmed today.
On the ground and at night they also approached their colleagues and, after chemical treatment, the trails of the highest areas are now cleared and wet.
On the road of Olomouc the roads are transmissible without restrictions, in the road of Šternberská drivers should drive with caution on the forest tracks, where the roads remain wet.
Region of Ústí nad Labem and region of Liberec
Road operators in northern Bohemia have reported complications in different plots at first hour of the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database, the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the region of Ústí nad Labem is closed.
The temperatures are kept below zero, even in the lower areas, so the ice and snow obviously remain in the shoe. Instead, in the lower areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech central macis, there are no problems and the roads are generally dry.
No service complications have been recorded by the House.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day rain and snow is expected to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
From the general roads, unfavorable conditions have been announced on road I/13, on the border between the region of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had been arched on the road with snow weight.
Šimon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in a little less than a month, the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It's just one of so many other alarming news that we like to get caught.
The Tap Tap music group likes to joke about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to postpone or avoid the end of the world.
In addition, in December you will organize a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state-owned act that we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that has the end of the May calendar set out for 21 December at 11:10 a.m.
On the previous day, on 20 December at 21 a.m., we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end about the same time as the May calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who did this idea happen to?
At first it was my idea, then we were forging the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, along with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, together with other interpreters, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which bears the title "End of the world, cancelled".
It is currently very popular on YouTube, can you hear it at the beneficial concerts?
Of course, and it will be just the last, good, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
All interpreters will sing it at the same time at the three concerts.
The anims will be linked simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on the Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the letter of this song and plays the protagonist role of Jesus in the video clip, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together with other personalities from the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many beneficial events and concerts...
We make every effort to participate in this project.
Most of them have been shown to be interested and have fun working with us.
What will be the target of the money collected in concerts against the end of the world?
The equipment for the educational centre without barriers Studio, which we completed in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedliškov šstav.
Students of the Jedliškov school Ústav regularly receive a visit from teachers with whom they perform fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have enough economic resources to pay teachers, and we make an effort to do so.
As part of the completion of the Jedliškov štav works, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
At each concert, several groups and interpreters act.
What are the selection criteria?
We are trying to develop a programme that is attractive for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague they will act Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
For more detailed information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Do you expect any other "spectacular action" in the future?
In May we will act for the first time at the Prague Jaro festival, so here we will certainly prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
The next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and myself, personally, taking advantage of us in the United States, I would like to complete it with actions in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalists, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group formed by people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not that hard how it might look at first sight.
There are five members in the electric wheel chair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we have arranged them well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which does not stop surprise me.
Even in Moscow, where we came back a short time ago, everything came out without problems.
Thanks to the outings abroad, you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you found them with so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is much way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there remains no frequency that a person moves alone through the city centre in an electric wheel chair.
Something as common as, for example, giving preference to someone in the wheelchair in the elevator, there is not.
Fortunately, a civil association has been established that seeks to address the problems of people with disabilities.
In what areas should we take the example of more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're going behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people directly affected.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with a serious disability to move on their account in public and can go to service, to the museum, where they want to...
But it is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities participate in social life actively, in this respect, with The Tap Tap Let's go a little ahead!
A respectable or without barriers society is one thing, but when the time comes when prominent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers emerge, it will start to change everything.
So far, there are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The Tap Tap Group is currently very popular, but if we look a few years back, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator at Jedliškov šstav, where there were many young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I'm a musician, I touch, among other things, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a workmate.
And in time, as our moderator Ládźa Angelovic says, we went a little bit of the hand (Laughter).
However, the popularity has not come to these last years, or am I mistaken?
It is true that it helped us quite well to connect with famous singers and also to work actively to promote the group.
We have come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the help of the European Union, we can also allow ourselves to be taught quality, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to get that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential there was, which can be done in a different way.
The world of the show is full of things that look alike to each other.
It is logical, in its own way, that everything new is carefully accepted and it takes a long time to accept it.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, is a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and of whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well with people with disabilities, then it's not just an advance for them, it's for society as a whole.
Did he help you to be a demanding boss, as many people describe him?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be strict in many aspects and require certain discipline.
I think it's totally normal.
Some people come with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and when they realize that they have to go two days to try, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly abandons them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come in and out, you can't avoid it.
Whoever has the will and desire will always find the doors open.
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 a.m.
It will take place in the Incheba Arena of Prague, in Fléda de Brno and Plynojem in Ostrava and will take part in 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening through videoconferencing to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the world, cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to gather the resources needed to finance multifunctional equipment of the educational centre without barriers to the STUDEO in Jedlíčkov štav of Prague, whose cost is 25 million Czech crowns.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years of age have free entry into the pre-sale option at Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of European Space Agency ministers last week, Poland was accepted as a twelfth member of the ESA. It is the second member of the ESA of the former Eastern Europe bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began to work closely with ESA in 1994 and participated in the Agency's project commission over the years.
However, the way from Poland to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts had already dedicated themselves to flying to space before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I recall, for example, the conference of A. Sternfeld in the astronomical observatory of Warsaw in which, on 6 December 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneer study "Introduction to Cosmonautica".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the independent assistants and, years later, Sternfeld remembered that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Sternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch prize in France for his "Introduction to Cosmonautique".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a major promoter of astronomy and cosmonautique.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautism, was known all over the world, and his contribution to science was rewarded when his name was placed on one of the hidden faces of the moon.
Already in 1925 a train was built in Poland that was to be provided with a rocket engine.
Regrettably, the author of the proposal is unknown and the project's scope is not known.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used for the start of the dress or for its brake.
Information on this dress is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
Starting in 1933, the Polish artillery began to dedicate itself to missiles.
The research was funded by the Techniki Uzarmjenia Komorka in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustavem Mokrzyckiegim.
Based on the preserved material, it is evident that the investigation has reached the stage of the practical tests.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by the Rohoziński engineer appeared in the specialized press, and the following year the study "Rakieta - torpeda voietrzna e rakitobomba a lotnicza" was published by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for the military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczysowy Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all missile projects for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polish Towarzystvo Astronautique).
In the November 1954 issue of Problem magazine, for the first time reference is made to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronautics.
In one of them, Professor Sototwicze proposed the creation of a society dedicated to cosmonautism.
Projects of artificial satellites had already been launched at that time and it was clear that cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (PTA) has longed to be part of the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in the fall of that same year the PTA has become a full member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He performed this task until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the rocket probe RM (Meteorological Rakeita), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first launched on 10 October 1958.
The rocket had an apex of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg of weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed, and in the summer of 1959 air tests of RM-2 rockets began in two stages in the Błędów desert.
The rocket weighed 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of developing rocket would be the subject of a real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket would have an apex of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the wind of altitude.
However, work was suspended in 1962.
The successor of the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-step rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from one another through the space available to scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for the volume was 0.4 litres, in Meteor-1B 0.34 litres and in Meteor-1C 0.62 litres.
The maximum adage in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, the first of which began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km of height.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 version was subsequently built.
It is also necessary to mention Poland's entry into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national COSPAR committee two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined space space research on Soviet artificial satellites and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The suspension of the Social Labour Act is not the solution.
Last week, the constitutional judge suspended the social herbajos law.
The resolution raised a heated debate in society.
Since then it will be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic and less normative competition.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in constant conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with the unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of the large differences in labour costs (of wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and thus "probably lowers" the competitor's price with the aim of making the most of the market and thus increase its margin of profits.
To a large extent, for most entrepreneurs, it means moving production abroad, buying cheaper or disappearing there. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of work, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and, therefore, it is not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, it necessarily increases the social expenditure of the state.
This whole situation is conducive to the total dissatisfaction of entrepreneurs in paying taxes and in compensating for the economic and social damage they have caused in order to obtain benefits.
The situation is so universally known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistical data.
The low-scrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of those countries are forced to compete with the objective of artificially reducing the social level of their own population and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, Governments make private capital available to their own population without taking into account the social decline.
This is particularly evident in the changes in existing laws.
The aim is to compel the population to accept the dictatorship of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other hand, through the restricted right of employees to work rights.
The result is growing poverty along with increasing the differences between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot keep up with their own work.
The number of people receiving this kind of help is already in the millions.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly frequent case: people employed with such a low salary that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind was made public with regard to the situation of assistant employees in the German federal parliament.
The savings measures of practically all states of the EU south undoubtedly lead to the same situation.
Do you have to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, poverty goes from one country to another or never comes, as Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or Africans continue to work for an infinite part of a European wage.
This also affects all Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim to the wisdom that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, which leads to its failure to run the economy.
The private capital defends with nails and thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by introducing control.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence the political process with its selfishness and therefore throughout the state.
In this case, the answer is clear.
The test is the existence of lobbies, in the very powerful and omnipresent practice, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the area of corruption, in mutual favour, in a legislation that is practically acceptable everywhere but not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is as follows: State ministries, in the absence of financial resources, are responsible for drafting bills to private legal firms, which are often linked to industry.
This type of bill is adopted later on the Bundestag, the German Parliament.
Thus, not all power emanates from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation quickly find themselves in a situation like the one that describes Appianos in his work The crisis of the Roman republic in the times of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state took time to disintegrate and the administrations took care of the force."
In exchange for bribes, illegally obtained favors and help finance stones or swords.
The bribe and corruption spread without interference, and people turned to the urns with the prefaced vote"... "there were no people of a character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consulates"... "He began to talk seriously that the only remedy for such a grave situation was self-cracy and that it was necessary to choose a strong man"... Although Appian thought in Pompey, Caesar ascended to power and transformed democracy forever into self-cracy.
The conclusion, in the same way as in the old age, is that the present society is based on unbiased preferences of the individual benefit without taking into account the common interests.
Private capital is, in essence, unable to understand and claim the benefits of the whole society.
The result is the same as that of the then, a decline in the unprecedented elite, without an effort to reform it deeply.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes should therefore be sought in the free liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, as a defined pause, pending the next blow.
The fact is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian disasters that we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
The suspension of the Public Procurement Act is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at the international level and within the EU, the Czech Government will be forced to continue seeking other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution goes through concrete sociopolitical reforms, which strengthen both the participation of the state capital and the influence of citizens in the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the chaos lab.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could" (Nothing from violence and nothing could do that), Sting in his Fragile song and whose stribillo prays "Let's do not forget how fragile we are" (let's not forget the fragile we are).
"If my children didn't want wars, there would be no "Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in his deathbed in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, various reactions have emerged as always.
On the one hand, on the other hand, Israel argues in favour of the right to self-defence and encases Palestinians in the role of terrorists; on the other hand, it supports Palestinians and claims racism by the State of Israel, genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs and a terrorist attack on Israel.
I do not want to focus on who is responsible for the repeated killings and who is the victim. In the end, the citizens of Israel today, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not live on the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the canvas, a look to find out who benefits from the tensions that have taken place for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) on a small area of the Middle East land.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have come to on the basis of my own way of understanding the matter, about who or what group of people is the main proponent of the events of modern history.
In the history of mankind, the history of struggles by power is in the first line.
At each time we can find a Magno Alejandro or Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether these characters were always those who directed their steps autonomously or whether behind their throne there was someone who directed their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live at a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated on the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies has not been achieved in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families is one that could be considered the most prominent (if anyone is still behind, I don't know, but I don't discard it): the Rothschilds.
It's not much written near them.
Of course.
In the 1990s, they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with criminal acts of great gravity. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which always meant strengthening for them.
They have important participations in almost all the central banks of the world and in those countries where they are not represented, have been declared or are preparing for a war: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after the defeat of Gadafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia has suspended the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the bank of Rothschild Central America, began to print money during the Cecession War and was murdered in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was murdered in 1963; Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to demand the FED for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
His afan by the world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw a plan with three world wars, designed by the mason Albert Pike, decorated with the 33th degree.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchy states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial sovereignty, especially from Britain; and the third proposed to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and a billion people (like the number of slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and would not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (Ecumenism is nothing more than a preliminary project for such a solution) and the final adoption of absolute powers.
The method with which the group of the richest families, together with the Rothschilds, operates, follows the dynamics of crisis triggering and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions, however, are wrong, and always lead to a deterioration of the situation. If not, just remember that the EDF was created so that a crisis like that of 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the success of the death of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo and after that, as a result, World War I was launched, the Soviet Russia was destroyed by the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unwarrantedly from a military and economic point of view, Germany's capitulation (wars to end Zarista Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent demise of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
In order to prepare for World War II, they allowed bankers and politicians to create, undercover, a conflictous situation due to the huge war repairs imposed on Germany, creating the best conditions for the radicalization of the poor masses. Later, they were provided with the Germans with the Führer solution, which was strong enough and simple and pointed out to the culprits, and then built a Czechoslovakian nationwide with a strong German minority that should represent and represent the function of the fifth column, which took the call and provoked the outbreak of the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the foundations for the massive immigration of Jews to Palestine and started the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
It was World War II: it is hard to know whether Hitler drew too much of the rope that the international bankers had attached to him in a principle or if everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the best conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in the world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and similar to the way war repairs imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel being the focus for a third war.
If the international bankers were able to initiate it, the Jewish nation, like in the Second World War, would become a victim of the first-line battle, now with the Arab population or, generally, a Muslim of the Middle East.
Israel is a huge laboratory, a machine of welding and chaos, not only within its country, but also internationally.
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where does injustice lead to injustice in an endless spiral of violence, if at the beginning of all there was the greed of some individuals and their greed for the world power?
At this point, it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their mandates, because, as in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of fascist politicians, loyal to international bankers, who do all they can to declare war on Iran and, considering Iran as a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan) would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls Ormuz's closeness, where 20% of the world's oil passes through (the navigation corridor has only two miles wide), it would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
Under what light are the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order."
The new world order in its imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-inhabited financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new individual is implanted with a chip at birth that controls all his being.
"And compels all, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark on the right hand or on the front, not to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the numbers of its name.
It is necessary to understand this: who has two fingers in front, which adds the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is sixty-six."
Argo Film: If you get rough, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a group of Islamic students held the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
His release was to be in exchange for the corrupt shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored its regime for decades.
For the US administration, the situation offered no positive perspective: taking the shah on board could not allow it, since if it did, it would endanger the trust of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of the theocratic regime, was not within its reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later intensified further with the failed attempt to release hostages by force.
The diplomats were released 444 days after the negotiating intervention of the Algerian government.
In the U.S., its fate caused a wave of solidarity and animation against Iran.
The failure in Iran was a decisive contribution to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in front of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film "Argo" by the director and actor Ben Affleck discusses an episode of this story, which brought a small success to America.
Shortly before the embassy was occupied, six employees escaped from the building.
After a dangerously complicated situation, they ended up in the Canadian embassy residence.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, thus helping a covert story: they came out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that examined the location in the country for the rotation of a superproduction of fiction science.
Gender combination
The plan taken by the expert in "exfiltration" Toni Mendez required the collaboration of Hollywood.
To make the lie appear to be true, it was written on the cinematographic project in specialized journals, press conferences were organized, fiction production society even had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of different kinds.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movement", the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example may be the Ocean's Eleven series).
The film combines the state of mind. We find well documented sequences of Tehran. The sequence of credits shows emblematic photographs of the time of events, which were placed in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes are a bit more light, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And moreover, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: men brought to analyze the situation on the negotiating table, on the desks of the office, by telephone...
Ben Affleck has been able to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been bullied, has become a respected director and his way of acting has ceased to be the white of ironic comments.
Argo is his third long metre, after "Adios Small, Adios" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it's Affleck's first film in which action doesn't take place in the city of Boston, where it was created.
Also, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic of the directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck shows it in Argo, where Teheran is "breeding" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place on the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the embassy's taking is impressive because of its synoptic capacity that, at the same time, transmits the emotion of uncertainty and the lack of predictiveness that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect on fictional scenes (the taxing team at the Tehran Basar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that a story explained does not offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And it's pretty well fixed. Sometimes it adds something to the reality: here everything doesn't come out so elegantly (the scene in which the crisis at Tehran airport, the deviation of a call to America and the unbridled search after its track becomes a madness).
Argo's flexibility is the discontrolling of the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very graceful role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserve more space and are not, or much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses some dramatic trace, but it is a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, evaluate its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 1970s.
But if it falls, it'll be hard.
As a statement of a real story and as proof of the exaggerated notion of omnipresentity and omniscience of secret services, it is sufficient.
Rules for the inflation of balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which each year presents an inquiry into the most absurd banking rates, has now decided to announce the contest on "the most absurd regulation or ideas of the EU workshop".
"It happened to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40 per cent quota for women in senior positions in the major European companies," said Právo Patrick Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
There is, for example, a recent decision by the European Court of Justice to unify insurance policies between men and women.
So far, women have benefited from better prices in life insurance because they are objectively a lower risk.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013, Nacher reported.
Among the EU's contested regulations, for example, is the mandatory addition of biofuels to fuel which, as a result, harms the environment; another ban is the use of mercury thermometers throughout life only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the dark direction of the size of chickens, which has contributed to a significant increase in egg prices this year.
The fact-finding ban has been criticised for using the expression "uncircumcise" or the withdrawal of the classic trade bubble.
A quality plate must have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union apparatus makes such decisions often under pressure from one or other commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are usually defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, including with the threat of veto, claims the claims of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that higher-quality bananas should have a length of at least 14 centimeters in the EU and could not present "abnormal curves".
The European Commission has defended itself by saying that it is only seeking to harmonise non-homogeneous national standards so far, which have only complicated its marketing.
The rules referring to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition from some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of food.
The candidate to win the survey could be the EU requirement last year according to which it is mandatory in the inflatable worlds to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflam without the supervision of an adult.
The EU referred here to an American study that, when it comes to toys, the worlds are the main cause of child death by asphyxiation.
A similar restriction applicable to the use of mammals by children up to 14 years of age is also in force.
Interesting events are even born in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation on European officials: everyone who has any official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. To avoid harming Greece's sensitivity, we must talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, appointed in the survey, among some of the absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union's prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has determined the maximum quantities of food supplies available in the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volume established for preserved silk, which threatened it with a substantial fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in paying those countries that did not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the application of subsidies.
This kind of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
"We're in a disadvantage because we don't have the sea.
We have asked the European Union for compensation," said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued with the fact that there was a lot of grain in our country and, as a result of so-called intervention purchases, the state had full stores and had to export.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
Finally, the European Commission was prepared to assist the Czech Republic and organised a public tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development headed by Minister Pavel Nemec (US-DEU).
EU: Rare requirements are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often clear criticisms, EU regulatory efforts and, in addition, more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve our recognition, according to several experts.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but that Member States have achieved in the negotiations on budgets.
The Czechs are also affected by the sensitive fiber, as are other countries in the Union, by the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always won out of these wars.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the name of the origin of Olomouc's recursion, but had to change their name to the national rone, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and became "tuzemák".
Only products produced from sugar cane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar cane.
In the official list of EU protected designations of origin, together with the well-known feta and gorgonzol cheeses around the world, the German city of Lübeck or the hamlet of Parma, for example, are the cookies of Karlovy Vary, the Carpage of Pohorelice and Treboň and, even, the variety of Žatec hops.
As protected sails from the EU, they may be proud of Pardubice's ginger bread and Horíce v Podkrkkonoshí's barrels.
People want to save the republic, but I'm a fan, says Okamura
Mr Senator, how did you get the election to the president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything was all right in our country, then I wouldn't be presenting my candidacy.
But I can no longer bear to see how he steals in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves are being punished, taxes and retirement age are increasing.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
When I see something I don't like, I try to give you a solution to change it.
And since I am forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to introduce myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon it has been headed for the presidency.
Aren't you giving the back to those people who voted for it?
I always said that my candidacy to the presidency depended on the results of the Senate elections.
Later I specified that if I were elected senator, I would submit my candidacy to the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make reality my own ideas.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of the television, but that we tread on anyone who wants to start a change.
This is accompanied by the media, which repudiate you and confuse the freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
I'm told I've bribed journalists what I've been counseling for Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
The presidential struggle with financial thesis and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the statement of ownership of over twenty million is presented.
For that, the law must be changed.
As president, he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group so that the leadership office can be recognized as self-employed, and we have succeeded.
The problem is in politics: if anyone comes with a good proposal, whether from the right or from the left, it is rejected on purpose and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential for the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without spells or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Is a man of the right or of the left considered?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people think I'm more than left-handed.
It doesn't matter to me whether it's a little left or a little right.
What I care about is that we step forward.
I don't care if anyone's on the right or on the left, I want to join people.
Always support openly any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or the ODS and, in the same way, I will be against the bad ideas.
You're joking when it's said that you're a populist.
But aren't you proving it by what you're saying?
When a business plan is created for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you try to get closer to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals that I am talking about already work in the world or well-known experts talk about them.
But without Parliament's support, there are only signs.
And this cannot survive long-term policy.
Or do you think that if you address people and talk to them, for example, will you get a criminal and financial liability?
I don't have another choice.
Convincing politicians, journalists and civil society and trying to put them on my side to achieve it.
If the President were elected, there would be no problem in organizing a live broadcast on television, in which he would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for state politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And, eventually, they would have to communicate why they don't want it.
If there is a strong character that points to the disputes, pressure can be put on the political scene.
Let us take into account the President's direct election, which has been a achievement of public pressure.
At the same time, I say I'm just a fan, I'm not a genius or an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals, I'm trying to find allies.
I have just started in politics and tried to get as much support as possible for my programme.
I try to get things out myself, but if it doesn't work out well, within six years I'll leave it and go back to the private sector.
Sounds a little like Okamura was saving the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I'm not doing anything with a person, so I've visited a number of well-known personalities, because they're best encouraged to submit their candidacy to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Janchura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, at least I have supported the research journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the frauds with light heating oils.
I presented myself on the basis that people are really unhappy, now I'm on the balance sheet.
Sixty per cent of the population did not turn to the polls and, those who did, voted in favour of the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two of the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct choice of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I have not yet considered it because I do not have time for this, to check the untraceable past of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have money.
I have no money or for the presidency campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
Don't you have any money?
He's talking about property statements, how's yours?
I love my private property in about 60 million.
In Prague I have an estimated 25 million land, an estimated 10 million land, another set of eight million land, a collection of works of art worth ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a Super Skoda rated in a million, and on account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, was fighting evils and injustices.
Drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and you don't have any money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to borrow?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that you don't have any sponsor shows that there's not too much interest in my program.
And I don't have to pay the campaign with my pocket money.
The campaign's costs are essentially what I'm going to get in terms of senator's salary.
But I couldn't live with it. For example, I couldn't pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 crowns a month.
If I only wanted to earn money, then I wouldn't present myself as a candidate.
So you're going to continue your business so you can live?
Didn't you say you were going to quit this activity before?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I have promised, in part I have left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my replacement in spring.
People would like me to be the Samaritan to save the republic.
But I also need to live with something.
How much do you earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, I'm still winning.
If I were president, then I'd leave the business.

The MVRDV architecture study shows that true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenni library and the recently completed "mountain of books" - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it has a futuristic aspect, and finally there's something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a transeont passing the street.
And Stefan Spermon, a IT technician in a large company near the library, points out: "Also, the building is beautiful".
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have Internet, tablets and electronic books.
Nobody gets into those old fashion libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleeping city located at the gates of Rotterdam that only deserves a runaway visit, shows the dubious honor of being raised with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this shameful situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges represented in euro banknotes in the form of decorated armed concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so it was as the political leaders decided that there was only one possibility to improve statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture study MVRDV, all a master in the art of bar charts and responsible for the fun and cynic buildings, took the theme with his usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury was looking around and grasping their shoulders, Maas proceeded to grab the books by size by forming a pyramid and concluded his short speech with the following words: "Dear Conciliation:
Here you have it, my proposal for the Spijkenisse Book Mountain, called 'Boekenberg'."
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain rises in the expected place.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with a underground parking, a supermarket, a mail office and a couple of housing and living buildings.
In early November the book mountain was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also appointed to the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
Thus, the small town with no history, which so far had nothing more than to offer that a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town after whose white facade one would rather intrude a milk centre, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkennie now has the first public cultural building of its history.
The long way to the book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a queser.
It is true that there is an elevator that carries us right to the center of this mountain masso, but the true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to blend with their topography at every step of their climb up.
The fully crystalline interior is bright and easy to cover with the view, the floor of the recognized brick and the elegant lights undoubtedly support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
By raising the view you can see the park benches, the dogs and the boys and girls playing football.
And on all sides books, books and more books.
"The books are usually available along the façade and in the centre there is a huge dark room that is usually somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we've done is put your feet on the classic space configuration and take the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: there are offices in the middle, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education centre and the maintenance room.
Special mention is due to the black tanks that assume the functions of wall covering, parapet and rocking it at the same time.
The sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even architects and civil engineers more a day shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
"We would like to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager in the town of Spijkennie.
And this is how one day, in a fresh agricultural holding, we meet with the right under-product from agriculture.
For many years, a plastic fabric of few millimetres of thickness has been used in the winter and in the Netherlands as a basis for subjecting the roots of crops.
This is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine fabric lasts for two stations and then is discarded.
For the library, this tissue was taken for the first time in such quantities up to reach sheets of four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a new car mix and sports shoes.
After 105 furs reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this route, almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the café there is not only a fantastic view of the city, but it can also enjoy a delicious Dutch croquets and its ficus planted in huge machetes.
These create a pleasant atmosphere for the pair that keeps the atmosphere suitable for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a New Soul
"Although it is expensive to believe it given its large crystald surfaces, this building is a model project for ecology," Trouborst points out.
The heat and cooling required are obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge pyramid of crystal, even in the sunny days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden circles cross-sectional to the crystal facade serve to shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable internal climate.
The rest is a matter of automatic Persians.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical worker in the information technology sector, has already dared to put his foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig was there too.
Also, the Chinese traditional medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She calls the "Boekenberg" as the "late soul" of Spijkennie.
The reason is that, due to the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to give a book from their private collection.
In this way it is intended to fill, at the moment, the optical hooks of a library that still does not have its full file; currently it has 70,000 copies.
The concept has been silent.
The tanks are full.
"There is nothing worse than an empty medium library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I believe that thanks to our initiative, all inhabitants now have a certain connection with this building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the library.
Even though he's only there to adore.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved all success in this royal discipline that in the specialized argut is known as "the creation of an identity".
The town of Spijkenie has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of the young and innocent that it can be.
Finally a starting point to conform to your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more prominent role"
Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in the U.S.-Europe relations, this places Berlin in a rather dangerous diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany agreed that it would vote against the proposal to grant the observer status of the United Nations to the Palestinian territories.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites have done in Gaza.
However, due to the special relationship between the country and Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I don't think he supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being overly critical of Israel.
During the lifting in Libya in March 2011, Germany also refrained from establishing a flight ban zone.
It has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear position when important international issues are at stake?
Yeah, that's right.
This is due to the fact that it is now redirecting its foreign policy, away from a leading policy, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what is even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Thus, the Germans are in a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to doing so.
I think they're still trying what their role will be, but they've already started the way to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to that of France or Great Britain.
What exactly does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, stands ready to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds strong motivation in economic policy, i.e. in exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other major powers and Germany must therefore protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position adopted with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and in the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason it must be careful and not alienate from the Arab public opinion or from the Arab elite.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give you that much importance, since it is not a completely unilateral relationship.
However, they play a key role in the German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the United States by abstaining from voting in important decisions as in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys a huge degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a drastic breakdown as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps Germany has managed to earn a certain degree of respect.
Finally, all this has not done but to demonstrate that it is a country seriously taken as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
In contrast, the United States has clearly shown itself in favour of a veto.
Is there a disparity of views between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed because of US internal policy.
I believe that Obama's government has a great understanding of the European position in secret.
But because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot defend that position in public.
I believe that the true disparity of opinions does not really have the extent to which it is attributed to it.
If we analyze the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not enthusiastic about the policy he is developing.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile the close relations it maintains with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the attitude of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the opportunity to be part of a superior body, but they must push things from their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that Germany will play a leading role in the future in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, it is simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a dangerous topic.
But I think that the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself as an important international actor? Does Germany really want to play a leading role?
Or perhaps you still find it hard to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed, it is always somewhat uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country continues to play a more important role.
If we observe the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany is the main actor, certain anti-German feelings are eliminated.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and it is that no one wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
In view of this, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards the different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The influence of the United States in European politics is growing, but the EU does not currently cover that gap, who is left then?
Germans will have no more medicine than to assume a more prominent role.
Even if they don't like it, if it makes them uncomfortable, or if it makes them a more unpopular people, it's life!

"Protection of brands" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-famous brand and Polo Ralph Lauren too.
But what is Armani Polo?
A name officially registered in China is hidden behind this name, but it has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, this joy of protection while true eponyms do not present a demand.
And even then it's not clear that you're going to give them reason.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing Buffet, who specializes in violations of rights of protection in the Far East.
A new case arrives at my table every week.
The simulators simply add a few letters to be able to record their brands.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada it registers Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the Puma sports article manufacturer.
Pattloch opens an archiver in which he holds seats from the Beijing brand office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company asked to register the brand Zenga DF Puma, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zenga.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is a well-known thing.
In large cities there are large stores of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are of a different nature. In charge of its customers, he fights against the fact that the trade mark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying mark.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
which refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It's harmful to business, you have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The brand makes water, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage the image suffers is huge."
The financial losses and procedural costs of the affected sectors are millionaires, especially in the case of luxury emblematic products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year China is, in size, the third market in luxury goods and growing at a higher rate.
However, the cancellation of registrations of questionable legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and also entails a lot of money.
Processes can be extended for up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court dismissed a claim because it had been so long that the claim's name had already become a "market reality".
"If the applicant has bad luck, he may even have to pay money to the complainant because the process has damaged his brand in China," Pattloch points out.
Sometimes this is the forest law.
Some of the most well-known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a fight against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that had been absorbed recently by the German manufacturer of putzmeister concrete bombs.
That is why today the Chinese can continue to use a very similar emblem to the Mercedes star.
Volvo's buyer, Geely, initially used a white and blue logo that largely reminded BMW; the case was addressed in the courts and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste clothing manufacturer lost in China against copyrs from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 there have been difficulties due to the lack of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the situation of work emergency has returned to normal."
Thus, the number of untreated claims processes has been reduced by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75 per cent more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain pending.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As usual in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year, the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
It would be a new record and it would mean that China would lead the list of new registrations worldwide for a decade, as the brand office points out.
This also seems to happen with the number of valid logos, a figure of 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1,800 million yuan would have been disbursed in terms of rights.
In other words, this means that on average every registration costs 1.280 yuan or 160 euro.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as evidenced by the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting in the courts against a Chinese copycat.
Although the Germans have been able to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the facilitator has managed to ensure Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
"We have caused this situation ourselves because the names are not protected in Germany," says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO brand office also dismissed the use of the municipalities.
In the following two instances they have given Freudenberg reason, but the opposite is still fighting at present.
We need to be very careful.
The case has now reached the doors of the Supreme Court of Justice, where resolution remains pending.
Wentzler is confident that he will be able to resolve the issue and commend the professionalism of the courts.
However, it also states that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time".
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business file has had to review files of up to 100 years of age in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposite side a "sum of six figures in euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but he did not succeed.
"This shows how much we care," Wentzler says.
The dangers in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe,
specifically if copyrs are guaranteed rights on unprotected marks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
A long time ago, the group left this commercial area, but managed to prevent registration.
"We must be very careful," Wentzler says.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch recommend that German companies be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international law on brand rights, but what we need to do is "to register all that can be protected in China", as Wentzler points out.
On the contrary, the topic can be much more expensive than a simple record.
In fact, in case Freudenberg loses the last attack of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the party's right of licence for his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or the segment in question would expel us from the market.
World AIDS Day: Dancing, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, Imbongi choir and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans rejoice
The history of a link that can surpass much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First it starts with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, taco shoes and mocasines seek the compass on the parquet floor, and quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Only then will the voices of the singers begin to rise slowly (continual, low, tenor and soprano), retiring, stuttering and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get out of his castles almost by trying to arrange with his energetic and soft gestures.
It's Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg the choir Imbongi tries a new song.
Fifty singers have also arrived from 23 to 69 years of age, from the human geneticist to the householder.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a well-known foreign language: the zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to a UNAIDS estimate, the United Nations AIDS Programme has approximately 34 million people worldwide infected by the HIV virus.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40% of the population is already seropositive.
The Voices for Africa association has found patrons in Germany for the 180 AIDS orphans of the village of Esitjen.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, a child can be accommodated.
This contribution will cover the school record, the uniform and ensure a hot meal daily at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "historic narrative" or "panegirist".
In this room no one can speak fluently this buntu language, but singing does know.
For ten years this choir has been trying songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
At 8,733 kilometers of straight-line distance from Heidelberg, in the north-east of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitnie which depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent is infected
About 2,000 people live there, some of them still in simple clay and pajamas, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjen is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
The population does not see with good eyes circumcision, a practice that has been shown to reduce the risk of contamination by half.
More than 40% of the inhabitants of Swaziland are immunodeficiency virus carriers, and dying with something more than thirty years has become a habitual thing.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this returnee population, but what they saw above all were many children in the streets lacking not only the protection of their parents, but mainly food, clothing and training.
Without a school title, the opportunities in a poor country are more than scarce.
In principle, it was only the particular commitment of a few things that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal every day.
A year later, however, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since been professionally employed by AIDS orphans in Esitjen.
Committed on sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial-origin ETS are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common viral ETS are AIDS, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Ladillas and sarna are located between the ETS transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of affected people?
The syphilis and gonorrhea are more common in men who maintain sexual relations with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is part of the basis that at least four out of every five syphilis cases registered in Germany have their origin in sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are infections by chlamydia, tricomonas, the human papilloma virus, candidiasis (hongo) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20% of the new HIV infections are registered in this group.
Among young people, Chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people aged between 15 and 25.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections remains a downward trend since 2007.
In 2011, approximately 2,700 cases were reported.
This is a tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms do they indicate that this is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, urinary discomfort, flow, abdominal pain, as well as ampoules or vertebrates.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore are not detected.
How can one be protected?
Preservatives may reduce the risk of contamination, but do not offer protection to 100 per cent.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through infections by uncleanness and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if they change frequently as a sexual partner.
If early diagnosis is performed, most ETSs can be cured and it is possible to avoid any late consequences.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees charged by the choir for their actions throughout Germany are getting a lot of money.
"In total we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjen," said proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a safe woman herself and with leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany.
The orphans are taking care to find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandparents.
The "gogos", as called the older women in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in charge, offer them a roof where to live and make sure that children come to school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who do not have anyone are under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook daily for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has set up a sewing school, has built two hens and, in collaboration with the US health organization PSI, has managed to ensure that many of the inhabitants of the village have undergone a HIV test.
This is not obvious, since, despite the patent that this disease is throughout the country, it is not usually openly spoken of.
A King With 14 Wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This officially unaccepted form of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread that has experienced the HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless times that travel the country from one side to the other and that they take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "on any corner you can get free condoms, but these are only used.
It's another culture, here only accept skin contact against skin."
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years through southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost part of the African continent still remember the time of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; so much recognition not only brings you an excellent environment and a lot of joy, but has also managed to lift a couple of tears to someone other than another angry border soldier.
The journey always takes them to Esitjeni, where singers visit the children who have become embittered.
Although this small population only appears on maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is very well known.
"Assemble Esitni, there the light shines," the people of the place said.
And after traveling the 8,733 kilometers straight-line back to Heidelberg to the trial rooms of Bergheimer Street filled with singers marking the passage, one realizes that it is also possible to see its light from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice in Mercury
The Messenger survey has found evidence of ice in Mercurio.
The ice layer probably has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the North American Space Agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Although it is the closest planet to the sun, there is also frozen water, as it is revealed from three studies published on Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that a layer of ice has been formed in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow.
It seems that it has at least 30 centimeters and probably even 20 meters thick.
The water probably comes from comets or, most likely, from asteroids that in their day shocked Mercurio.
Nobody relates the finding of ice with the possibility of life on the planet, says the chief researcher of the Sensenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees centigrade.
However, findings could help clarify how water and other life components have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Completely unwary for the inhabitants of the planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that form our solar system, in addition to the planet Enano Ceres.
Like Pluto, who spins around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Telescope Spitzer shows a "family portrait" in which endless generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue points, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the stars "born newborn".
This region of star formation, called in a little romantic way by the W5 scientists, was discovered by the Telescope Spitzer in the constellation of Casiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This resolved image of an extinct star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The donut ring is composed of the material that the star spits in its extinction process.
In the huge Trifida Nebula, 5,400 light years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this picture from the Galactic Star Training Zone.
The Pléyades, a group of stars also known as "The Seven Sisters", are a visible object in the night sky.
However, the telescope can better appreciate the colors.
The Nebula of the Helica appears as a huge red eye appears in this image of infrareds.

Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great unknowns of astronomy.
It is probably the remains of one of Saturn's moons that disappeared without leaving a trail 4,500 million years ago.
One of the largest and most neat photographs taken by the Hubble telescope: the Remolino Galaxy.
Depending on the tonalities, some images of spiral galaxies become real works of art.
The image published by the Australian European Observatory shows the Trifida Nebula located several thousand light years in the Sagittarius constellation.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), as dark dust lines divide the burning heart of this star formation zone into three lobes.
At the constellation of Ofiuco the astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: at 400 million light years of Earth, the two-galaxes cores in the fusion process are balanced to one another to end irremediable shock.
This formation of stars was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations may refer to her with the nickname of the Australian Molinillo.
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebula in Cefeo constellation.
The fog at 1,400 light years is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten and one hundred times smaller than that of dust particles we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and radiographics made by different telescopes.
Shows a black hole ring located at 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served as a model moment for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the spiral galaxy larger than UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
This star formation zone constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Roset Nebula, new stars are also constantly emerging; to 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this brilliant galaxy with a small black hole, there's no dust yet, just gas.
Researchers assume that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when the universe could be found above all hydrogen.
Our universe window: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us have increasingly depth.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Large Binocular Telescope rises.
It allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inside of the Grand Telescope Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The South African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of approximately 11 meters.
The disadvantage of this most economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed rise angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Tejas also has a fixed rise angle.
Its particularity is its enormous ability to collect light.
Despite having a relatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) radio telescope, researchers can explore the universe in search of extraterrestrial life signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
In the "Extraterrestrial Intelligence Search" (SETI for its English stamps) you can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capacity.
View of the Eastern European Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here comes the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also welcome the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or Extremely Large European Telescope).
Your primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 it is not expected to take images.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes located in the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which alongside them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is an image of what it would be like.
However, the most important information of the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble space telescope.
From 24 April 1990 he sent images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, especially those that are inhabited.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been located since the beginning of its mission.
The image shows the latest preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) telescope will not be launched on board an Ariane 5 to 2018 rocket.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to seek the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers depart from the basis that there is also ice in the southern pole of Mercury.
However, there is no evidence, since the Messenger probe rotates around the planet in a much closer orbit to the north pole.
For decades radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger 2004 probe, the first one that orbits around Mercury, now scientists are sure that it is.
Drink butter daily and live 168 years
To the south of Azerbaijan, many people have reached the age of Bible truth.

To the south of Azerbaijan, many people have reached the age of Bible truth.
There is even a museum dedicated to longevity.
A search for traces in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The journey through the mountainous region of Talysh could be called wild and romantic.
The minibus moves with great strept through the sinuosa road that passes next to the forest hills, rivers of large waterfalls and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, you might even think it's in the Black Self.
However, we are located in the southernmost area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
Here the "talyshi" live, a people who don't know much, except that they perfectly dominate the Persian and the Azerbaijani and that they are very far away.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small city assumed of an architecture perhaps too massive designed in the Soviet era and that it does not seem to fit completely in a mountain landscape so picturesque.
European tourists only reach this place, as the road from Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku, is too heavy.
It takes eight hours to cross the 323 kilometers that separate both urban cores because the road is one way.
The amazing wealth that the country enjoys thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what you need to have to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva points out.
This is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one that exists in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozens of talyshis of the place that have passed the 100 years. Fatulayeva points out a picture in black and white.
This is my grandfather, who lived for 120 years.
A son of his died at the age of 136
However, the undisputed star of the museum is the shepherd of sheep Şirali Müslümov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And if we consider that the older documented man lived 122 years, it seems that the age of Müslümov is quite suspicious.
"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva tells us.
The man was married on three occasions and had 23 children. Apparently he still had time to conceive a daughter at the age of 136.
Has Şharali Müslümov been mistaken then in his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this Central Asian resident.
"In some regions of China, Japan or the valley of Hunza in Pakistan also live very old people," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; not only when there is no civil record.
Every day bottles full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik usually reach a Bible age.
Currently, there are 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do they live here, in the south, so many elderly people?
The Azerbaijani tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is the special genes of the Thalyshis.
The director of the museum, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the rich food in the calories of the talyshi, who worship meat, bread and, above all, dairy products and many of which, in addition, drink daily a bottle of melted butter, be so healthy.
Or is it perhaps the natural way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At its 97 years of age, it is relatively young for what is styled by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house in the entire Caucasian region.
Sitting on the ground, it moves inexhaustably a huge tin of butter.
Eight people live under one roof, one of them sons and one daughter of Mirzayeva, both became grandparents a long time ago.
They also play on one side to the other two little children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for guests, a tea that serves in typical bowls in a crowded form.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and are perfectly aligned and under the armpit hides two long pieces of dark blonde hair that his son discovers us proud.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so I've never fallen and kept your color.
"I've never used a shampoo," Mirzayeva says.
Pension is enough to live
He has always only eaten what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and sweets.
I've never been to buy a supermarket in my whole life.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the postwar World War II.
However, everything returned to its tail when the "loved father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds rare in the mouth of a bigger woman.
In Azerbaijan, however, the worship that is practiced in the fatherly figure of the nation, which governs its country as a dictator, does not know limits.
It remained in power until 2003, the time when the witness was handed over to his son Ilham.
At least the older people in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva cobra 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euro) in terms of monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well taking account of the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's son-in-law is right: "In our culture the older ones are very respected."
They live in a large family, they are loved, they receive all the care they need and they are happy.
As if this wasn't enough reason to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression "Human rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations that rival each other in Cairo show the tremendous division in which the country is being joined.
The future constitution, with the Sharia as the basis, is very controversial.
The Egyptian president did not hesitate in patriotism.
"We must overcome the transition.
And that is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially to the Christian Coptics, the liberals, the illustrated Muslims and the secular ones.
All of them, unremedied so far in a confusing opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile for the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, he has had to temporarily cancel the powers of the Constitutional Court and extend his "in order to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate title awarded by the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive her of her power in court?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by an assembly consisting of 100 predominantly Islamic members at a 15-hour night meeting, are of genuine concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also says that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
What, though, does "principles" mean?
This was and continues to be open to interpretation and it seems that the Islamists will take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the margin of legal manoeuvre that has appeared, to impose a stricter interpretation of the Sharia.
This is at least what suggests a new article added: in all matters relating to Sharia it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the country's most important Islamic institution with great power throughout Sunny Islamism.
It has no reason to be like this, but this may mean that the clergy would control legislation, something that - in fact - would result in the inability of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that he intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship, these courts served to exert a severe repression on the opposition.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As stated by the drafter, the State must protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its morals and values".
It is such an inaccurate formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Speaking clearly, it's nothing but censorship.
Of course, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
On the other hand, it prohibits offending or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his legions.
However, it is not clear what an offense is and how it must be punished.
Equal to doubt is the formulation that prohibits "the defence of people"
Is it enough for the president's caricature or a joke about a lawyer?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mursi for his signature and that, according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
Weeks ago the opposition was closing ranks against the superiority of the Islamists.
Ten thousand people met in unusual harmony on Friday afternoon at Tahrir del Cairo Square and swore to fail the Act before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will end up winning," says Hamdin Sabbai, who takes the third place in the lists of presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace and Ex-Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the draft of the constitution should be "in the cube of the trash of history".
Through Twitter, he accused Mursi's followers of wanting to lead a state coup against democracy.
"When you convene the referendum, we will go to your palace and overthrow it," says opponent Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been shed," he quoted in the Egyptian media as opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not want to oversee the referendum, so it would not be valid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-manifestation; if not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, before the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in the same cry: "The people demand the application of the divine law."
They demanded Mursi to "clean the country", at the same time as they proclaimed: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have caused a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Mursi's supporters did not want to risk such a thing.
The Muslim brothers said that both those who oppose the draft constitution and its supporters would have expressed their views high and clear.
Now would be the time to let the people decide on what direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the Islamist wiper has guaranteed most.
"The expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this forced constitutional process that should actually have lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were imprisoned or had to face a trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him, human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear in the new constitution," laments in a conversation with the journal "Welt am Sonntag".
The expansion of Mursi's powers to the three powers of the State led to the resignation of this lawyer.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is to abolish it," says Saeda.
However, democracy cannot work without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which notes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You are designing a monster that you cannot control."
The Norwegian rakfisk: the world's most insidious fish?
The five million people in Norway enjoy one of the largest living standards, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country's success will preserve some relationship with its greed for a very melancholy fish?
Take a series of excessively curated cheeses.
Place them in the midst of a dirty and wet football mountain.
Leave him there for a week.
You can then smell the savory aroma of the rakfisk, one of Norway's exquisites.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It's snowy. The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
The rakfisk is tricked in salmon that is allowed to ferment in water for a while, depending on the melancholy you prefer, for up to a year.
As it darkens and gets colder, the Norwegians flock to a festival held here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this most eating, so to speak, captivator.
"You eat raw and then drink a pot of water from a draw," says Havard Halvarsen, a city bomber who is also known as the "General of Rakfisk", who is responsible for organizing the festival.
On the other hand, we see people eating this fish that is kept in small cubes and drinking important quantities of the drink.
"Some people like the aquavit more than the rakfish," says Havard.
Drinking can kill the smell.
I'm trying some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near the nose, it's not bad; it's not very different from a lot of sushi that has traveled a few kilometers by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, in which poverty was absorbing Norway and in which, before there was cooling, the fish was kept during the fall in water and salt in hermetical barrels.
Later, in the winter, when it is already well fermented, it is extracted and, obviously with the inactive senses due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and mostly emigrated to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A stream of residents of Sweden, the old rival and even not far more richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
Raqfisk is considered to be an important part of Norway's past, although quite unfavourable.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A can of beer or a sandwich cost you the 10€ fridge ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of international news, and most Norwegians like that.
Here people are still not ready to pronounce the name Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the event of July 22".
The Norwegians find it most costly to believe that in their peaceful country one of theirs would be able to commit such cruelty and murder.
After much of Norway's current wealth, there is growth, from the beginning of the 70s, of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason why we're doing so well," says Anna, our comrade, as she goes through rakfisk flags and that, with her long red melon and her amazing blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian welfare.
"We are, as you said, prudent people."
Your English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like alarming, we don't like ostentation."
Norway has managed its oil wealth very carefully; everything, except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for future generations.
While the whole world was wasting money that it did not have during the years that preceded the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the ticket well closed.
"As we can ski in winter and make hiking in summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a heart attack.
I'm in the snow doing cocoon to eat something; I've already had enough rakfisk.
Now a high hamburger is undoubtedly something different and quite succulent to taste.
But at night, he's turning that nasty fish.
The hotel in which I stay is one of the many places where a Rakfisk dinner is held in which the commanders vote the best fish, or perhaps the one that puts the nose pits to the test.
A TV has connected live to a pajarita presenter and is surrounded by Rakfisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovision competition.
"What are your scores for the best fishing up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There are laughter and applause.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps overcome by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the steams of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a hard start
While the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, is preparing to take over his office, the correspondent of the BBC, Will Grant, analyzes the challenges facing the new President and the different expectations of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at present.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already congested by itself, has been set up since Monday a steel circle that cuts several of the main roads leading to the city and is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The objective, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their place of work, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and assume the nation's management.
Faced with a complicated task.
Mexico has been gaining good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is submerged in a war against drug trafficking that has been charged for some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment with the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, at the Oval Office.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal."
Before he co-ordinated with the president of the United States, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as governor of his native state, the one in Mexico.
A very populous and fast-growing state that surrounds the capital; the views on the new leader are divided into this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, you are reminded with affection.
Its residents attribute to it the merit of the growth of tourism in the site and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city you can drive through one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new roads, which is a huge improvement compared to the rough roads and lots of bays that have been rehabilitated.
You can also see plates with their name at the entrance of a modern polysport and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We trust that he can make a real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a member of the Party of Mr Peña Nieto, PRI.
"Partly, as regards security and economy, we expect the interesting and real change our country needs so much."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was released by Vicente Fox in 2000.
MEP Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the qualification that opposition lacks the essence of the new president.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a fantastic man of state and, above all, he's a person who can hear."
However, on the other hand, that state is not the impression that many people have about its former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as the City of Neza, the contrast to the well-adjusted streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under high highway tracks is, in many respects, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
At the beginning of this year, military intervention was requested to assist in the fight against drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods and violence against women was particularly serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been abandoned in only the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than that of the city of Juárez, unfortunately famous for his violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Mr. Peña Nieto's critics say, in the best of cases, that I did not know how to deal with the problem of feminism while in charge.
The most critics accuse their administration of making a fat look.
In a concrete house, typical of the degraded neighborhood, Irinea Buendia has to make efforts to contain tears while showing me pictures of her dead daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner murdered her.
"When I came to her house, it seemed as if they had cleaned her body," recalls Mrs. Buendía.
"There were signs that he had been beaten and the strict mortis had already appeared."
While his mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana looks from the walls, along with a cross where a single word is read: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says she has been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me as if it were an old chismus, an abbot, a queer.
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and shuts up."
"But that can't be so when there have been so many irregularities and so much neglect," he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term of office.
"I hope it's the same kind of president he was when he was governor," says PRI Olvera's MP in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of Neza City are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning did not report bad treatment, according to the prosecutors
The prosecutors are trying to deal with Bradley Manning's abuse allegations during their prison stay.
The trial focuses on the Manning period in Quantico's military prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis that Manning's imprisonment was severe
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to prove Friday that soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the highest filtration of confidential information in the history of the United States, lost many opportunities to denounce the ill-treatment he now claims he suffered while under military arrest.
During the investigation that the prosecutor conducted in Manning in a pre-trial view in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein said that the records of the weekly visits of officers of the unit that Manning received for nine months in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which took place during a vision taken on the basis of the defence's request that the case be dismissed, given that his imprisonment had been severe and that it had already suffered enough punishment, arrived one day after Manning had testified that he had thought of suicide while he was in custody.
The military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
In view of Friday, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled after visits to Manning during their arrest in Quantico military prison, where he was imprisoned in a maximum prison regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers would have asked Manning questions and noted their answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had qualified the treatment given to him by the celeators as "excellent" and the treatment received in the facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms show no complaints of ill-treatment, although officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers who had visited him had talked about those issues and had indicated that they would be dealt with, but that they had not left a record of those issues.
"They wrote 'no incidence' (after having talked about the problems) but this doesn't necessarily mean that I wouldn't have mentioned any problems," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel of the Denise Lind Army, also asked Manning why he had not complained about the treatment he had received during the January 2011 meeting with a counsel to examine the suicide intentions he had expressed in a form a month earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the "prevention of injuries" regime under which he was under.
The military said that it had been placed under that restrictive regime, which was a degree below that of surveillance for possible suicide, in order to ensure its protection and security for others.
"I wanted the biggest state to know that I was good and (I wanted) to stop being under injury prevention... to be able to enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison based in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he lost his knowledge because of the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced only to the Arajon camp, to that cage," Manning explained on Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning said that after moving to Quantico, he spent most of the days in a small cell for at least 21 hours and often for 23 hours without company.
Manning said that he was only allowed to have a spoon, a blanket, a scarf, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, since he was forbidden to sleep or even to fall asleep during the day.
Manning said he always had a light coming out pointing to his eyes while he was sleeping.
He said that if the cellars couldn't see his face when he was back at night, they woke him up so he could come back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint on Manning's treatment.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about a complaint he had made in the statement on Thursday, according to which, after being forced to sleep naked in his Quantico cell, he was forced to remain naked in front of the cells and other prisoners during a morning account.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the account.
During the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said he withdrew from the order given to him by the cellist who should have let the blanket fall with which he could have covered, but admitted that no one had ordered him to let it fall.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning said he had told the officer that he might have used the elasticity of his inner clothes or his self-esteeming legs but that he had not.
Manning testified that that night they had removed from their cell their inner clothes, their cheeks and their glasses.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account the experiences he had experienced during his stay in prison and dramatically reduced his sentence in case he was convicted in the war council, which is expected to begin at the beginning of the coming year.
The defence stated that it intended to make Manning guilty of minor crimes and to defend other accusations considered too extreme.
The view is scheduled to be resumed this weekend and the prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has argued that Manning was detained in accordance with the rules of application to any detainee under maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, illegally triggering the publication of information on the Internet, filtration of national defence information and theft of property or public records.
If he is found guilty of all charges, he could face a permanent chain.
My Mexican-US identity crisis
He claims that many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who went; they say they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that the Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had only fallen by the exploding and reached the immigration treatment area and was already completely confused.
Some signposts indicated the way to two hills: one for "Mexicoans" and the other for "Exteriors".
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where I should go.
When I grew up in Central California, my whole life was called "Mexicoan."
It's about ethnic tachygraphy, just as my Boston friends refer to themselves as "Irish" or my New York friends as "Italian" themselves.
Later I decided to "Mexico-US".
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather's homeland, the tachygraphy or script was not necessary.
He was simply American.
I speak Spanish as well as to handle me during an interview in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary level of a native and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and put myself in the foreign queue.
I thought at that time this week when the elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda, as with the leaders of these two countries, it was stated: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also wishing to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why it is now so likely that a Mexican stays in Mexico as he ventures to go to the United States.
He wants to associate with the United States and Canada and create a trade block in the European Union style in North America.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to surrender half of their territory to the point of gun.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements they remember are everywhere.
So, at the moment when a U.S. official says anything that brings the slightest criticism to Mexico, you start to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how the Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the children of Moctzuma are set up in war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a whole challenge is that of more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about resentment?
There's a lot.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it is not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our genealogical tree, there was a person, maybe the father or mother or one of the grandparents, to whom the door of opportunities was closed in Mexico and had to go north.
And most of the time that person fit into a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of study, from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants and are loyal.
Mexico doesn't.
And although we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight of what we are living in is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican.
Our identity may not be clear at times, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexicans who belong to the elite of the ruling class do not like them.
The feeling is mutual.
It sees us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and looks over our shoulder as if we were from a lower category that is not enough Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And now we wouldn't find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States, but still, like lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a girl, reminds me that this rock exists between the Mexicans and the American-Americans because the first ones know more solidly who they are and the second ones are upset.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of the two countries.
In the meantime, many Mexican-Americans I know feel that they are not part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best in each country, but you're not drawn to any of them.
In Mexico you see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to make things even more complicated, so I have understood during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to connect to the diaspora again.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised ambassadors of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our American colleagues how fantastic it is to visit that country and press the political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course...
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much resentment.
And, with wage inequality, galloping corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're gonna be alone with this idea, guys.
You're right.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-US Americans are still reciprocated by how their families were treated a lot less time ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old battles, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be a unlikely basis for peace
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood flow that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of the useless and usual discussions about whom it started first, lots of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed, and for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to be anchored in their old conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything to taste or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional alborote.
Maybe this will make your fight even more bloody than before.
There are, however, reasons to believe that their fatal death situation could break down.
A War That Neither Loses nor Wins
At first sight, optimism seems currently very difficult to justify.
Even if the fire agreed on 21 November is maintained, this week's clashes have strengthened the halcons of both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has received a good strike.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting pressure on the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populous ruins on the planet, Israel has not been able to end Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently governed by its implodable rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could conclude that time plays for them.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a renaissance regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. Qatar has also done so, one of the wealthiest and most dynamic states of the Gulf.
The successful Hamas members say that the middle Islamic month is around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbula military party dominates, passing through Syria, where the rebels of an increasingly Islamic trend could overthrow Bashar Assad, until they reach Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Above all in southern Israel, the growth of Muslim brothers led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, unlike the most populous and fundamental of Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the lay despot who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time for Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim brothers are the first brothers of Hamas and their leaders depend more on the popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as a protagonist to which even Israel and the United States cannot be excluded.
In the meantime, the hard wing of Israel will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, they have put Hamas in place.
The Israeli Couple Iron Anti-Misil System has proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep more quietly... for a while.
As for diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the last wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered, especially under the rule of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have ended up with the lives of some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide terrorists, in part thanks to the barrier that is being waged by the West Bank, the main piece of an aspiracy territory to become a state of Palestine, and it protects Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite the fact that international legislation makes them illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Lakud party has joined an even harder line led by Avigdor Lieberman in the pre-election period on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why am I smacking those Palestinian rectors by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn't they shoot rockets like they did their compatriots in Gaza?
It's better to keep them behind that wall and give them a good shot if they raise their head.
Perhaps the harsh wing is imposed, although the Arab spring could change its calculations.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere lack appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defence budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
Initiating a war with the superpower of the area will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the fire out is a good wish and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think in the long term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination is supposed to create a dust that will one day operate in the territories occupied by Israel, in the same way that a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already threatening democracy in the Jewish state and demographics are worsening the situation as the Arab population increases.
The gruesome missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an increasing diplomatic fee.
Both gangs need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains to be the prayer of people who are sensitive to both gangs, the majority of the outside world and this journal: two states and Israel's territorial assignment for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire gives a little more impetus to the foreign people who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to put a stop to the entry of weapons into Gaza, together with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the borders of 1967, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Foreign Arabs should also press Hamas and Fatah to join.
This would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual status category in the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also had an important role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term of office, he ignored his own plan for peace.
Again in the White House, it seems as reticent to devote your attention to it.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
General Tobacco Package Act enters into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases light on boxes of a green extinguished, which are the same for all tobacco brands
Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, pioneer in the world, enters into force and replaces the logos and colors of the brands by a wrapper of a green olive evaporate, a terrible image of parts of the body with diseases and representations of children and babies ill because of being children of smoking parents.
Except for the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a kind of small source.
This is the strictest regime in the world applied to the pack of tobacco.
The federal government of Australia states that the goal is to deter young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit glamour.
Trusts in studies that demonstrate that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there are 99 per cent of the possibilities that he will never do so.
"It can be seen that children, even from a very early age, understand the message the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies that showed, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown with the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest rates of smokers in the world and these changes will not have much impact on the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has put a huge pressure on the law.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would promote the black tobacco market, in which cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will lead to serious involuntary consequences," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that will be brought by the falsifiers from China and Indonesia to sell it on the streets of Australia.
Others say that their business has benefited since the adoption of the law.
Sandra Ha, from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for silicone pills and covers to cover the unpleasant images of the boxes had been fired almost two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a refusal to the law in the Supreme Court of Australia.
Ms. Ha said that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesalers and was expecting more stocks.
"For us it's a good deal."
According to experts, the potential obstacle is the popularity of social networks between the demographic sector to which the plan is directed.
After a number of Australian laws banning advertising on television and sports sponsorship and forcing most sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has become online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local companies and websites, but it cannot be restricted on foreign pages.
"If you trade tobacco and just leave this small window to promote your products, the online space is the most convincing place to be," said Becky Freeman, public health researcher at Sydney University.
Freeman observed an increase of reviews on brands from "footed citizens" published on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
It should be asked whether it is only a private citizen who really likes Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble of making a video or whether any marketing company is behind it all.
British American Tobacco in Australia indicated that the industry focuses more on what the new legislation involves than marketing.
The industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to refuse the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unduly restricted, although none of these countries have a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek stated that the government had held talks with other countries that are considering applying similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001 Canada became the first country to introduce the obligation to include images in boxes.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, stricter laws are being considered.
In Australia many smokers are challenging.
"Photos don't affect me.
I simply don't care."
"Take the cigarette and keep the package," says Victor El Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Creationally, there's only one reason I'd quit smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack estate in the center of Sydney, says that the uniform boxes make it more complicated for him to put them in the booths.
"It usually took an hour to unroll a delivery; now I'm late four," Yu says.
"The government should have completely banned tobacco and then, it's, well, it's done and we're closing the store," he says as he lifts his hands up.
In a world that is constantly connected, it's not so bad to get bored a little bit
During this year's Thanksgiving holidays, I had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane in which we were flying suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to them.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting our duty-free stores.
But there are increasingly academics and child development experts who commend the kindnesses of boredom.
According to them, it is good that, both we and our children, we get bored from time to time.
Boring forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since, at present, most of us are connected to this or to that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we willingly accept boredom?
Yeah.
And no.
But we'll talk about it later.
Firstly, like many people, it was assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey says, Greek and Roman History Cathedral of the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" ("The Borrowing, An Animated History") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, it is not so.
"In fact, the story of boredom is very extensive," he says.
In the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin on the abstinence dating from the first century C.E.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many ways," says John D. Eastwood, professor of Psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the research published and putting the idea before a discussion group consisting of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "desiring, but unable, to participate in an activity that fills you".
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
She says that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, says, is "the change in the care process, associated with a low state of mind and a sense that time passes slowly".
Borrowing can sound awfully similar to depression.
Professor Eastwood, however, says that, although they may be related, people who are bored tend to view the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while those who are depressed feel that the problem has them.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what really happens to us is that we have problems to concentrate on.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading the article of a magazine.
Some groups heard in the next room a television program at any volume that had no connection, others listened to it with the low volume, so that it was only perceptible, while the third group did not hear the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the program with the volume below showed more boredom than the other two groups; it cost them to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you try to concentrate on a difficult or interesting task, the shift of attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph, in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like detecting defective pieces on a line of manufacture, a music that distracts you can help you not to be bored."
"In fact, we are now aware that moving or making garats, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help to combat it, as they make that person physically more alert."
"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and hold more information than those who are forced to remain silent," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it's like to be bored at some point: the delay of an airplane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring film.
But some people tend to be more bored than others.
In order to help measure it, some researchers developed in the 1980s a "scaling trend scale".
The scale includes issues such as "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that I'm interested that I don't have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of Psychology at the University of West Florida, says that, using these scales, researchers have discovered that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, in general, adolescents are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment involving 400 adolescents and their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
He discovered that 32 percent of the adolescents said that he would be bored while he was at school or doing his homework, while 23 percent said that he would be bored when he was not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they would be bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current abstinence rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said that what he knew was that "adultness is a period when boredom reaches its highest rates", largely because both children and adolescents are not given a great deal of control over what they want to do.
So, returning to my question of principle: is it good to be bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, when taken to the extreme, it can expose us to absurd physical risks, such as betting or falling into the consumption of substances as a method to combat it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers speak of the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
"The boredom is the way you have the brain to tell you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what's most appropriate.
If you're bored and you use that energy to play guitar or cook, that'll satisfy you.
But if you see television, you may be satisfied in the short term, but not in the long term.
"So, if your son is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or to do so," says Professor Fenske.
And "this ability to dose is applied to other situations", he points out.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself by himself, but learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don't think we really wanted to praise boredom.
But neither should we be overly critical of him.
Our goal should rather be to feel comfortable parts of the constant noise of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our way of seeing, we need to get bored more, but boredom is a desire too distressing and worrying as to relate it to something worth it," he says.
It points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated," he says, "it's hard to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops."
Colored: no instruction book for the new law on marijuana consumption
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community and soccer institute in southwest Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal throughout the state: possession of marijuana stones and a pipe used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends drove through Lamar, on the beaches near the Kansas border, when the police stopped them.
The police found marijuana in the car and some time later Orozco received a judicial quote for possession of drugs and related articles (lesser crimes involving each of them a fine of $100) in which he was informed of the date of the trial.
"They treat us like criminals," Orozco says.
And they are?
In the weeks following the vote in Colorado for the legalization of the holding of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of minor cases of drug possession depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of minor crimes for possession of marijuana are being cancelled both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was adopted.
Police departments have ceased to submit charges against the 21-year-olds by small-scale possession, which will be legally passed once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But the most conservative district prosecutors in Colorado have committed themselves to moving forward with cases open for possession of marijuana and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from Denver's suburbs to the western mountains, are voting to prevent the opening of marijuana shops, recently authorized in their communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I don't know what will be next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those who deal with the regulations in the state of Washington are also giving it back to the matter.
They continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacture, distribution and sale licences, all before the deadline, December 1, 2013.
They say that, for good or for bad, Colorado goes ahead with most states in terms of regulating the use of marijuana, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colored has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
"There is no real precedent that serves us as a model," he says.
Washington's law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December, which also leaves a year during which to swim between two waters, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but ownership will be legal.
In addition, there are some sensitive mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the requirement of the state to offer "appropriate access" to the authorized marijuana and its prohibition of performing cannabis business on a radio less than 300 metres away from schools, parks, playgrounds or child centres.
"In no place will it be more difficult to place an authorised cannabis business than in the urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson of the Centre for Legal Cannabis, a research group recently created.
On 21 November, Oates, the chief police officer of Aurora, sent an e-mail to his police officers informing them that the city's prosecutor would cease to bring legal proceedings for minor misconduct by possession of marijuana to persons older than 21 years of age and that the police would cease to bring charges against such crimes "with immediate effect".
Police chief Oates said that they would be responsible for implementing the city's rules governing marijuana cultivation for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to persecute drug traffickers and drug dealers.
In the county of Weld, North Colorado, the district prosecutor, Ken Buck, represents a more stringent vision.
After the vote, he ensured that his office would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly in order to pressure consumers and decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to intervene in judicial action against those offences that were criminal at the time they occurred," said Mr. Buck in a statement.
The answer has been complicated even in places such as the rural county of Mesa, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana.
The Grand Junction Police, the county's largest city, no longer cites adults for having small quantities.
Pete Hautzinger, the county prosecutor, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending cases of possession.
"I don't think you're wasting your time by continuing to enforce the law until this change," he said.
Although 55 per cent of the voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing marijuana consumption for recreational use within the government and the judicial system was easy.
Contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state show a marked ambiance among officials regarding the great ecological experiment in this state.
"It is a cultural barrier with the district prosecutors," says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing the accused of possession of marijuana and who is a local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of the Law on marijuana.
"They've been taking us so long before the courts that they can't really accept it as legal," he said.
Being the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way that if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are prepared to become test cases at the national level with regard to drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials have a new border of legal sales, they also look forward to receiving indications from the federal government, which still provides for the consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Defenders of the legalization of marijuana have the hope that the Department of Justice will intervene.
Although there have been some outstanding arrests of marijuana patients and sellers for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has allowed most of them to sell marijuana for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 more states.
"Although it is likely that drug agents will not pull down the doors to confiscate a small drug bag, there will probably be reactions to allow the operation of state-regulated shops for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted by the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, an drug policy exaggerator of Obama's administration.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect federal authorities to act.
Even before the day of the elections, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana store, even though it would be about a year before any of them could open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to approve it next week.
"We do not want to put ourselves in a situation in which we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level," explained Bob Nicholson, a town member.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favour of what the community voted in favour of what the state voted in favour of."
Many questions arise in this regard.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was beaten to death by Oxford for being a Tory."
He does not attack university students for his views only now
I don't remember any time in my life that I haven't been dreaming about getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in what I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposia of the contemporary era that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, in the two weeks of occupying my place at the Worcester College in the late 1980s to race history, I had already made the suitcases, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father fell apart and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper said that I had abandoned because I did not tolerate that some university partners had sexual relations in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson announced that I had gone because they forced me to drink in unscathed cups.
The truth was less fun.
Get out of there.
Yes, I did, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and harassment.
Not because of my extravagant name, not because it came from a private school.
I was faced with a single reason, which in the cone of the alleged illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbarous: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
Maybe they're wondering what's going on now.
Well, a number of reports indicate that a new generation of students from the right centre is suffering a similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students is such in Oxford that last week a group of them claimed the same level of equality of rights that homosexuals, disabled people and ethnic minorities have.
Conservative members of the JCR (group of grade students) of the Corpus Christi College affirm that they are "often seriously separated, personally attacked and treated as non-free people" by their political ideas.
They want to create a position in the Equal Opportunities Committee of their university college to ensure that they can express their views freely.
His situation was not favoured by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wunderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" (The Paradise: Young, Bright and Right) on students' politics and he presented the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
He showed the postgraduate student Joe Cooke, president of the Oxford University Conservative Party Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, lighting a plated suit and a stick with silver padding.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "Turkish heads" because of the introduction of higher enrolment rates.
Luke Black, a 20-year-old and vice-president of the Conservation Party Association of Nottingham University, said in a Sunday newspaper that "there is an increasing left-wing trend in universities.
People assume that we're like the Bullingdon Club without even even knowing us."
Samuel Roberts, aged 21 and a history student in Corpus Christi who presented the motion for greater protection, says that this environment is "uncomfortable", while 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, who is the elected president of the OUCA, says that the attitude of the JCR members towards the right-wing people has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual debate environment, as well as to the well-being of members," he said.
During my first weeks in Oxford, I was more alone than one.
I entered the university in September 1986, was a young, 18-year-old, terribly shy.
The hatred for the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, an old student, a title "honoris cause" after cuts in the funding of higher education.
The environment would have frightened any Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new university students, when the new students get to know and know the teachers, I received a sample of the bitterness that I expected.
I found that the cathedrals not only made the fat sight of the mob that was made of conservative university students, but they were happy to participate in it.
The policy of the strike of miners, the privatisation and opposition of the government to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached the seminary's wooden rooms.
The first to attend was to translate French texts from the 18th century and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Señorita Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now dead), "please translate the first paragraph."
I don't say any.
Pitt, a man down with a face that looked like a bunch of bizzoch, knew well how to eject bad billiards.
"Is it that the thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other university students laughed.
My eyes were burning from the tears I was trying to contain.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your free time, as long as you're not too busy knowing people," Pitt shouted.
I returned to my room as a soul in pain.
That night I sat alone at dinnertime at the university; then I felt a slight palm on my back.
He was a second-year English student called James who was introduced as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he kindly told me.
"I'm afraid that's how it goes.
They're messing with anyone who's suspicious of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but you know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even worse for you.
Many Tories have recently arrived to appear to be laborers."
Later, in a local pub, I tried to decimulate cowardlyly.
I insisted that I did not agree with all that Mrs Thatcher said.
That trick turned out to be useless.
A first year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economy who, paradoxically, had studied in Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I turned into a dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sexual relations?" asked one.
"You give each other a bat, don't you?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could you ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who thought like me just after nightfall?
Would you have to make me a laborer and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years I expected were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only open-ended cathedral was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History, for my university college.
They hated him because he was not only the Conservative party, but also thatcher's advisor in foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was just there.
He hated the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and because he adhered to the Marxist-Determinist vision of history.
In 1997 he accepted a cathedral at Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey.
"Here you won't be happy," he said.
I started to move daily from Oxford to my parents' home in London, finding refuge in my family and friends of the most open metropolitan mentality.
I told my father that he hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he was studying there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But if it is the best place in the world," he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear dreams needles.
Even my Communist friends always had an impeccable attitude."
His painful eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to joke.
I'd break my heart if you left it."
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and had given up his faith.
The following week, during a seminar where another cathedral of History had insinuated, speaking completely seriously, that I was a "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Red of shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "washed my brain" and called them "the stupid old ones."
The truce took little time.
It was my father who put the last key in my university career at Oxford.
That's when my father wrote two columns a week in Murdoch's press.
My door was locked with a key.
I was surrounded by fear and, past five minutes, my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I made the suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you'll call me weak crying.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only formed 14 Conservative Party prime ministers, but, to this day, it is hidden behind a reputation of nothing worthy of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", which has been opened this week in London, ABC speaks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian designer customers
Somerset House, former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentino: Master of the Costura", a retrospective apotheosis that gathers more than 130 high-dress clothes created by his "maison" for the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This sample is the colphon of a story whose only protagonist is "the lord" Garavani, but it could not have been written without its distinguished clients.
Valentino always has a sense of fascination with the distant and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until the next 3 March, there are many private letters and photos with the signature of the most granite of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: of humble and modest of the city of Voghera, in the north of Italy, to the icon of the international "get-set".
Being in love with reality has nothing to do with it.
"At least they don't delete the collars of their pills on your magnificent carpet as they make some beautiful celebrities of pop music," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and maintains generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his chalet at Gstaad," explains the exmuger of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate of the beauty forgotten as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, it's a star.
Valeria Mazza, shining a Valentine
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the modest.
Many years ago, after a show in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, decoration, food, music, everything was seen and felt its spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and dear," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the Paris High Costume Week in 1995.
"Never goes fashion because your designs are works of art," he says.
Alcurnia Show
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-recorded love.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous 60-metre-long gateway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to slide through the gateway to contemplate a "hearing" of the dream that lights Valentine's masterpieces, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for his wedding with Aristoteles Onassis, the dress that Monica Vitti used in "La Night", or a coat of wool and leather that belonged to the Farah Diba Empire.
In that public of manicures they highlight names such as Sibilla de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sofia de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the modest, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentine is like the first love, "unforgettable to forget."
I remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a dress "gillette" and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he gave me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
"I prefer him above others for his femininity, for his great love to women, because he highlights our beauty," adds the former duke of Feria.
I like the colors you use, have great light and are "donors" on your face.
The proportions are perfect.
The fashion princess Patricia della Giovapaola d'Arenbergtamaco can't forget the first time she saw Valentine.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of coming to have the age and the opportunity to use one of your night clothes...
Finally, the time came at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first Valentine's dress for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward of Ligne.
It was a red dress, with a fold of wings, "corsage" flagged and heard a word of honor.
"It was a dream made of reality," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is temporary," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her dress of the modest party with "the utmost care... because a dress is not only a dress, it's also the set of memories she wears."
The "king" of fashion
The great end of Somerset House's exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress at her wedding with Paul de Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the modest calls their ribs) to develop that silk marfil suit with pearl incrustrations, twelve different types of fitting and a four-metre-and-half-metre tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a hit from the high sewing of the late 20th century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Obnobled for years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, now Valentino is his best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest rank distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Laboro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion de Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of its clients' husbands.
"He has always called me attention to his refinement, his calmness, his clean and perfect appearance," admits D'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline of Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"It was impeccable, time doesn't pass for him."
If a princess says so...
The world's toughest office: Kawah Ijen's human mules
For four euros, the bearers of the Indonesian volcano play life and health by loading 70 kilograms of sugar through steep stone paths
There are people for whom your work is a hell and another who, literally, work in hell.
It is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by taking sugar from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To this end, it has to go down every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulphurous gas emanating from the earth’s insides is solidified when contacting the air.
After starting large sugar rocks, which in total reach about 70 kg, they are loaded in two bamboo baskets carrying on their shoulders through steep stone trails.
It is only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters high, but the worn-out bearers take more than 40 minutes to climb a tortoise step, keeping the balance and carefully measuring their steps so as not to be shaken and hit by the precipitation.
They know that any creature could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who spent years at the risk of Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents euros per kilogram of sulphur they extract
Once above, there is a passage between the tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys of circus and, laboring tirelessly the heavy canasts, walk three kilometers to the balance that a mining company has located a little lower, at 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents euros) per kilogram of sugar.
Then he sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents euros) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is generalized in everyday life and is used to manufacture candles, artificial fires, cosmetics, dynamite and even whitewashing sugar.
"As usual we carry 70 kilos, we pull out about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," Anto explains, who usually carries three daily doors.
Three hours ago each and it ends up being wet, but it allows you to gather 138,000 rupees (EUR 11.5) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for such an inhuman effort, it is the triple of what I would earn in the field.
"The newspaper of miners is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid to 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.2) on the day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167)," explains the carrier, who previously worked as an Albanian on the island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6,2 euros) a day and the tajo was not so hard, but then he returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, it is as overwhelming as the sugar: "I married a young Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought it to Java to become Islam."
Then he has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing constantly, and his eyes get irritated by the toxic gases
At 27 years of age, then he takes three playing the fight at Kawah Ijen, whose sugar has already begun to pass his bill despite having to cover his face with a special mask and glasses.
He has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing constantly, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that discharge the volcano.
It's the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I will work for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this nice young and smart one could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing an unclean wooden cabin with other bearers, it rises every day to the two of the morning because the sugar does not stop driving at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defining the shadows, then down to the crater humbing with a small lantern attached to his helmet, which he himself bought with his money.
Some 400 carriers load the sugar baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its sharp benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of the sugar to save costs or supply any equipment to the carriers, who work on their behalf and at all the weight.
In fact, it is not even part of the 30,000 rupees (EUR 2.5) recharged by camera, which, along with the arrival of 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.2), the keepers of this natural park charge tourists who go to photograph the volcano and their human mules.
"This work is for animals and not for humans," protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been in Kawah Ijen for three decades, since leaving the college.
He is able to raise up to 110 pounds, assures him that he will continue to work "everything he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, from 18 to 10 years old.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sugar burns the throat and listens to the eyes when the wind changes by improvising and traps the miners in thick columns coming out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of severe diseases... more, of course it is, of their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and joints in the shoulders, which have been damaged by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the canaster on its back, Uninik can already load only 50 kilos at its 53 years.
Every day, he and his companions start 15 tons of sugar on the volcano, which three trucks move to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a path of goats between the mall.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Uninik proclaims, opening his mouth, where he lacks a number of teeth.
Of his five children, the older, of 30 years old, also works in the transport of sugar.
Time passes, but poverty continues to be one of the toughest offices in the world, making the human mules of Kawah Ijen.
Singapore searches for babies to save the economy
Singaporens blame the race, the stress and the cost of property and education for not having children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we fulfill our civic duty and we create life!
These verses may seem to be part of an advertisement of mint pills, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references such as "We're going to put a bath (boil) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, hosts the hope that with the ad they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people perform "his national duty".
This is something pure of the internet, so we had to make it fun and fun.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we feel that this was a subject that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing fast-dating dinners.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we think, why don't we do as creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to make up a rap?
1.2 children
What doesn't take so lightly is Singapore's government.
It spends US$1,300 a year in policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservativeism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate of Singapore, according to its national population division, is currently in place in 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was above 2 - known as a retirement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans have any more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of Marriage Policy and Family of the National Population Division, says it is due to a "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marrying and forming a family," she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in singleness, and to the delay of marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aims to dramatically increase immigration to address the decline of the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are web sites where xenophobia is widespread only against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who criticize for maintaining low wages and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the Singapore government party experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the highest quotas and recordings for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequence
While the drop in the birth rate has known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has gone to control the number of small apartments, known as a " shoebox", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have had a lot of success in sales.
However, there is concern that they can promote a life-style of singleness and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the real estate company EL Developers, says that its " shoe boxes" are sold much faster than the larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that the units are exhausted days, even weeks, faster than the larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
It admits, however, that the new rules give clearer guidance to the developers, which were previously put to work if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national rate of birth, speaking to the Singaporeans working in the financial district of the similar centre that will not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are expensive, and so is education, so many people are putting it off," says a young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But it's important for me to count on my own money and time," says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, for as long as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to babysitting, the Singaporeans are the ones who have the last word.
Private offline is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is the quality of private life or "the scope of private life which is entitled to protect from any introduction".
What is private for a child under 16 years of age?
How does this definition apply in everyday life and in social networks?
Do you understand the dangers you are exposed to by ventilating online situations that would probably not be shared offline?
The Journal interviewed five boys between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent network users.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very mine", on the personal level, and "in the key and user name", when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets wouldn't go up to a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the private meaning of sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"It's very secret, my mom can know them, but not everyone," she says.
In FB I raise beautiful images or games.
I'm also interviewing my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a picture that wasn't mine, or someone that's making the joke," he says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscenity photographs, of naked people, of crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge makes sure to meet the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, has the key to one of the accounts.
I open Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just go up," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
No doubt he would never accept an application from an unknown person.
I wouldn't mind anyone recommending a stranger.
Joseph's 14-year-old case is different.
The adolescent has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter, admit not to know 20 of the people aggregated in his list of friends.
"Don't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one has insinuated him or asked him for the address of his home or phone number.
"If I was pressured or demanded just the bags of my account," he admits.
José followed Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not alone in the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
A friend of mine was horrified by a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money from him.
"I never knew who I was," he says.
According to José, the victim did not close the account.
"I only gave you privacy."
Then explain a series of steps to set up the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or pregnant situations.
Yes, I would, if I'm sick or I'm hungry.
"Although I know that's cyberbullying," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and licensed in Education and Learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means of seeking information, but with the appearance of these sites they changed the rules of the game," he said.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, a master at Pedagogy at Yale University and author of the National and Digital Immigrant Work, met these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are them, children and young people born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants we have to teach them, while we are still learning," he says.
He comments that the topic is complex, "because we are asking them to have a defined criterion on what it should or should not spread, publish or say to an age that maturity does not give for it".
"They are also selective when what matters most is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach what privacy is for children and adolescents is through questions that make them reflect.
"Tell them not to do it doesn't serve," she adds.
Then, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it online?
Or would you like them to post a photo of you as you published from a friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you tag photos of parties, did you ask permission for other people to tag them?
And one more, do they all need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to let them see that they should act on line as they do off line.
They're the same rules.
"An outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, it must also be on social networks," he says.
Watch
Esturado Guardia, a university professor, professor of primary education and educational consultant, notes that it is essential that family parents read the policies of social networks in mind.
In understanding each of the paragraphs, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be shared or published," he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind children of the lesson of "don't talk to strangers".
Finalize the Summit of the Union without making the Lima Declaration public
The VI Presidential Summit of the South American Union (Unasur) today concluded in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven assistant mandatearies.
Efé tried several times to access the document signed at the VI Regular Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but sources of Chancellor and Presidency indicated at the beginning that it would be delivered after the closure, but then stated that it would be published on the Peruvian Government website at some point.
When consulted by the text, they noted that the content had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief press statements.
The access of journalists to the information of the Summit was restricted at all times.
During the day only, the unsound video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room with the message "private session, restricted audio".
The few information he circulated among reporters was delivered by the press spokespersons from some of the Governments of the Unasur who attended the meeting, although not Peruvian.
The only paper released during the day was the list of assistant presidents, resulting in hundreds of journalists from various national and international media requesting more data.
Subsequently, the Peruvian Presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was Humala's statement, not the official document that closed the summit.
In October, Peru was the host of the Third Summit of South-Arab Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite its insistent demand from the press, the so-called Lima Declaration had not also been disseminated.
The official website of ASPA can confirm that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities endeavoured to ensure secure transmission systems for all journalists, but limited the maximum amount of information available.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a failure of the Hague Court to establish a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they would respect the decision of the (CIJ), which began Monday in The Hague to hear the allegations from both sides, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will observe and execute the judgment defining the differences that we are taking to this international court today," Humala said, together with her Chilean couple.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a respectable country of international law, a peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international tribunals," Piñara added, and greeted Humala, together with the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they will submit to the IGC occurred after Colombia this week to denounce the Bogotá Pact for which it had accepted to submit to the judgements of that international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered gravely wrong.
The summit was held with the absences of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 following the resignation of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the debate in the morning and closing the summit shortly after midnight in Lima.
The mandate officer read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and the lines of action for 31 projects among South American countries had been established for a total of $17 billion in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he said that UNASUR countries will take "significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship for what we are expanding the residence agreements".
It reported that actions are being promoted to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, Internet access at low prices in all the countries of South America, and to address the risks of natural disasters jointly and efficiently".
With a crisis Europe, "the economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should serve to expand our productive matrix and brighten a better future for our peoples," Humala added.
"We have decided to favour a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South America spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... joining our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian President in a read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located on the cross-sectional axis of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give any further details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for its reintegration into the South American Union", which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to maintain itself as a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations between neighbours, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this regard, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he was hoping to meet with his partner from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat the maritime difference in respect of a failure of the IGC, questioned by Bogotá.
"The morning (Saturday) is possible to have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We are going to review all these paths, they are not exclusive, even the Treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega I hope I can tell you that we manage this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico where they planned to attend the leadership of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the block's Defence Ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in the area of Defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay integrate UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the presidency for the time being of the regional bloc.
"Suramerica must learn from Europe to integrate citizenship": Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "Suramerica, in this case, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the South American Union (Unasur), held in Lima, declared to the Peruvian state TV that Europeans "killed themselves in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a country".
In that regard, it defended the project to establish South American citizenship that encourages the member countries of the Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved by any South American country, as is already the case with the Andean Community members, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to bring us back to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian President also showed support for the recommendation of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the pretext of undermining the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who have signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who give the cathedral are never committed to anything and, instead, we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States," declared the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured her that she was not sorry for that decision because she did not betray its principles, but that she respected its "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that, at the time, "there were grounded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and did not respect its process".
He also criticized Swedish justice for demanding that an alleged sexual offence be investigated in their territory when "Swedish law allows it to be done through videoconference, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London".
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange’s physical and mental health will deteriorate.
"I haven't talked to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian envoy.
What there is is the danger of damaging your physical and mental health because you are locked in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
"It complicates the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the granting of a safe conduct allowing him to travel to Ecuador, was in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities and stressed that there had been discussions with London in search of a solution to the closure of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, that word we do not use in this case, but there have been permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is making a series of procedures in different European instances," he said.
And he felt that "if Britain tomorrow he's safe conduct this is over."
And if Sweden, as perfectly permitted by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, asks Mr. Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or asks him via Skype tomorrow this problem ends.
Correa took advantage of it to reaffirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press and argued that what she did not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the evil faith and the lie, which distort freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not evil and perverse politicians but bad journalists according to profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this regard, it was welcomed that these journalists are no longer "the bankers or the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador", and it went on to be re-elected "will deepen in the revolution to continue the right path and direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto in Paraguay at least until its next election, arguing that the organization "should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and the covered golpism of legality" because it "defaced the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian president also considered the "perfectly relevant" wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua now the maritime boundaries between the two countries after the fall of the Hague International Court of Justice, which benefited from Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
There is no such failure at the moment.
It's a problem between a South American country and a Central American.
Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome by the willingness to walk together.
It is necessary to process them widely to overcome them and to continue.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the maritime border dispute held in the same court in Peru and Chile and believed that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries undertake to accept failure as hard as possible".
In reference to the opportunity presented as a candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive mandate, he pointed out that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard".
Correa assured that if she loses the February 2013 commissions, she will withdraw from public life.
In staff I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as Ecuador's, that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed that likely victory, because we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
To win would be my last period in the presidency and from there we're out of public life.
If we lose the same thing.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routinely, that was expected to go through the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean a relapse in the health state of President Chávez," he commented.
The head of the Ecuadorian State today participated in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the South American Union (Unasur) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are the cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed as a result of the test: positive AIDS.
"It was as if a bomb fell on me," he said, remembering the moment of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make "slower", without obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness and began to inform himself about it; with such effort he had already celebrated his birthdays 43.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), to which it arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine at the beginning of the 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, up to the director of a IMSS clinic he avoided saying goodbye to him "because he brought a cut."
So having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do it with quality of life.
However, ignorant of your disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "aborted" its immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
At 31 years of the onset of AIDS in the world, at least in the first reported cases, "the great achievement at this time means that the survival of a patient who begins treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG's HIV Unit chief Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after mentioning that this information was used in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infecttologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impact on the immune system that patients present at the start of the diagnosis, with better expectations for those who are not drug users: from up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, the above means that the person who receives the HIV positive diagnosis at 25 years of age, under these terms "while he is in control, he can live without problems until 75 years of age", the interviewer explained.
To measure this advance, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
Although mortality has significantly decreased in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS fell from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the incidence of AIDS, 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died.
Only 255 people in Jalisco died in 2011, and there are 187 deaths until May of this year; however, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been ensured since 2005.
- Why is there still death?
- I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I visualize it, that's how it happened in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had a lack of medication the problem is that patients get very advanced because they do not know their condition of infection, that is, in late stages of the disease.
He said: "Nine out of every ten patients arrive when they already have some opportunistic infection what they have to do to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to make earlier diagnosiss and, therefore, they have to offer mass detection tests to all people who require it."
In its proposal, experts and officials of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who sought to test themselves to a particular laboratory, were only motivated by a friend and, despite his short age, he was already in a stage of AIDS and even suffered sarcoma from Kaposi, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm already going to die, I'd better go back three times a week," they say, not in my case.
The change was to improve, feed me well, exercise, take the medications.
To date, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but co-responsible, I care for myself and the other person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his witness those today, in the context of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
To test whether they were at risk, to know sooner or later if they are positive HIV, is better and if they already have the diagnosis, to learn that they can live like any person, being responsible.
That, his message, summarizes the call for battle on AIDS this 2012.
Condons behind the pointer
Big are the gaps between health programs and the common citizen, Ricardo Salazar, a tobacco journalist who has assumed the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of a hundred, and that's very good but it turns out that there are those today, still, who don't have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want them for?" was a common question, with sour and value judgments of social workers, school instructors, pharmacists and health personnel, to whom adolescents do not want to be exposed, the communicator assured them.
He proposed to re-orient this inefficiency distribution; that condoms not only be behind the indicators and those hundred are found in public bathroom dispatchers from the sites that young people frequent.
It is not to motivate promiscuity.
Nor is it a matter of paying the keys and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied, asking him if he would have had reservations in his administration.
"That's not sexuality, it's best to approach condoms who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13,435 accumulated cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4th national place in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th HIV.
92% of the contagion corresponds to sexual pathways, 6% to blood pathways, and 2% to perinatal pathways.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can be living with HIV because there are 4 to 5 people who do not know about it by a recorded case.
Ratified by a United States Appeals Court, a judgment that does not know the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt achieved through a commercial competition in Mexico, the scenario puts a precedent to any national firm with branching in the neighbouring country with solvency problems.
It would therefore be said that the procedures at the bottom of the companies that allow Mexican laws to survive are not valid in the country of bars and stars, contrary to international conventions.
In the practical field, the spade to the judgment issued on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankcarrotas court for the northern district of Texas, leaves the Mexican firms defenseless in the face of the possibility of improvising their properties across Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to approach the United States Supreme Court, claiming three inconsistencies.
On entry, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must be governed by the United States Breaks Act, the Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings are the commercial competition processed in Mexico.
The first point would be to ignore international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational companies.
In fact, to that end, the United Nations Model Law on the Uniformity of International Trade Law was established, being placed as an arbitrator at the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the vote of the inter-company, recognised in the critical mass of the commercial competition the debts of the subsidiaries of Vitro with their matrix would not have been achieved by the majority required to approve the restructuring.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro's was not the first case in which the scheme was accepted.
There are an average of dozens of examples, including Agrex and Mexican Commercial, whose inter-company debts were down to the Federal Institute of Commercial Competitions.
The truth is, moreover, that by remaining the votes of the subsidiaries, the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the United States Courts, i.e. the "buitre" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved most.
The vote would have been 45 per cent against 37.
The data omits the Court of Appeal.
From another angle, this blame on Vitro for the difficult situation that he faced from 2008 to the relief of the serious economic crisis that he faced in the United States, by catching up with the country.
Soon, the signing of the González Sada family will bring a appeal for review before the Court of Appeal itself so that the vote can be reached in its entirety, that is, the five judges, given that they voted only three.
If this does not prosper, it will be claimed that Cerciarare's appeal requires the review of the proceedings by a superior body, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The serious case is that the court signed a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figure of friends curiae ("friend of the Court"), detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Merchant Competitions Act, noting that it was derogated from the conventions signed by both countries to incorporate it into Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
Moreover, it is noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations International Trade Commission, that is, the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambo: take Vitro and take him to the country.
General's Balance
Sleeped for several months the complaints placed on the table by the Mexican Aviation Trade Unions against the company's ex-wife, Gastón Azcarraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, has already found the bottle neck.
The body headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal claim against the National Banking and Values Commission to which the accused of obstructing justice is charged.
According to this, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from Bank IXE's F/589 Trust, on behalf of Mexico, 198 million weights.
Resources would have been channelled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Manager.
As you know, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Search Dragon Mart
Assembled on the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as you know, of a huge center of sales and distribution of products from the country of the wall in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, with a soccer accommodation area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the south-east zone to oppose the monumental thing that had taken place in part of protected areas and planted the mother of all the shelters against the industry.
ACTA died
Underlining a request by the Government of the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the ambassador of Mexico in Japan signed the Commercial Anti-Falsification Agreement, known for its English stamps as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the matter has already gone to the file.
As you know, the action was made despite the fact that the Senate itself had declassified the possibility of considering it to attack freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term homex
In addition to paying long-term debts without affecting short-term debt, the Homex housing developer is placing on the market Bursatile Certificates for 500 million weights.
The issue is the first of four identicals that offer to pay interest every 28 days.
Nace Competival
Integrated by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet companies, information technology leaders, have just been born a consortium with competitive social reasons, whose goal will be the market of services for software clusters in Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "The balance has been my life"
Trotamundos of the basketball Héctor "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years linked to the play of the table and, thanks to him, he traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of the local basketball as wide as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has.
And it is that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was involved in sports for more than 60 years, he was a player of lower categories, a player of the National Higher Balance, held and directed at the BSN with the Bayamón Vaqueros or president of the Federation of Balonesto.
"I put a lot of hats in my life through my life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a visit from First Hour to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"The balance has been my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating when making such a statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and monuments that mark his wide journey, thus testify to it.
Bayamón in the Heart
Of all, the ones who cherish with greater excitement are the ones who commemorate their passage through the Vagueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years old acting as co-powered or mastered of the French.
"These were my best years, the ones I enjoyed most because I had had the opportunity to be part of eight Vaqueros champions since 1967, he was already an heir, co-power or leader.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five championships raced from 1971 to 1975.
And then I fired myself with one in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut in the BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," said Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had headed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a very strong player, of 6"7" height.
Do you want it?"
And that was Mincy's principle, one of the best players that Puerto Rico has had.
Bartow then recommended the sniper Raymond Gausse, who was native and was one of our best shooters.
I remember saying that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring another one.
The Vagueros and Gaussian champion enjoyed it, but already at a distance, as for 1988 it was already a federal mandate.
For that time, he preferred to enjoy his executions and Mincy's on the National Team.
I remember when we won the U.S. for the first time during the 1989 Preolimpic period in Mexico.
Then came the World of 1990, where we came to fourth place and must have been bronzed not to be by that Canadian arbitrator who made us repeat the final game for the second time, Reyes said.
Is this 1990 World Group the best National Team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one that won the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that of the Panamericans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave it to the United States team, which was quite similar to what we won the bronze in the world.
This team not only repeated Mincy, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had "Toñito" Colon and James Carter young, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Qujote" Morales, who could not have been in the 90th due to a knee injury.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Preolimpic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role-players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitiner in replacement of the players suspended by the Mar del Plata Panamericano lio, we won gold against all the prognosis.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
No doubt, that was Piculín Ortiz.
Its numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level as Piculín did.
And that doesn't count on his trajectories in the different leagues he played.
Who's been the best borician leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good layer including Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From young people, I really like Leo Arill's work.
What do you think your greatest achievement in the federation?
It was part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 1990s BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What did you have to do?
There were things that I would have liked to implement, such as the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, Ponce's boys only play in their area and only face teams from other islands of the island in national playoffs.
Right now, children travel and play too badly.
At least I see the fruit of the compulsory certifications and course for executives, table officers and arbitrators.
I'm so glad.
What are you doing now?
What I do is listen to music, watch videos of music from my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy my wife's company, Isabel, which has always been with me.
Kills the actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth (Texas), was globally famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, more known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he incarnates a man of business without scrupulous, malicious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate predator J.R. Ewing in the "Dallas" TV series, became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to complications of cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the producer house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his dear home town of Dallas, again representing the iconic role he liked most," said the family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played her wife's role in the original series and in the century, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, said her advertiser, Jeffrey Lane.
I was happy to meet everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, fun, graceful, loving and talented, and I'll surprise him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the maximum," Gray said in a communiqué.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and recognized that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995 he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and was transplanted.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by the NBC chain from 1965 to 1970.
In it he interpreted Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is changed when he finds an attractive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and leads her to live with him in his home.
He was also a protagonist of two comedians who were not long in the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included papers well received by criticism in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterly interpretation of the enchantingly disgusting J.R. that led Hagman to his maximum star.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was in the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", thought to generate expectations about a full episode of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, generated an international speculation and millions of dollars risked in betting houses.
It also helped to give the series a record of hearing at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a chapter of November 1980, an average of 41 million televisionrs tuned it and turned it into "Dallas" in the second most visible entertainment program in history, after the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was J.R.'s cousin Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. pregnant her and then threatened her with a hooker unless she was outside the city, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an insatiable corruption with a charismatic smile: a deceitful businessman and a unfaithful husband who tried to get his wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be hospitalized.
"I know what I want on J.R.'s stone," Hagman said in 1988.
I should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only deal he's lost.
Principal Victoria, a co-portagonist of the original series, reminded Hagman on Friday as someone "great, inside and out of the screen".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who have the luck to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were transmitted a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
The recording of five of the chapters for the second season had already been completed and a sixth was in process, the chain reported.
There was no statement by Warner or TNT about how the Hagman series will manage the loss.
Oriento de Fort Worth, Texas, was a son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who stared classical works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he married lawyer Ben Hagman in 1931.
He was lucky at the New York Theatres in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where they live many celebrities.
In 2001, he titled his "Hello Darlin': Talll (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything there that I thought it would hurt someone or affect them in any way," said the Associated Press at that time.
After the liver transplant, he became a promoter of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist the fearful patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I gather with them when they come for their surgery, and then," he said in 1996.
I try to offer something of comfort, as "they don't fear, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a while, but it'll be okay."
He was also an activist against smoking habit and participated in several campaigns.
Start a course that explores the "End of the World"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistable angel: The end of the "large return account" of the Mayan Calendar, December 21, to which many people have been attached as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what was expected of him in the next couple of months: the cataclysmic hurricane Sandy, a tax precipice that some have called "deudarmagedone" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian theologians of the end of time believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester there has been," Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If one analyzes what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good time.
And they remember it's bad for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last of history.
In Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vucker is teaching the course "Medios, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, it could break up a war.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare with examples of real life.
"I have tried to inform the students of what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
In the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, the Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of History of Art and Anthropology, have made teamwork to give a course, entitled only "The End of the World".
"We don't add '2012' to always count on the option to give the course again, in case the world doesn't end," Restal said.
Despite the "imminent ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final examination will be taken on the evening of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the same night that the world is supposed to end," said Restal.
The courses were quite popular.
"He sat down in two hours," Restal said about his high-average student course, which he filled with 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, of people who were wondering if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridged Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Haddonfield's Religion and Sociology in New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that apocalyptic, secular, or religious mentality is only a matter of comfort or of the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Nursing, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a class that could teach that," he said.
I enjoy it.
But no interviewer - and much less a teacher - said to believe in the expiry date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy and in a way we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a last-year student in Temple, aged 21 and West Chester.
Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, said Restal.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which rises to several centuries, in which people react to the changes around them by preaching the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
"On the other hand, people don't think about it," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle who is teaching courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about some course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, implying an exception to a superior authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restal pointed out that over the years many days of the final trial have been spoken of, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will start to think immediately on the next date" or to think that on 21 December is the beginning of a seven-year period that will end the world.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they were thinking about going to parties "of the end of the world."
"Maybe I call some friends to laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
