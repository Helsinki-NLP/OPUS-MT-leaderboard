The members of the Wales Assembly are concerned that “they seem like plants ”
Some Members of the Assembly abstained from the proposal to change their name to MWP (sometimes Members of the Wales Parliament).
This relates to the intention to replace the Assembly's name with the Wells Parliament.
The members of the assembly were concerned that this could cause fun at political level.
One member of the Labour Assembly said that his group was concerned that "it was embarrassing for Twp and Pwp".
Non Welsh readers: The language "twp" means "crazy", and "pwp" means "something".
A member of the Plaid Assembly said that the whole group was "unsatisfied" and offered alternatives.
Velso's conservative claimed that his group was "open" because of the change of name, but noted that it was a reduction in the word from MWP to "green".
For example, the English language of Yorkshire is thought to have been similar to the English word u.
The Assembly's commission, which is currently preparing draft legislative amendments, said: "The final decision on the names of all the members of the Assembly will, of course, be the issue of the members themselves."
In 2017 the law of the Wales Government granted the Assembly of Wales the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultations on the proposals calling for strong support for the Assembly to be known as the Wales Parliament.
As regards the name of the members of the Assembly, the Commission gave priority to members of the Wales Parliament or WMP, but during public consultations MWP called for the greatest support.
Members of the Assembly are clearly proposing alternatives, but efforts to reach an agreement may become a headache for President Elin Jones, from whom it is expected to submit draft legislative amendments within a few weeks.
Legislation on the scope of reforms and other amendments to the work of the Assembly, including rules on the plan of disqualification of the Assembly member and the Committee's system.
During the legislative debate, the Assembly will have a decisive vote on what they should be called.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on the change in the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The general vote was organised to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its province, Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that its name is a claim to the territory of Greece and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's efforts to join the EU and NATO.
In opposition to the plebiscite on the change of name, Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanova said the vote would be rejected.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the change of name is simply a price which is simply to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's and other churches have suffered from Harlem's difficulties
"The old people I spoke to said that historically on each corner there was a bar and church," Adams said.
– Today you don't find either one or the other."
He said he understood why the bars disappeared.
“Today people interact differently,” he said.
– There are just no neighborhood sites where people gather all the time."
Speaking of the churches, he is concerned that the money that would be received after the sale of the property will not go as long as the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will return to where they started.”
He added that the churches could be replaced by multicastes with cooperative apartments, where people who would not help the remaining saints would live.
"Most people who buy cooperative apartments in these multiples will be white," he said, "and will therefore speed up the moment when the church is completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of these people who moved to these cooperative apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built in 1870 in white congregations, before Harlem became a black metropolis, a metropolis community, and St. Martin’s church was built decades later.
The first white Methodist Congregation was excavated in the fourth century C.E.
After the construction of the black congregation in the vicinity, the building was named.
The church of St. Martin took over the Black Congregation with the priest John Howard Johnson, who led the minority boycott on 125th Street, at the main store in Harlem, where he was refused to hire or assign to higher-ranking blacks.
The building was destroyed in 1939, but because of the plans made by his spiritual father, Johnson’s cousins, they ordered the emperor to rebuild it.
The priest David Johnson, the son of the spiritual father Johnson, and the heir to St. Martin’s church, honored the emperor with the nicknames of the poor.
The experts who beat the lion's throat called it the "cultural lobby" and the "unchangeable historical instrument".
At the University of Michigan, Tiffany Ng also mentioned that it was the first in the world to be played by a black musician Dionysius A. Lind. 18 years ago he began to play a larger chariot in the Church of Riversaid.
Merriweather said that St. Martin's church did not change his other musician.
What has happened in the last few months in St. Martin's church was a complex history involving architects and contractors, some of which have been invited to the worlds of the church, others by the bishop of the Episcopal Church.
Zacritija – the organ of the parapsia management composed of world leaders, in July, expressed concern at the bishop that the bishop "will try to transfer the costs" to Zacritija, although it did not build the architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained that the bishops lacked transparency.
Ricly in California injured the recipient of a 13-year-old bear
The officials reported that on Saturday, he attacked a 13 - year - old boy when he was in California on the opening day of the Umar season.
It was surrounded 7 hours ago by Ensinitas in the morning near the beach of Light.
Chad Hamelis San Diego's performance KSWB-TV said that he broke up with his friends on Saturday morning about half an hour when he heard the boy calling for help, and then came back with the group to help him get out of the water.
Hamelis told me at first that the boy was anxious to catch the lobster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting: “I’m excited!
I'm impressed!"
Hamelis said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire cell was missing.
"I called out to everyone to drink from the water: "The water is floating in the river!" Hamelis added.
The boy was taken to the San Diego Children's Hospital, where he was recognized to be critical.
It's not known what kind of boy was attacked by a shark.
The rescue captain, Larry Giless, told the media that a shark had been observed in that area a few weeks ago, but it was decided that it was not a dangerous species of sharks.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries from the upper part of the body.
The officers closed the beach from Casablanca Pont to Ensinitas Swamium for 48 hours due to the investigation and protection.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to commit to the UK beauty market
"Sainsbury's" takes over "Boots", "Superrug" and "Debenhams" with the beauty of the universal shop-style sections where specialists will work.
Actively moving to the UK’s 2,8 billion-weighted sterling beauty market, which continues to grow and the sales of fashion and household goods are falling short, more beauty items will be tested by 11 shops across the country and more shops will be installed next year if they are successful.
Investments in beauty are growing, and shopping centres are looking for ways to use a table, sometimes for televisions, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's reported that it would double its beauty range to 3,000 product names, including signs such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of "L'Oreal", "Maybelline" and "Burt's Bees" will also get more local brands in areas similar to those in stores such as "Boots".
The shopping centre also re-issues its “Boutique” makeup range, most of which are vegan – this is increasingly required by younger buyers.
In addition, the Fragranance Shop will test discounts in two Sainsbury's shops, from which the first week of which opened in Kroidon, South London, and the second one this year will open in Seli Oake, Birmingham.
Due to the purchase of the internet and the desire to buy small quantities daily, shopping malls of local retailers need to make more efforts to attract people to visit there.
The CEO of Sainsbury's Mike's Coupe said that the company's shops are becoming more and more like universal stores, as the sales centres' networks are trying to fight the cheaper Aldi and Lidl stores by offering more services and not food.
Sainsbury's has included Argo's shops in hundreds of shops and has also installed a number of Habitat shops, because two years ago, they bought both networks, which are said to have strengthened the sale of food and their acquisition was more profitable.
The previous attempt by the mall to renew its beauty and medicine department was unsuccessful.
In the beginning of the first decade of this century, Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots, but the union ended up arguing how to distribute revenues from pharmaceutical shops in malls.
A new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 125 million pounds a year ago to the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network in its 281 pharmaceutical shops.
It was said that Lloyds' contribution to this plan was added to the extended range of luxury leather care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
The commercial director of Sainsbury's said: "We have changed the exterior and atmosphere of beauty to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be prepared to give advice.
The range of our trademarks is designed to meet every need, and because of the attractive environment and comfortable places, we are now a beautiful place that brings challenges to the old way of buying."
Peter Jones is "accompanied" because Holly Willoughby ended his 11 million-weight sterling transaction with him.
"Dragon Den" star Peter Jones "entered" after the TV show leader Holly Willoughby terminated 11 million pounds of sterling deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
H. Willoughby no longer has time for their home circulation and accessories brand "Truly".
The couple’s business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old "This Morning" series was announced in Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left a lucrative mark of lifestyle in order to focus on his new major contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, caught the Dragons Den star Peter Jones.
The sources say that Jones was "accommodated" at the meeting on Tuesday, when the golden television girl at his business empire headquarters in Marlou (Bakingamshire) admitted that she will no longer be given time for a new deal of up to 1.5 million sterlings to be assigned to his household’s supplies and accessories brand Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was expected to double H. Willoughby’s 11 million weight sterling asset.
Since he was 37 years old at the Instagram's "Truly", Jones left Britain and went to one of his summers.
The source said: "Truly" has so far been one of the most important Holly priorities.
This was to be her long - term future, lasting over the next few decades.
Its decision to leave was amazing.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday because the beginning was so close.
Marlou has a warehouse full of ready to sell."
Experts believe that the "The Morning" lead, which is one of the most financially successful stars in the United Kingdom, can cost the company millions because of large investments in products, starting on the floor and the candles and finishing the clothes and household items, as well as the delay in starting things.
And that could be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, H. Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been in close contact with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for decades.
In 2016, H. Willoughby and T. Cappu established Truly, and 52-year-old P. Jones joined the fight as president.
The couple are vacationing together and Mr Jones has 40% of the shares of Baldwin's television production company.
H. Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace the ITV series "I'm A Celebrity" led by Anta McPartlina.
The close source of Jones said yesterday: "We will not know his business."
We talked hard and “then we fell in love ”
He laughed at the criticism received from the media about the comment submitted, which some might consider to be "non-presidential", as well as the positive response of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trumpas give up so much?
With a short voice, the “new leader” said:
"I didn't say anything."
He pointed out that Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was held a major step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
However, the nuclear disarmament negotiations are under way.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's highest-ranking diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders on Saturday at the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not receive a "responsibility" from the United States due to the early disarmament of North Korea.
He noted that instead of continuing sanctions to maintain pressure, the United States continued.
In his short speech, he expressed a much more optimistic attitude.
"We are very well followed by North Korea," he said.
– We're going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be caught.
We now support these excellent relations."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim led to positive results: it ended with rocket tests, relief aid and return to the support of the American home.
He defended his unusual attitude by talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be a president, but instead of having 10,000 people who want to go to this crowded arena, we'll have about 200 people standing here," said Trump, pointing to the minima that is standing in front of him.
Indonesian tsunamis and earthquakes devastated the island, killing hundreds of people
Following the earthquake of Lombok, foreign non-governmental organisations were notified that their assistance was not necessary.
Although more than 10% of Lomboko's population had been deployed, this was not announced in the national disaster – a necessary condition for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it was very clear that there is no need for international aid, and that is why it is a bit difficult," said Sumbun.
Although "Save children" is preparing a team to travel to Palu, it is not clear whether foreign workers can work on the spot.
The representative of the National Disaster Agency Sutopo said that the Indonesian officials were assessing the situation of Paul in order to know whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
In the light of the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country has not yet prepared its natural temperament.
Although the shelters from the tsunami were built in Aceh, they are not common on other shores.
Because of the apparent lack of tsunami-warning sirens, Paul, despite the announced warning, was likely to increase the lives of the dead.
Traveling among many Indonesian islands is the best time possible.
In the face of disasters, logistics is becoming even more complex.
Lomboke, a hospital ship that treats victims of earthquakes, sails to Palu, but the new disaster will reach its destination at least three days later.
President Yoko Widodo chose to restore Indonesia's infrastructure in the centre of his election campaign, he generously issued money to roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding did not give peace to the Yoko administration, as it will again take part in the elections in the coming years.
Joko also faces pressure from the remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims respect more conservative forms of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands escaped from their homes, for Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using cats, guns, and other simple weapons.

Parliament's statues are hit by the last blow of the "historic rewriting" dispute.
Its removal would be a poetic justice for the destruction of the cultural and religious heritage of the Taliban, for which the fanatic followers of Cromwell Puritans are responsible.
However, Cromwell’s friend, J. Crick, described the proposal as “a stupidity” and “a attempt to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “During the current discussions on the transfer of the statues, the statue of Oliver Cromwell to the House of the Westminster had to be irrefutable.
Cromvelis did not declare the iconoclassism of the English Civil Wars and did not perform.
Perhaps not that Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of Father Tom in the past century.
The beautiful image of the Cromwell created by Sero William Hamo Thorneycroft is a reflection of the 19th century's perspective and the figure that many still value to be respected.
Goldsmith The Sunday Telegraph said: “Many people, perhaps at the end of the 19th century more than today, Cromvelis was considered a defender of parliament against external pressure, and this was, of course, a monarchy.
Whether this is completely accurate, historically disputed so far.
One thing is clear that the medieval conflict of the 17th century formed a later development of our nation, and Cromvelis became an outstanding figure representing one of the sides of this account.
For the LORD hath preserved him, and hath preserved him, and hath preserved him, and hath blessed him.
Pig killed dead by a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, the pig attacked and killed the farmer in the Chinese market in the southwestern part of China.
On Sunday, Morning Post reported that he had found a dead man named Yuan. Because of the damaged artery, he was entombed with blood and slept next to a pig in the Liupansu turg, Guidzhou province (South China).
On 30 May 2005, the pig producer in Sining (Cinghaya Province, China) prepared to inject the vaccine into pigs in pigs.
He reported that on Wednesday, along with his half brother from the neighboring province of Junan, he intends to travel to the markets to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, the half brother found his family dead and found a door opened to the nearby village.
And he said, There was in the swine a great multitude, and his mouth was filled with blood.
As stated in the report, the court expert confirmed that the pig weighed 250 kg.
“Guyang Evening News” quoted as saying: “My cousin’s legs were bleeding and injured,” said a cousin named Wu, .
The material filmed by the security camera showed Yuan entering the turgi 4.40 hrs to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
A man who was killed did not belong to Yuan or his half brother.
The Turkish leader told Evening News that the pig had to be locked away from other people, and keep up until the police collect evidence on the spot.
It is reported that the Yuan family and the Turkish authorities are in charge of the death compensation.
Although few, however, cases of swine infestation were reported earlier.
In 2016, pigs attacked the woman and her husband at the farm in Massachusetts, and the man was particularly vulnerable.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 295 pounds [295 kg] pressed Velso’s farmer to the tractor and pressed him until the animal was taken by his wife.
After the pig sat down on the Oregano farmer in 2012, a Manitoba farmer, CBC News, said that pigs are usually not aggressive, but aggression can lead to the taste of blood.
“They are just playful.
They like pain, they're very thin... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to respect them accordingly," he said.
The "judgment" of Uruguay will bring a large rain to the U.S.
It is predicted that the hurricane is weakening through the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring plenty of things to all North Mexico and the United States.
On Sunday from 5 o'clock in the morning, Rosa moved 137 km/h as 1 category hurricane and was 620 km south of the Euchenian Peninsula (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, on the edge of the Pacific begins to form the extended low pressure area and moves east, towards the western coast. As Rosa approaches the California peninsula on Monday as an atoll storm, she will begin to carry a large atoll humidity to the north, to the south of the United States.
In some areas of Mexico, Rosa will bring up to 25 centimeters [25 cm] of rain on Monday.
Then the humidity of the adhesion, interacting with the surrounding low pressure area, will bring in in the coming days a great flood of rain to the south.
Instead of 2.5 to 10 centimeters of rain, it will cause dangerous sudden flooding, crash current, and possible precipitation in the desert.
Due to the high humidity in some places, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona, a drop of 5 to 8 centimeters per hour will occur.
5 to 8 centimeters of rain is expected in the south-west regions, particularly in the main part of Arizona.
As a result of the nature of the around rain, there was a sudden flood and a rapid deterioration of the conditions.
In the near future, the storms of the adjectives would be particularly poorly thought to attract the desert with their feet.
The heavy rain cannons can be turned into flowing rivers, and the percussion would result in wind and dust.
The approaching low pressure area will bring some local heavy rains to the southern coast of California.
It is likely that more than 1 centimeter of droplets can cause a small drop in flow and the roads can become smooth.
These would be the first peaks of the wet season in the region.
Some of the ferrets will begin to approach Arizona’s late Sunday and early Monday, and later rain will spread late Monday and Tuesday.
After the great rains of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and South America, it will rise on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations can occur in all the United States, because the Arctic is west, but it will be quite warm in the coastal zone.
This sometimes leads to major changes in temperature in small distances.
On Sunday, there was a great example of huge temperature differences in the Central US.
The temperature of Kansas Sichi (Egypt) and Omaha (Nebraska) is almost 20 degrees different from the temperature of St. Louis and Di Moino (Ajova).
In the coming days, the summer heat should rise again and cover more places.
It is expected that in the major central and eastern parts of the United States, from the Great South Plains to the north-east areas, a warm October with a high temperature of 27 degrees.
The temperature in New York should rise to 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that in the eastern United States the first half of October will be higher than the average multiannual temperature.
More than 20 million people attended the Bretto Kavanaugh court meeting
More than 20 million people were watching on Thursday during the six television broadcasts, paying attention to the statements made by the Supreme Court candidate Bretto Kavanaugh and Christian Blasey Ford in the 1990s.
However, the political debate continued after the broadcasters had stopped regular programmes on Friday's last minute change: the Arizona Senator had an agreement to conduct a weekly investigation into the charges of the year.
Ford told the Senate court committee that it is absolutely certain that the high school party surrounded Kavanaugh and tried to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh falsely testifying that he was absolutely true that it was not.
On Friday, Nielsen reported that there might be more than 20.4 million people watching the broadcast.
The company calculated the average number of viewers who watched the broadcast through CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available to other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some difficulties with the number of people watching television in offices.
In order to explain more clearly, it is an audience of the same size as it would be during the distinctive football matches or Oscar prizes.
Nielsen reported that Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported Kavanaugh's candidacy, took the lead in all networks when the number of viewers reached an average of 5.69 million during the day-to-day trial.
The ABC, with 3.26 million viewers, was in second place.
Nielsen reported that CBS had reached 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, CNN 2.52 million.
A great deal of interest remained after the trial ended.
The main feature of the Friday drama was Flake’s.
After a small Republican Bureau issued a statement that it would vote for Kavanaugh, it was assembled at CNN and CBS Chambers on Friday morning, when the protestors called on him in an attempt to lift him to a meeting of the Court Committee.
CNN directly filmed it with the eyes cast down when it was flooded by people.
"I'm standing here opposite you," said one woman.
- Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
He was told: “You have power, so many women are helpless. ”
Flake said that his office issued a statement and, before closing the elevator, added that he would have to say more at the sitting of the Court Committee.
Later cable television and broadcasting networks were discussed directly when the Court Committee voted for the Senate's candidacy of Kavanaugh.
However, Flake said that this would only be done by knowing that the FTB would investigate the charges imposed on the candidate during the next week, whose investigation was called for by a minority of Democrats.
Flake, speaking with his friend, was partly convinced by democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After speaking with Coons and several senators, Flake’s decision was taken.
Flake’s choice was valid because it was clear that the Republicans would not have a vote to confirm Kavanaugh’s failure to carry out the investigation.
President Trump initiated an FTB investigation into suspicions against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister of Britain blames critics for "playing politics" about "Brexit"
The Prime Minister Theresa May accused the Sunday Times of leaving the critical people of the European Union "playing politics" with the future of Britain and in order to harm the national interest.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain, Theresa May, will attend the Conservatory Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In the next interview, published after her photo on the first page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called Brexit Plan, that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs, and said it was "a total absurdity".

The police arrested a person suspected of shooting at a 20-year-old LSU basketball player in Wayde’s death.
Baton Ružo Police Department reported that 20 years ago, Ditheon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned in a second-degree murder.
The officials published a video of the excitement of Sims and Simpson, and the police pointed out that Sims had left his eyes during the marches.
The "CBS" branch "WAFB" reports that the police took glasses from the scene and found Simpson DNA on them.
After questioning Simpson, the police reported that he had killed Wayde.
The lawyer informs that his release security is $350 000.
On Friday, the staff of experts from the Eastern Baton Rose Paraps issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death is a head-to-head shot.
The section is awarded to the police working group of the state of Louisiana, to the State Police Crime Laboratory, to the South University police and to the population of the region who assisted in the investigation during which the suspect was arrested.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the area for its legal protection for the "cruelness and enforcement of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
1,98 feet tall boy grew up in Baton Rus, where his father Wayne also played basketball LSU.
Last season, during the game, the young man averaged 5,6 points and won a 2,6 shock ball.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "blowing" and "shocked".
"It's always thought of," Wade said.
Firefighting in the Gulf of Mexico City
From the fire department of Popokatepetil, ash has reached the southern capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans to stay away from the fire department when there was an activation of the activity and 183 times the emissions of gas and ash recorded within 24 hours.
The center was watching a lot of horrors and horrors.
In the photos on social media, you can see a thin layer of ash covered by the front of the cars in the vicinity of Mexico, e.g. Chočimilke.
Geophysicals noted that 72 km to the morning of the city’s fire-fighting activity increased when the earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The fire department, named Don Gojo, has been active since 1994.
Prior to the vote on independence, the annual police met with Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the protestors met with the police for independence and thousands joined the opposition demonstrations in order to mention the first annual vote against Catalonia.
The group of segregated segregators was covered by eggs and powder. This caused dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually filled by tourists.
The police used the stones to stop the shells that started the day later.
Within hours, the group for independence, singing "Immortal, Unforgivable", met with Union protestors who called out, "Life Spain!"
The local press reported that fourteen people were being treated for minor injuries suffered through protests.
The year after 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal, but which is condemned by the Catalan separatists, the tension in the region of independence remains high.
Most voters decided to become independent, but, due to the majority of the votes cast, the number of voters who did not want to be separated was low.
According to the Catalan authorities, last year almost 1,000 people were injured during the violent clashes with police throughout the region in an attempt to stop the vote in the electoral district.
On Friday night, an independent group set up a camp to prevent a number of demonstrations supported by the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it was forced to change the route.
68-year-old electric Narcissus Termess said that he was no longer real about the prospect of Catalonia's independence.
"Last year we survived one of the best moments.
I watched as parents shout joyfully to the able-vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite the fact that in December last year, the regional elections have had a vital and difficult victory, the independence parties of Catalonia have been hard to maintain this year's speed when many of their most well-known leaders have retreated into volunteer alerts or have been detained and awaiting the court's role in organising a referendum and later in proclaiming independence.
According to the 42-year-old mechanic Joan Puigas, after filming a protest on his phone, the police said that the conflict had spread to politics on both sides.
"Temperature is constantly growing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriolis Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned in the pre-trial prison since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament's elections next year.
"Calling the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the repression demonstrated by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderis. Men entering the house by car
Three 33, 34, and 39 years of age were arrested after the car returned to London home.
The incident took place on Thursday at 7.30 p.m. (BVL) Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the doors and the building were damaged.
At a certain point in time, the car could also have been fired by an airplane.
The Mengos hit the Livingston win 1:0 against the Rangers.
Livingston player Dolly Menga's first bet guaranteed victory
Moving to a higher league, Livingston surprised Rangers, forcing Steven Gerrard to lose his first 18 matches with the head of the Ibrox Club.
The Dolly Mengos hit was very important because the Gary Holto team compared it to "Hibernian".
The Gerardo team will meet with the Heads of Hearts, from which they will remain eight points.
Before that, on Thursday, the European League of Rangers will play at home with Vienna's Rapid.
At the time, Livingston extended its unparalleled series of unparalleled games into a division of up to six, and the senior coach Holt has not yet felt the taste of losing, because Kenny Miller only changed last month.
"Livingston" for a chance to play games with romantic guests
Even before Holto's intruded team was to be in front of its own retrieval, causing the various problems of the Rangers.
At first, Scott Robinson crashed and knocked across the door, later Alan Lithgow was unable to reach Craig Halket's head with the ball passed over and the door was locked.
The landlords, allowing the Rangers to play in front, were not disappointed because they knew that they could cause trouble by creating standard situations.
That was the case with a decision-making effort.
Rangers passed the free strike and Livingston took the lead; Declan Gallagher and Robinson, together with their common efforts, handed over the ball to Mengai, and this man stopped it and earned a return from the centre of the fine.
Since then, the ball has been more controlled by Rangers, but the protection of the owners has been ineffective and Liam Kelly's consumer has hardly been able to work.
Such a big game went on and on the second floor, although Kelly had to work to suppress Alfredo Morelos' blow at the door.
Scott Pittman's bullet was fired by Allan McGregor, and after another standard situation, the ball was sent by Lithgow to the door.
The transmission of the ball was constantly on the scene of the Livingston penalty, but every time it was exhausted, and the two requirements for the penalty were one for meeting Halket with Glenn Middleton after the change, and the other for hitting the ball were not satisfied.
Analysis of the phenomenal appearance of Livingstone
BBC Scotland Reporter Alasdair Lamont from Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal "Livingston" game and result.
All up to one they were great and continued to exceed expectations of the ever-increasing game.
The style of the game and the staff from the return to the highest league almost didn't change, but the big prize is due to Holt, because when he arrived he set up the team.
He's had a lot of grandeurs.
It was wonderfully played by Captain Halkett, with an excellent organized defense, and Menga was worth Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall not to lose their wake.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they play well with Gerard, this time they lacked much in order to reach their level.
They had little to do with the decisive blows and only one time they had a fight against the family’s defense. A certain alarming call was made to the Rangers team in the middle of the table.
Erdogan Kelne was met in various ways
On Saturday (September 29th), there were smiles and blue skies when Turkish and German leaders met in Berlin for breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's opposing visit to Germany, when he sought to restore relations between NATO allies.
The leaders argued about issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open up a new large castle.
The largest Turkish population in the city is located outside Turkey.
The police banned 25 000 people from fighting in front of the mosque for security, but many foreigners came to see their president.
These protestors against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, also tried to be heard by condemning Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to accept it in their own country.
The various protests show the disunity of the visitors: some German Turks consider him to be a giant, while others call him a dictator.
The road crash in Deptford. The driver died in a car
In London, a driver died in a car crash.
An accident took place near Beswod and Evelyn Street, on the road to Deptford, in the morning of the city, about 10.15 a.m. BVL.
The car driver stopped, and paramedics arrived, but the man died on the spot.
Avalry happened a few months ago, after the other driver was killed on Childers Street, and the defendant was separated, and the accident occurred about 1.6 km from the accident that occurred on Saturday.
City police said officials are trying to identify the person and inform his closest relatives.
Roads are closed and bus routes change, drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartino Prison. Six officials were injured during the crash
The Prison Service reported that six prison officials were severely injured during the arrest of special security officers.
The crash took place in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Vusteršyry on Sunday around 9.30 a.m. BVL, where it continues.
Special officials of "Tornado" were deployed to manage this riot involving eight prisoners and it takes place in one prison wing.
Officials are treated from a small face injury site.
The representative of the Prison Service said: “In order to manage the ongoing incident in the HMP Long Lartin prison, specially trained prison staff were set up.
Six staff were treated for injury.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are ensuring that responsible people will be given to the police and, possibly, will spend longer time than toys."
More than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals, are held in the "HMP Long Lartin" prison.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was being treated in the hospital after he was attacked by a potassium.
In the past year, officials were sent to prison to deal with a serious accident, during which some of the workers were covered with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Finland, Las Vegas, Solt Leik Sichi with its sudden floods (it can be useful for the harsh areas)
It is not normal for the atrical depression to hit Arizona, but that is what is likely to happen next week when the hurricane Rosa with her remaining energy will fall through the desert in the south of the desert and this will result in a sudden flood risk.
The National Meteorology Service has already announced the observation of the sudden flood on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona, stretching south and east Nevada, southern California and Jutas, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Solt Leave Site.
It is expected that on Monday, while approaching the rain, Rosa will return directly to Phoenix on Tuesday.
In Finland, the National Weather Service noted that “only ten atolls maintained the status of atoll storms or atolls no longer than 322 miles [322 km] from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane not more than 64 kilometres from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre are forecast to reach a drop of 5 to 10 centimeters, while the drop rate in some areas of Arizona Mogolon Rim will reach 5 centimeters.
Other areas of the desert south-west, including the central Walls and the Great Basin, are likely to fall from 2.5 to 5 centimeters and can fall to 10 centimeters.
For people with no sudden floods, the pink rains can be a blessing because the region is suffering from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of them may be useful because the afternoons are now suffering from droughts.
According to U.S. drought monitoring centre data, a little more than 40% of Arizona suffers from very high drought, and this corresponds to the second highest category," weather.com said.
First, Hurricane Rosa travels along the coast across the California Peninsula, which belongs to Mexico.
On Sunday, Rosa, still equivalent to the hurricane category with a great wind of 137 km/h, is 619 km south of the Euchenian Peninsula (Mexico) and is moving north 19 km at an hour’s speed.
The Audra encounters colder waters in the Pacific region and is therefore serious.
So it is expected that it will reach the Mexican border with the adjectives on Monday afternoons or evenings.
The criteria in certain parts of Mexico may be significant and may pose a high risk of flooding.
"From the California peninsula to the north-west Sonor is expected to wait between 8 and 15 centimeters, but the possible thing – and up to 25 centimeters of droplets," said weather.com.
Then Roza will retreat north through Mexico as an atorrhoea storm, later on Tuesday morning, reach Arizona's border as an atorrhoea depression, and the Tuesday's late evening through Arizona will retreat south of Juta.
"The main risk expected from Rosa or her remains is a very high amount of rain on the California Peninsula, the North West Sonor and the South American Desert," the National Hurricane Centre reported.
These rains are believed to cause life - threatening sudden floods, droughts, and droughts in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsummer Norton. Catch four people suspected of attempted murder
Three teenagers and 20 years of age were detained by a suspected attempt to kill after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
A teenager was found injured in Midsummer Norton in the Excelsior terrace area, approximately 04.00 a.m. according to the BVL, Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and is now stable.
The Eivono and Somerset police reported that at night a 17-year-old, two-year-old boys and 20-year-old men were arrested in the Radstock area.
The officials contacted all persons who may have any material filmed on the mobile phone about what happened.
It is said briefly that Kavanaugh "was offended by the atrocities and anger of the party of the Democrats".
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that we would like to reject the unforgivable and insulting tactics of the Democratic Party," Tempas said in his speech in Ville, West Virginia.
In short, Kavanaugh said that during his candidacy process, he was "suffered by the démocrats of the party's rage and anger".
Kavanaugh testified on Thursday to the convention strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he had sexually assaulted her several decades ago when they were still a teenager.
Ford also testified at the court hearing on his accusations.
On Saturday, the president said that “the Americans saw on that day what Kavanaugh looked like, springing and brave.
– The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, he is a lawyer who has a reliable reputation in the field of public services," he said, as supporters of West Virginia.
The President indirectly noted the candidacy of Kavanaugh, together with the importance of the mid-election of Republican elections.
"The five weeks left for the most important elections in our lives.
I don't participate, although I really do participate," he said.
– That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
A short statement was made that the democrats were seeking to "oppose and hinder".
The Senior Assistant Head of the GOP CNN said that the first major procedural vote of the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place no later than Friday.
The number of deaths from earthquakes and tsunamis caused by Indonesia continues to rise
The authorities reported that at least 384 people were killed, many were killed because of the massive waves that hit the beach, when strong earthquakes and tsunamis struck the Indonesian Peninsula.
On Friday, people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu, where a six - foot - high six - foot [6 m] wave took place on the beach. Most of them were killed by a deadly cold and destroyed everything that happened on the road.
After the tsunami, an earthquake of 7.5 degrees occurred.
“When the tsunami threat came to light yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not run away immediately, so they became victims,” said BNPB, a representative of the Indonesian disaster reduction agency in the press at Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
“Cunamis didn’t rest alone, he pulled away cars, bars, houses, he beat everything on the ground”, said Nugroho and added that, before hitting the coast, the tsunamis opened the sea at 800 km/h.
He said that some people went into the trees to avoid the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The photos of the crash agency showed that a large number of buildings and shops were destroyed, the bridges were maintained and broken, and the pond was surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the city continued to be struck again.
The series of earthquakes was felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) reported that the energy released at the time of a particularly strong earthquake on Friday was about 200 times higher than the atomic bomb, which was put on Hiroshima during World War II.
It was reported that the tsunamis could have been strengthened because of the city’s geographical location, as it lay at the end of a long, narrow valley.
Nugroho described the damage as "great" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been destroyed.
He said that some of the bodies of the victims had been found in the ruins of the buildings, later added that 540 people were injured, and 29 people died without knowledge.
Nugroho said that the number and damage of the victims may be greater along the coast, located 300 km north of Palu, in the area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
It was said that the communications networks were “completely paralyzed, so no information was received” from Dongal.
"There are more than 300,000 people living," said the representative of the Red Cross, adding that workers and volunteers go to disaster-affected areas.
It has been said that "this can already be seen as a tragedy, but the situation can be even worse."
On Saturday, the agency was highly criticised for not reporting that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said that the waves had brought a warning.
In the general social media favourite, a man standing on the top floor of the building who keeps calling for a closer tsunami to the people on the lower street.
Within a few minutes the edge of the beach breaks down the water wall, draining buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the filmed material.
As a result of the earthquake and tsunami, the supply of electricity has been decommissioned around Pala, and it has been difficult for the authorities to coordinate the provision of aid.
The authorities reported that an army from Jakarta and other cities began to send cargo aircraft with aid supplies, but evacuated persons still need food and other necessary supplies.
The city airport was reopened only to provide aid and will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit Palu's evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
Doseba reported that when World Vision staff from Dongal took a safe trip to the city of Palu, where the workers were looking at the dirty camps built in the offices.
"They told me I saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when the relief teams began taking difficult action to provide relief in the disaster, some people complained that those with a lot of experience in foreign aid had been banned from travelling to Paul.
According to the Indonesian regulations, funding, provision and personnel employed abroad can only help when the disaster is announced in the national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a province-level disaster,” said the Indonesian Red Cross representative for the press Aulia Arriani.
– When the government says, “Yes, this is a national disaster”, we can call for international aid, but such status has not yet been announced.”
The second night after the earthquake of Friday and the tsunami of Palu, close friends and relatives hoped that their loved ones would become part of a miracle that would affect the nebula of the history of distress.
A small boy was taken out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been depressed for two days by her mother’s body.
The national team of Indonesian paraspars sports coach Gendon Subdono was trained by two great Asian parasparinists who ended up in Indonesia earlier this month.
Other of the guests at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandad, were his students.
"When I'm older in parasparnia sports, I carry my emotional burden," he said.
Gendona told us in detail how in a few hours after announced about Roa Roa's hotel crash, this knowledge took place after the parasparnia sports community. He volunteered to send messages using the WhatsApp programme, to the Palu competitors who participated in the beach festival.
However, his message contained only one grey, not two blue beads.
"I think this means that the messages were not received," he said.
While filling the ATM, Newport on the Levee stole $26,750
According to a press release from the Niport Police Department, a U.S. $26,750 employee from Brink's was stolen on Friday morning at the Newport on the Levee.
"The car driver was a harmless ATM in a entertainment complex and was prepared to add more money," Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was busy, another man “run away from the back of the Brink's staff” and stole to supplement the money bag.
According to the press, the Witnesses noticed a number of suspects who ran away from the scene, but the police were unable to identify the number of persons involved.
Any person who has information about their identity should contact the Neuport police on the phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West. Reperis changed his name to Ye
Reperis Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
After publishing on Saturday about the changes in the Twitter account, he wrote: “A person formerly known as Kanye Westa”.
For 41 years, Mr. West has been called Ye and on this behalf he named the eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes began before the show "Saturday Night Live", where Westas was expected to present his new album "Yandhi".
This he has to change the singer Ariana Granda, who called off the show for "emotional reasons," said the show's creator.
This is not only a reduction in the current professional name – Mr West said earlier that this word has religious significance for him.
“I think that “ye” is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you”,” said Mr. Wests earlier this year about the title of the album with the radio leader Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, that means us.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and the smell just Ye, which means our good, evil, panic, all of it.
The album reflects more on what we are."
He's one of many famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he gave priority to the name of Love and Brotherly Love.
A former colleague of Westo JAY-Z also changed his name and used it with or without his or her great letters.
Mexican politics Andrés Manuel López Obradar (short-term AMLO) promises not to use war against civilians.
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrodaras, promised never to use military forces against civilians, when the country is approaching the 50th animal repression against students.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised at Tlatelolco "never to use military forces to disturb the Mexicans".
On October 2, 1968, at the time of the movement of the left-wing students in Latin America, military personnel in the camp shot at a peaceful demonstration, and 300 people were killed.
López Obrador made a solemn promise to support young Mexicans each month by subsidizing students and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities involve young people in criminal groups.
The US should double the funding of artificial intelligence
"As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount released for research in this field," says the investor and artificial intellectual specialist Kai-Fu Lee, working on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were received following the publication of reports by various US government authorities on artificial intelligence, even the fact that the US is not in general an official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, in the past year China presented its plan to take the lead in artificial intelligence innovations by 2030.
"The enhanced research budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are more advanced than the US and are expected in the field of other breakthroughs in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
Double funding could double the likelihood that another major achievement of artificial intelligence will be the US, as Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "Sinovation Ventures" was released this month by the Director General of "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", who invested in one of China's most prominent intellectual companies "Face++".
In the 1990s, he worked with an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University, which won the U.S. top-ranking player Othello, and later was head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee acknowledged the previous US government technology competitions, such as the Robotik challenge of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research projects, and asked when there would be another to help find more intelligent people.
Lee said U.S. researchers often have to work hard to win state grants.
"This is not China's occupation of academic leaders – they are companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired bright university minds to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that the changes in immigration policy can also help strengthen US efforts on artificial intelligence.
"I think that doctors working in the field of artificial intelligence should be offered green cards automatically," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published its New Generation's artificial intelligence development plan.
In addition, Lee said that the Chinese National Science Fund is financing the people of academic institutions, similar to the National Science Fund and other government organisations allocate money to US scientists, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a Joint Centre of Artificial Intelligence, designed to include partners from the industry and the academic community, and the White House announced that a Special Committee of Artificial Intelligence would be set up.
This month DARPA (the Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects) has announced about US$2 billion investment for the AI Next initiative.
NSF is currently investing in artificial intelligence research of more than $100 million a year.
However, in the coming months, nothing has been done about US legislation aimed at establishing the National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The Macedonians voted in the Sunday referendum on whether to change the name of the country as the Republic of North Macedonia, an action to resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece, which blocked its efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, in which the province of Macedonia is situated, claims that its name of the northern neighbour means claims to the territory of Greece and veto Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but the opponents told nationalists that the name change would harm the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonian Slavs.
President Gjorge Ivanova said that he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts as to whether the voter activity would reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to enter into force.
The question of the referendum on the ballot card was raised: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership in agreement with Greece?"
The sponsors of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that Macedonia, one of the countries that have broken up with Yugoslavia, is worth paying the price to join institutions such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the country's future, a young Macedonian to be able to live freely, to protect the European Union, because it means a safer life for us all," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough Members said that they would respect the results of the vote and make them decisive.
The name is to be replaced by the two-thirds majority of Parliament.
The National Electoral Commission has reported that no infringement reports have been made up to 1 p.m.
However, the voter's activity was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent during the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 percent of the vote was cast.
"I came to vote for my children, for our place in Europe," said Gjos Tanevski, the 62-year-old elector of Skopje.
Macedonian MP Zoran Zaevas, his wife Zorica and his son Duška vote in a referendum held in Macedonia on the change of country name in order to open the way to NATO and the European Union. Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
Prior to the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and pulled seats in front of the tents that were built by the boycotting referendum.
"We are behind NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up rather than enter through the service door," Kavadarkov said.
– We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can return to others, such as China and Russia, and participate in Eurasia's integration."
Prime Minister Zaevas said that NATO membership in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 per cent, would attract the necessary investments.
"I believe that the majority will be for, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are favourable to the EU and NATO," Zaevas said.
He said that the result of "Yes" would be "a guarantee of our future".
According to the survey results published by the Macedonian Research Institute last Monday, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters should participate in the referendum – less than the required voter activity.
According to another survey conducted by Macedonian TV Telma, 57% of respondents are preparing for the Sunday vote.
70 per cent of them said they would vote Yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, it must take part in a single vote of 50 per cent of voters.
If the referendum had not been reached, this would have been the first serious failure of the pro-Procurement government's policy since it took over last May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero wins the entire Brightton defense and profit margin
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling won the Brighton defense, and the Manchester City team won the 2nd victory on Saturday, playing Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's 65-minute ingestion seemed unlikely to be easy.
Argentinian attacker got the ball in the middle of the square at the start of the attack.
Before going out into the open field, he walked between the three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero surrounded four players wearing green masks.
He broke through one defender, before the British penalty scene was turned aside by a few others.
Then he turned the ball to the left where he was Sterling.
The English shooter returned the ball to Aguero in one blow from the fine ground, and this right leg hit the ball to the right side of the door network, defeating the Brighton tanker Mathew Ryan.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," the city manager Pepas Guardiola told reporters.
– We talked about him playing 55 to 60 minutes.
That's how it was.
We were lucky that he earned a fortune at that moment."
However, it was Sterling who helped the first Sky Blues to get ahead in these Primer League matches.
The revenue was earned in 29 minutes.
At the time of the attack, Aguero got his ball at the bottom of the Brighton Square.
On the left side of the square between the two opponents, he kindly transferred the ball to Leroy’s Sane.
In Sane’s direction, several spies pushed the ball forward until Sterling swooped toward the further vertebrae.
The Sky Blues shooter launched the ball at the door before even going from the edge of the square.
On Tuesday, 12 a.m., City meets with the Hoppenheim Champion League team at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Zinsheim (Germany).
Sherzer wants to play friendly games with Rockies
After the Nationals dropped out of the tenders, there was no need to force for new important reasons.
By competing with Scherzer, they hope to win Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still have the opportunity to remain in the tender competitions; in the national league "West" they run one point "Los Angeles Dodgers".
“Rockies”, score 5:2 won by “Nationals”, at least already secured the chance to get a preferential route, but will still have to try to ensure the right to play the first division.
"Although we are playing for nothing, at least we will be able to escape to the square knowing that the atmosphere in Denver, where people and other teams will meet, will probably be at the highest level we can reach this year.
Why don't you get sick?"
The team of Sunday matches of the initial composition of "Nationals" has not yet announced, but in this case they throw the ball is clearly willing to release Scherzer.
Sherzer, who will be in the building on the 34th day of the game, took the position of the artist on Thursday and took the usual day of rest for him on Sunday.
The statistics of the Washington right-hand side this season: 18-7, 2,53 ERA and 300 cars through 220 2/3 basement.
A Short Language in West Virginia
Speaking of the important activity of Republican voters in the mid-term elections, the President shall report indirectly on the situation regarding the appointment of Bretto Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
"All that we have achieved will be placed on the table in November.
Up to five weeks have passed since the most important elections in our lives.
It's very important, I'm not running... but actually running, that's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Then he went on: – You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see how this is happening right now.
And they're willing to return the government by any means, you see how low it is, how bad it is.
They don't care what they've caught up with, what they're going through to get power and control; that's what they really want, power and control, but we won't give them that."
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to "oppress and prevent".
"And you've seen it for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "poisons, horrors, earthly policing and wrong people."
He referred to the Senate Courts Committee, referring to the name of the Democratic Senator Diana’s Feinstein, which resulted in great ovations of listeners.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you delete the document?
Ø, hm, how.
No, um... no, I'm waiting for one – it was really a missing body language – the worst body language of all I've ever seen."
The Lebanese have lost a variety of opinions.
They do not tolerate those who openly express their opinion
When Momentum activists in my local party voted for my lack of confidence, I said that there was a need to monitor it.
Finally, I am the latest of the Lebanese parliamentarians who have been told that I am unwelcome, and that is for my opinion.
My fellow MP, Joan Ryan, called for similar threats because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
My lack of confidence was expressed in criticizing me for not having met Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of economic policy, for national security, for Europe, for irony, for similar issues that Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East Labour meeting said on Friday that "we want many members to be involved and that meetings are productive."
Most of the eight-year-olds, when I'm the local Parliament of the Libyan Party, the Friday evening GC meetings were exactly the same as they were.
Regrettably, today's many tons of meetings are not exactly the same and the promises of a "slower, more pleasant" policy have long been forgotten, even if they have been in general.
It is increasingly evident that another opinion is intolerable in the Lebanese party and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is accepted by the party’s management.
This began shortly after the party leader became Jeremy, and colleagues, whom, as I had previously thought, had similar political views, began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and follow the opinions I would never agree with – either on national security or on the EU single market.
As soon as I speak to the public – and even no matter what – social networks are investigating the insults that encourage my withdrawal, they condemn the policy of the centre and they tell me that I am not a place in the Leiborist party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I have achieved something more than some of my colleagues, because the comments I have made are political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who have every day to face the wave of sexist and racist insults.
One of the most disturbing things in this political era is how the insults have become a normal phenomenon.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Lebanese party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a lot of the same views, and with each 'distrust' procedure or a change in the electoral system, this party is becoming weaker.
Over the past two years, I have received much advice not to jump off, not to speak so loudly, and then “everything will be fine with me. ”
But that's not what I came for.
Since 32 years ago, when I joined the Lebanese Party as a scientist, I have been provoked by the neglect of thatcher government, which, in the real sense of that word, has damaged my entire school class, I have sought to support better public services for those for whom it is most needed – whether as a member of the local council or as a minister of the government.
I have never concealed my policies, including the recent elections.
No one in the Nottingham East had to be surprised in any way because of my political opinions and disagreement with the current leaders.
To those who have promoted this procedure on Friday, I can say that when the country gets to Brexit, from which the households, businesses and public services are affected, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Leiborist Party.
But in fact, one message I have for Notable Momentum, for my voters, for members of the Leiborist Party (or not): I am proud to be able to serve you and promise that no threats of revocation or political accuracy will stop me from acting in accordance with my beliefs and your best interests.

"Ayr"- "Melrose" – 38:17 Unaffected "Ayr" beats the tops of the tables
Two late tests failed to complete, but there is no doubt that "Ayr" deserved this triumphal moment in the impressive events that took place in the Tennent's Premiership matches.
Now the team appeared at the top of the table – the only one unaffected.
Finally, they were brought to an insurmountable defense and well-used opportunities, so coach Peter Murchie can really feel satisfied.
"We've had all the trials in all the games that have been going on so far, and we're still unbeatable, so I'm really happy," he said.
Robin Christie from Melrose said: "Ayr" turned out well, players took advantage of their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute trial, which resulted in the completion of Frazier Climo, took Air ahead, but the yellow card for Rory Hughes, who was released on the site, allowed Melrose to collect the numbers, and Baggot stopped the unsuccessful attempt.
Clima increased the advantage of Ayr when before, in the middle of the race, he earned points and successfully completed his personal test by helping Ayr before the break-up of the score 17:5.
However, the second generation of Melrose began with no trouble, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which resulted in the completion of Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
The matches were suspended for a longer time because Ruaridh Knott experienced a serious trauma and was released from the audience on the bridesmaids. Following the extension of the games, Air continued to press forward when Stafford McDowall finished his trial successfully.
"Ayr" Captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card and "Melrose" tried to take advantage of the player's surplus, but Bruce's Colvine's trial was unrelenting after he finished his free press.
The gamer of the home team returned, but, after receiving a yellow card to Struan Hutchinson for stopping Clima without a ball, MacPherson pressed the ball from the line of the fine for the remaining "Ayr" plots.
The climate resulted in the completion of its test, as had been done since almost the beginning of the competition renewal, after Kyle’s Rowe held David Armstrong’s spear at the platform and stopped the country’s attacker Gregor Henry from holding the fifth test of the house team to win points.
Still Game star, I guess, ready to start a new career in the restaurant industry
The Still Game star Ford Kiernan appears to be ready to move to the accommodation and catering services sector, which has shown that the director of the licensed restaurant company has been appointed.
A 56-year-old man in a popular BBC comedy plays Jack Jarvis, writes the scenarios and plays together with his long-standing partner Greg Hemhill.
The duate announced that the coming ninth season will be the last season of this season, and it seems that Kiernana is already planning her life after Kraiglang.
Officially, he became the Director of "Aföringmorn Limited".
The actor refused to comment on this fact, although the sources of "Scottish Sun" pointed out that Kiernana was looking for ways to get involved in the glazgo's "fascinating restaurant business".
'We belong to the sea': Bolivia is incarcerated in the ground, hoping that the court will reopen the way to the water
The sailors are patrolling the ship’s La Pase.
The flag of the watermelon is floating on public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the base of the sea is filled with a cry: “We are legally owned by the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
In all of Bolivia, imprisoned in the land, there are still vivid memories of access to the water, which we had to sacrifice to Chile in the 19th century in the bloody conflict of the resources — living and long enough to sail again in the Pacific.
In recent decades, the hopes of the people have been greatly strengthened, as after five years of discussion, Bolivia is awaiting the International Court of Justice decision, which will be published on 1 October.
"Bolivia is focused on the spirit of unity and peace and, of course, is willing to wait for positive results," said Bolivia's diplomat Robert Calzadilla.
Many Bolivian citizens will monitor the publication of the TTT decision across the country on large screens, hoping that the Hague tribunal will take a positive decision on Bolivia’s complaint – Chile will be obliged to negotiate on Bolivia’s access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who is waiting for a controversial electoral struggle for re-election, is also very interested in the outcome of the Monday's decision.
"We are very close to the opportunity to return to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
Some analysts, however, would like to believe that it is unlikely that the Court will take a decision in favour of Bolivia, even if it would take little change.
The United Nations authority established in the Netherlands has no power to detect Chile's territory and has indicated that it will not be able to determine the outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the TTT decision will only be published six months after the last arguments have been heard or shows that the case has not been "complicated", said Paz Zárate, expert in international law in Chile.
And even if Bolivia managed to push something, for the past four years, she could be distracted.
"This issue of access to the sea has been raised illegally by the current Bolivian administration," Zárat said.
She believes that any remnant of Chile’s good will has destroyed the battle of Morales.
Bolivia and Chile have extended the conversation for some time, but after all this discussion will be very difficult.
The country has not changed its ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltz, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, opposed the idea that a court decision was made unusually quickly.
"In the morning, Bolivia will have a unique opportunity to start new relations with Chile and end the 139-year-old disagreements for mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales is still one of the most popular Latin American presidents, and uses the sea as a political manipulation.
"Bolivia will never promise to have the right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we must agree with the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament is possible only if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho believes that his people will never return to nuclear weapons unless they can trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to keep its promises, which the leaders of the rival countries agreed to during the Singapore meeting.
His comments were made at the time when the Secretary of State, Mike`s Pompey, saw the intention to renew the established nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting with Kim Jong Unu Singapore.
Ri says that "the utopian dream" is that the continuation of sanctions and the rejection of the declaration concerning the end of the Korean war in North Korea could ever overlap.
Washington is prevented from supporting the declaration unless the Pchenjana is first committed to a credible disarmament action.
Both Kim and US President Donald Short wants to hold a second meeting.
However, the widespread skeptical opinion that the Pchenjana is not serious about rejecting the arsenal, which the country seems to see as the only guarantor of its security.
Pompey intends to visit Pchenjane next month to prepare the soil for the second meeting of Kim and Short.
The Paris fashion show was revealed that the latest trend is massive head coverings, and they will soon close the nearest fashion shop
If you want to add your flight collection or fully protect from the sun, this trend is just for you.
Designers Valentino and Thomas Browne presented a wide range of eccentricly large head coverings in their 2019 spring and summer collections, and he simply highlighted the views of the Paris fashion week in his style.
This particular non-practice aircraft was blocked this summer by the Instagram social network, and these designers presented eye-catching works on the podium.
The distinctive design of Valentino was a huge body color fly, decorated with a wide, bulwark on the edge of the monumental mane.
Other non-standard-size accessories were precious stones buried in orbs, a literal flight and even ananas — but they were not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thomas Browne also presented a collection of strange helmets – at the same time to Helovin.
Many colorful drums were filled with lips and reminded Hannibal of Lecter’s superior fashion.
One of the works looked like a member’s costume, with a tube and underwater glasses, and the other remembered the soluble ice hole.
And if you touch this huge fashion trend, don't ask.
Stylish experts hope that these big envelopes can enter the shops.
The large flights were also popularized with the La Bomba high-ends, and the two-footed northern flights were already worn by all – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cultural brand of the goods, which created extremely impractical flights that blocked all social networks, released another large piece of work on the podium – a nuclear beach bag, almost the same size as the one carrying it to wear a washing suit.
The red-plated stripe bag, decorated with rafie hooks and white leather handle, became the exclusive focus of the collection "La Riviera SS19" in the Paris fashion week.
Music designer Luke Armitage, FEMAIL, said: “I think that the next summer, the biggest flight and beach bags would be brought to stores, because the designer had such a big impact, so it would be difficult to ignore the need for non-standard accessories. ”
John Edward: "Paying talks is a very important skill for the world's citizens"
The independent schools of Scotland have improved the records of academic achievements, not to be released in 2018, and again demonstrated the outstanding results of examinations, which have only further strengthened individual and collective achievements in the fields of sport, art, music and other community merits.
When more than 30,000 students are taught throughout Scotland, this school, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), aims to provide their students and their parents with the highest level of services.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and to be citizens of the world.
Working in the education sector, which can create and implement the school programme, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and that they are collected in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you can speak with a man, he will understand you.
If you speak to him in his own language, speak to him in his heart."
It is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to confuse relationships and build trust in people from other countries.
According to the results of recent reviews this year, languages are excellent at the top of popularity and in independent schools are characterized by the best maintenance ratings.
A total of 68 percent of students learning foreign language received the highest A score.
The data collected from 74 schools that are members of SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the highest A assessment in Mandarin, 72 percent received the highest A assessment in German, and 69 percent received the highest A assessment in French, and 63 percent received the Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland have time to pay foreign languages with essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language, as a matter of choice, now in independent school programmes and elsewhere are considered as important as basic things (studies, technology, engineering and mathematics).
According to a survey carried out by the UK Employment and Capacity Commission in 2014, 17% of employers had insufficient language skills for all reasons that made it difficult for them to fill their jobs.
Thus, language skills are increasingly required for young people to prepare for their future careers.
Since employment will depend heavily on languages in the future, these skills become essential in a global world.
No matter what career a person would choose to pursue in a second language, he will be much more successful in the future than others if he has the skills that he needs throughout his life.
When you can communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person learning a language will be much more competitive.
According to a survey conducted in 2013, involving more than 4,000 UK adults, 75 percent were unable to speak in a foreign language well enough to participate in the conversation, and 15 percent were the only French language spoken in a double-digit number of people, i.e. 15 percent.
That is why it is important for children today to invest in language learning.
Learning a number of languages, especially in developing countries, will give children a better chance of meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school varies according to the language they teach.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom in view of the future of 2020, such as mandarins or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, there will always be many languages from which you can choose from an independent school with training staff and specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are prepared to create a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills they need to live in the future.
It is not surprising that in today's world business environment, languages remain a vital part of the country's future, and that is why it is also necessary to reflect on the education system.
In fact, modern languages should indeed be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this opportunity to choose, diversity and results for Scotland’s young people.
That's what we need to do.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron will start a debut on Sunday San Diego "Lakers"
There was little waiting for the fans to see LeBron James start the Los Angeles Lakers season.
"Lackers" coach Luke Walton reported that James will play in the opening of the Sunday season with Denver's "Nuggets" San Diego.
But for just a few minutes, it's not clear yet.
"This will be more than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
"Lackers" reporter Mike Trudella, on Twitter, said that James is likely to play a limited time.
Earlier this week, James was asked about plans in the Lakers team during six pre-season games.
"At this stage of my career, I no longer need a pre-season match to prepare," he said.
Short language in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Short this evening starts his campaign in Ville, West Virginia.
This was the first of five short-tongues planned next week, including stops in friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Following the approval of the suspension procedure of the candidate for the Supreme Court elected by the vote, the short term is intended to focus support in the forthcoming mid-term elections, as the Republicans have been threatened by losing control in Congress in November.
A few hours this evening will be a short speech in West Virginia and how to watch it online?
Short language in Vlinge, West Virginia, scheduled 19 hours in the morning evening, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch the short language in West Virginia on the following online version of YouTube.
It is likely that this week the theme of the Supreme Court candidate Bretto Kavanaugh will be discussed, as it has suffered a lot of tensions over the suspicions of improper sexual behaviour, when the Senate voted for the suspension of the candidate until the week until the FTB conducts the investigation.
But the main objective of this campaign is to help Republicans acquire some strength in the coming November elections.
Therefore, the representatives of the President's short campaign say that the purpose of these five meetings next week, as Reuters is announced, is to "energize volunteers and supporters, trying to defend and extend the majority of the Republicans who are held in the Senate and the House of Representatives".
"Congress control is so important in his agenda that the president will travel to as many countries as possible, because the campaign season is beginning very hot," said the representative of the short campaign, reluctant to reveal his name.
The "Viling Wesbanco" arena is scheduled to attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of Pittsberg's media", says the Western Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Shortas will visit West Virginia, the country where more than 40 percentage points were won in 2016.
A short effort is being made to help a Western Virginia candidate to the Senate, a Republican of Patrick Morrisey, who according to surveys is on the ground.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president had to come to get him to the top of the rankings,” said Simon Haederis, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, as Reuters reports.
2018 Ryder Cup Tournament: The US team has decided to go to the competitions for Sunday units.
After three personal stages on Saturday afternoon, the quarters can be just what was needed during this Ryder Cup tournament.
Such a fluctuation of success is completely invented, but players really believe it, especially in competitions like this one.
So whose side is success now?
"They started with six points, and now with four, then, hopefully, we can keep it such a success," said Jordan Spiethas, preparing for the day.
Europe, of course, is the first, has four points of force and is still waiting for twelve matches.
American enthusiasm, says Spietho, has spread out, and they are not missing it, no longer talking about the shape of Spietho and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each gathered three points out of four.
The pressure was ineffective from the beginning to the end and was irreprehensiblely leading.
In order to finish the fourth match, Thomas earned two points out of two possibilities.
His beating, having won them in the 15th duo of this ma'am, was followed by similar pitfalls that seemed to say that the end of the American team is not yet coming.
"You just have to focus and take care of your own games," Spiethas said.
Now each of these players has been played separately.
To a successful end, 18 gifts.
The only players who have collected more points for Spieth and Thomas in the last few days are Francesco Molinaris and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but wonderful couple from Europe collected four points of opportunity and can be calm.
Moliwood was the only couple who needed additional blows not only on Saturday afternoons, but also on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and Friday mornings.
Those events and the response of the audiences only confirm that they and the players who win the Sunday, and no one else will be able to achieve a popularity such as Fleetwood or Molinaru, which, after the last launch of the Le Golf National field, will have the chance to secure a European victory.
It would be good to reach both at the same time in different databases.
Although we are talking about European fame too early.
Bubba Watson and Webba Simpson played short with Sergio Garcia, a four-ball hero in the morning when he was married to Alex Noren.
An additional blow and two additional blows during the series of first nine givens caused Spain and Sweden to be in trouble, from which they could not escape.
But on Sundays, no one will get away with it.
Four cats and four cats are so interesting to watch for the interaction between couples, the advice they give and the lack of it, and the fact that the strategy can change more quickly.
Europe has played better as a team, so it has come to the end with decisive leadership, but this fourth stage has also shown that the US team has a battleship, which some, especially in the countries, have doubted.
The last day of the Ryder Cup matches Europe begins 10:6
Europe will meet on the last day of the Ryder Cup, with a major revision, following the fourth stage of the Saturday, leading against the United States result 10:6.
Inspiring Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinario's duet continued to destroy the atmosphere by winning two victories against the heavy-fighting Tiger Woods and taking the lead in the four points of Le Golf National.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, in order to preserve the trophies lost by Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the four-year-olds in the morning before the failed American side and ended the stage by 3:1.
The U.S. demonstrated more resistance in the four boys who won two cats, but failed to overcome the point-by-point force
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12-unit match to keep the trophies in their hands.
Fleetwood is the first European novelty to win four points in a row, when Molinaru and Molliwood doubled after the sensational weekend, and they are only the second couple who won four points during their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup competitions.
When Woods and Patrick Reed were involved in the four quarters, they unquestionably disturbed the faith of the lost Woods and the new American Bryson Dechambeau with an even better result of 5:4.
Woods, not so overpowered by two Saturdays, at some moments showed a high level of professionalism, but had already lost 19 and 29 in their fours, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose fell into four in the morning and returned to play with partner Henrik Stenson in four in the morning; they won 2+1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the first and third places in the world rankings.
Whatever a pleasant, mild-winding day in the southwestern part of Paris, not all went to Europe as though through butter.
Three times the winner of the Jordan Spietts and Justin Thomas set up a card for the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
Four ball cats they won an easy victory by 2:1 against John Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain, and the fourth cat defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy's result by 4:3 without a bullet in the first two teeth.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team managed to recover the four-point resuscitation in a single match, even though the Furyk side would lose its balance in order to keep the trophies.
Although two days were in the second place, the success of the week was apparent.
North Korea says it won't be armed unilaterally, without being able to trust
On Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations that the continued sanctions would enhance their distrust of the United States and that in such circumstances the country would not be able to return the nuclear weapon unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the World Organisation that in recent years North Korea has taken "significant good will measures", for example, halted nuclear tests, dismantled the nuclear test base and committed itself not to spreading nuclear weapons and nuclear technologies.
"But we did not escape the same response from the US," he lamented.
"Without any confidence in the US, we will not be able to trust our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be the first to fight unilaterally."
While Ri has heard the North Korean complaints of a phase-by-step approach to nuclear destruction that would reward North Koreans in its actions, his statement was distinguished by the fact that he did not completely reject the idea of bilateral destruction, as was the case in the past with the Pchenjana.
Ri recalled the joint statement submitted by Kim Jong Unas and Donald Shortas during the first US President and North Korean leader meeting in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim undertook to work on the Korean side-by-side disarmament, and the Short promised to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end of the Korean war from 1950 to 1953, but the United States says that the Pchenjan must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to mitigate the severe international sanctions for North Korea.
"The US requires nuclear disarmament first and increases the pressure on sanctions in order to achieve its objective by means of coercive methods, even by rejecting the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
“To think that we can be sidetracked by sanctions is the same as to follow utopian dreams for people we don’t care about.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions are improving our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second Kim and Short meeting, which the US leader in the United Nations outlined earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings of the leader of Kim and South Korea, Moon Jae-in over the past five months: "If the other country were South Korea on this nuclear disarmament issue and not the US, the issue of semi-Saharan nuclear disarmament would not have been accepted by the Korean side."
However, Ri's tone of speech has changed dramatically compared to last year when he told the UN General Assembly that, when Mr. Blogio's President Shortas called Kim a "mission of rockets", preparing a suicide mission, the direction of the North Korean missile to the United States was totally inevitable.
This year in the United Nations, which was threatening to "completely destroy" North Korea, has been proud of the courage to take steps towards disarmament, but has said that much still needs to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea meets the nuclear disarmament requirements.
On Wednesday, Trump said that there was no time schedule for this, and said that "if that is necessary for two years, three years or five months, it is no matter."
China and Russia claimed that the UN Security Council should compensate the Pchenjan for the actions taken.
However, the US Secretary of State Mike`s Pomeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council's sanctions must be firmly continued without any delay until the complete final evidence of nuclear disarmament has been carried out."
The Security Council has supported the sanctions imposed by North Korea since 2006, with a view to preventing the financing of the Pchenjan nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri U.S. General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pchenjane again next month to clean up the soil for the next meeting.
Pompeii North Korea has already visited this year three times, but the last trip was unsuccessful.
In July he left the city of Pchenjana saying that all the progress was just for North Korea to declare after a few hours that he had submitted "gangsterous demands".
North Korea, during a meeting with Moon this month, promised to dismantle the missile base and nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim said that the "appropriate measures" he sought are security guarantees he had promised in Singapore and would try to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn enough to enjoy
A new course at Harvard University this year encouraged all its students to sleep more in order to fight the growing cat culture in the studios, using caffeine and not sleeping at night
One academies found that in the world’s best university students often have no basic knowledge of how to care for themselves.
Charles Çeisler, Harvard School of Medicine Professor of Sleep Medicine and Brigam Sichi, a female hospital specialist, has prepared a course that, according to him, is the first such type of USA.
The inspiration to prepare this course visited him after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the talk, one girl came to me and said, ‘Why is this happening to me just now, in the last year of the study?’
She said that no one had told her about the importance of sleep, and I was surprised," he said "The Telegraph".
The course is offered for the first time this year. It explains to students how the most important quality sleep habits help to achieve academic and sports results, improve overall self-esteem.
Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director Paul Barreira said that the university decided to offer this course at the time when it became clear that the students had very little sleep per week.
The hourly course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section has a photo of the bedroom where students can click on coffee cup, snacks, coaches and books and thus learn about the effect of caffeine, the light effect of the lack of sleep on sports results and the importance of going to sleep routine.
In the next section, participants learned how long-term sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Student city map with interactive icons that encourage participants to think about their daily routine.
"We understand that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the consequences of health when you choose to smoke," explained Professor Cheisler.
The culture of hopelessness does not sleep overnight, says it still exists. Modern technologies and increasing pressure on students led to the problem of the growing lack of sleep.
"To ensure that he was sufficiently and qualitatively retired, students should be a secret weapon in combating stress, persecution and insecurity, he spoke, even avoiding weight gain, because the lack of sleep shifts the brain into a hunger regime, so students are always hungry."
Raymond So, 19-year-old Californian, studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler to prepare a course when last year, in his first year in Harvard, he attended one of his subjects.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to ask for a course available to the entire student city.
He wishes that the next step will be to invite all second-stage students to listen to this course before starting to visit this competitive institution.
Professor Cheisler recommended that students determine the time to go to sleep, as well as to walk, and to protect the harmful effects of blue light, which is spread by electronic devices and light diodes lighting, as they may lose your circular rhythm out of balance, so it may be difficult to sleep.
Livingston 1:0 “Rangers”: Men’s influx of Gerard’s men
"Rangers" experienced another disappointment when Dolly Mengai was able to overcome the weakened result of a 1:0 by Steven Gerard.
Ibrox hoped to win his first victory after the February triumph result 4:1 "St Johnstone", but Gary Holto's team won Gerrard the second time during the 18th match leader position and now the last team has already left eight points behind the long-run premierling leaders "Hearts".
Menga intruded after seven minutes before the break, but without inspiration the players "Rangers" did not see the outcome of the match.
"Rangers" has now fallen to the sixth place, "Livingston" has risen to the third and is left with only one intruder from "Hibernian".
And Rangers' concern is not over because it's probably a tribune butter thing that hit the head of the side judge Calumi Spencui and hurt him.
Gerrard made four changes that allowed him to pick Air and lead to the Betfred cup semi-final.
On the other hand, Holt believed the same eleven who took the point from Hearts last week, and he would be pleased to see how his well-thoughts brought together opponents in each step.
"Rangers" dominated control of the ball, but having it "Livingston" did more.
They were able to enter the second minute, when Menga was hit close to handing the ball over to Scott Pittman at Allano McGregor's door, but the safe one destroyed his chance by turning the ball away from the door.
After the far-off battle of Keaghano Jacobs' free strike, Captain Craig Halkett, but his defendant, Alan Lithgowa, asked for the country.
"Rangers" took control, but the last third of the matches were only hope, not belief in their play.
Fifteen minutes later, Alfred Morelos paid me a fine when he met Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson gave a hand to the Colombian complaint.
In the first row, Rangers managed to hit only twice, but the former holder of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was poor or excavated with Lassana Coulibally's head or soft ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's 34th minute intruder may not match the race, no one will argue that they have already earned it for their efforts.
"Rangers" and again failed to overcome Jacobs' stupid defense.
Scott Arfield did not worry when Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his own name and handed it to Menga for easy completion.
During the break, Gerrard took action to change Coulibally to Ryan Kent and that change almost immediately gave fruit when the country's security defeated Morelos, but after an impressive blow after Kelly escaped the impact.
Livingston included guests in a game that he enjoyed with the far-reaching transmissions of the Litgowo and Halket's ball.
At the end of Holto’s team was able to increase their discretion, but McGregor recovered from Jacob’s beating after Lithuania’s surrender.
After the move to the square, the player who went to the rangers, Glenn Middleton, called again at the end of the match for the fine after meeting Jacobs, but Thomson and again failed him.
German: Creator of Geigeri numerator
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, today it was 136 years ago and DAUGIAU... That day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm (Hans) Geiger was born in Germany.
Geigers has discovered a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity. The invention that later created the device is known as the Geigeri numerator.
Since then, this device has become the world's scientific hit, and later the popular cultural hit, when in the 1950s Bells of Coronado film, scientists who did not particularly remember Roy Marcus and Dale Evans:
The man: "Who the hell is this?"
Rogers: “It’s Geiger’s numerator that is used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When it closes these ears, you can actually hear how atoms work, release radioactive effects into minerals."
Evans: "Hey, that's a real shot now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, after only a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention of his name continues to live on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to develop bad cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to develop bad cells and kill them
Vaccination of the immune system to recognise bad cells – this is part of treatment
The method includes the withdrawal of immune cells from the patient and their replacement in the laboratory
Then cells can "see" proteins characterised by many forms of cancer and are re-injected
The test vaccine has produced promising results in the treatment of patients with various forms of cancer.
For one woman treated with this vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognise bad cells, ovarian cancer has been reported for more than 18 months.
The method includes the production of immune cells from the patient and their laboratory exchange, then cells can see proteins characterised by HER2 cancers and are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results allow us to believe that we have a very promising vaccine."
“HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovaries, lungs and direct intestines”, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach when the immune cells were derived from patients and learned to target cancer cells was successfully adapted to leukaemia.
Kanyeàs Westas launched a triad holding the Short, wearing a MAGA kepuriate, after his show SNL.
Well, that's not over.
After the show of Saturday Night Live, viewers praised Kanye West, who praised US President Donald Trump, for participating in the 2020 campaign.
On that evening, after performing the third song "Ghost Town", which was wearing a hat with the label "Make America Great", he continued to condemn the Democrats and expressed his support for Trump.
“I’ve had to talk to white people a few times, and they said, ‘How can you trust Little as he’s a racist?’
Well, if racism would raise my concerns, I'd be out of America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL show began with the comic scene in which Matt Damon made his way from Bretto Kavanaugh’s certificate to the Senate’s Court of Justice on the allegations of improper sexual conduct submitted by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although this was not broadcast, a filmed material with Westo's replicas into social networks was introduced by comics Chris Rock.
I don't know if Rock tried to get away from West on this record.
In addition, Westas complained to the audience that in the back of his head, he had problems.
"They were laughing at me in the back.
He said don't go there with that hat.
They're kidding me!
They said I reached the bottom," he said, "Washington Examiner."
Wests continued: “Do you want to see what the dust is? ” He asked. “The crown of his superman’s head means that you cannot tell me what to do. Do you want the world to live?
Start to love."
His statements were made at least twice in the non-conformity auditorium and SNL broadcasters seemed confused, as Variety reports. One person asked the media: “The entire study has brought about a deadly silence.”
West was invited to quickly change the singer Ariana Grande because her ex-boyfriend, Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West was a great fan of his appearance, during which he performed the song "I Love It", wearing a Perrier bottle.
He received support from the conservative leader Candace Turner of the TPUSA group, who announced in the Twitter account: “One of the bravest spirits for a man: I HAVE BENEFITED MINISTERED.”
But the conversation led by Karen Hunter in the Twitter account published a record that Westas was simply "and this is amazing".
"But I choose the NERETI person (by buying his music or clothing, or by supporting his "art"), whose beliefs are a sad ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
But we are also free," she added.
Prior to the start of the show, the Twitter player announced that he changed his name and that he is now formally known as Kanye West.
He's not the first creator to change his name, but he went the same way that did it to Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Comrade rapper Snoop Dogges originally called Snoop Lions; the music legend Prince has changed his name to a symbol and later became known as Prince.

The Star of the System of Wars Another Harington criticises a distorted view of manhood
Another Harington was named the character John Snau HBO in the fantastic HBO series of adventures about the Middle Ages of the World Wars.
But a 31 - year - old actor criticises a dog’s giant stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen often make young boys feel as if they should be tough to be respected.
Speaking on Sunday Times Culture, another said that he thought something was wrong, and raised a question about how to fight the problem of distorted manhood in #MeToo era.
Another, who recently led a 31 - year - old colleague of the “Soth Wars” star in Rose Leslie, admitted that this theme “has a strong feeling of him. ”
"I feel that I feel strongly about this topic now. Where did we make a mistake in becoming a man?" he asked.
"What do we teach grown men to face such problems?"
Another believes that, in part, this distorted manhood wave could be responsible for television, as it creates very male characters.
He continued: “Who is born again, and what is taught?
What is taught on television or on the street, so that young people are convinced that they need to have such a manhood?
I think this is one of the important issues of our time: how can we change it?
Clearly, young men and I have made a mistake somewhere."
In an interview, he also confirmed that he would not participate in any of the anti-Societal Wars or the continuations when the next summer's show ended, and said that "he already had enough fighting fields and horses".
Since November, the next film will be in the modern version of Samo Shepard True West. It's a film about filmmakers and his brother's robbery.
The actor recently revealed the best thing he's ever had to do when he was building a "Cats War" – there he met his wife Rose.
"In this series I met my wife, so in this sense the series gave me a future family and a future life," he said.
Emmy's award in the fantastic series Rose played Igrit, another character John Snow's love object.
The couple married Leslie, a family in Scotland, in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new diseases
China reports a 14% increase in HIV and AIDS infection among citizens.
According to health authorities, more than 820,000 people were infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most newly infected people were sexually transmitted, which differs from previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV infection in some parts of China is rapidly spreading due to infectious blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV has decreased almost to zero, according to representatives of the Chinese health authorities during the conference in the province of Junan.
Over time, however, HIV infection and the number of people living with AIDS increased to 100,000 in China.
The transmission of HIV by sex is a major issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China has been decriminalized in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT has spread.
As conservative values prevail in the country, 70 to 90 % of men who have sexual relations with men are ultimately married to women.
The majority of cases of infection are due to inadequate protection measures in such sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised global access to HIV medicines as one of the ways to tackle this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the workers have leaked data from the Republican Senator, condemning "dangerous lie" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, the United States Representative Maxine Waters denied the suspicion that one of her employees published personal information from three U.S. senators on Wikipedia's pages of lawmakers.
Los Angeles Democrat believed that the charges were filed by ultra-right wing experts and websites.
"Mala, mela and again evil mela," said Waters on his Twitter account.
It is reported that there were also the addresses and telephone numbers of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatcho, both from Juta, U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatcho.
The information on the Internet appeared Thursday, it was published by an unknown person from the Capitol Valley at the time of the Senate's allegations of improper sexual conduct against the candidate Brett Kavanauhui.
The missing information appeared as soon as the three senators asked Kavanaughi questions.
“Conservators’ websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, have been informed that the IP address, which identified the source of these records relating to the Waters office, has been disclosed to the Waters staff member,” is reported from the Capitol.
"These unfounded suspicions are completely false and absolute lies," continued Waters.
‘My staff member whose identity, personal information and security have been affected by these false and false suspicions is in no way responsible for the destruction of this information.
These unwarranted suspicions are completely false and absolute lies."
Water's statement quickly caught up with criticism on the Internet, as well as from the press by the former representative of the White House, Ari Flescheri.
"This denial sounds bad," wrote Flescheris.
"It says that it does not have sufficient self-reliance to be a Congressman.
If someone is accused of things that he has not done, he should not be angry.
He shouldn't fight.
He should not doubt the defendant’s motives.
He should be calm and humble."
It seems that Flescheris tried to compare Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too bad at the Thursday session.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who took part in the mid-term election campaign to change Waters, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Truth, if not a lie," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters stated that its office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these false accusations.
"We will make sure that the organizers will explain, "It has continued, "that they are legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees without exception."
A review of the comedy "John English Again Smurfs" – with Rowan Atkinson
The tradition has already become a search for Brexit in any British film. The same is true of the restoration of the "Jonis Ingleša" "Jonis Ingleša" "Jonis Ingleša" "Jonis Ingleša" in 2003, and in 2011 he returned to screens with the "Jonis ingleša" comedy.
Will this sarcastic self-satisfaction be a new option for national exports?
Whatever the case, the unqualified John English with wide eyes and rubber face has the second opportunity to rise to unparalleled truths on the surface, since the very name clearly indicates that this comedy is not intended for the cinematographic regions speaking in English.
Of course, this foolish secret agent, who, although having a claim to luxury, acquired and acquired a few of the properties of Inspector Clouseau, a little of Mr. Byno's features and his cheeklike similarity to that man, suggests that the theme of the drama "Fire Transport" was used during the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also a somewhat well-founded character about a traveling man and a secret man who caused the chaos that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial.
In this latest John's English movie, there's a couple of beautiful moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the gun, wearing a middle - aged suit and scarves, and the leather rotor fell into his cold.
The comedy Atkinson's talent is obvious, but the same humour appears to be inflated and strangely exaggerated, especially when serious film trade marks, such as 007 and "Mission impossible", also courageously inserts comedy elements.
Humor as much as it would be for children rather than adults, and I don't believe the adventures of Johnny English don't seem as clever and pure as the silent jokes of Atkinson playing Mr. Byne.
Today’s most common issue is that Britain was in serious trouble.
The cybernetic hacker successfully hacked into the very secret web of Britain's Internet of Snips and exposed the identities of all of Britain's Snips in this area, which leads to the agent's insulting – the role of Kevin Eldon is too insignificant.
This is the last drop in the Prime Minister's cup of pampastic and in the corner of a person who is already suffering from the crippling political unpopularity: Emma Thompson of Teresa May prints everything he can, but in the scenario, good material is little.
Wise advisers inform her that the identity of all her agents has been revealed and that she will have to look for people among those who have gone to retirement.
This means you'll have to go to John English himself, the school director currently working in a studio, but providing illegal lessons like working as a secret agent. Here were some good jokes when England offered a School of Rock snooping academy.
The English is sent back to Vihihol to discuss the unusual situation and there agrees for a long time with his common Bow, again known as Ben Miller.
Bough is already married to the captain of the submarine, and Vicki Pepperdine, a high-level girl, seems to be underutilized.
Thus, Batman and Robin, who are able to intervene in all matters of His Majesty’s secret service, again take action and meet with Olga Kurylenko, a fatal beauty of Ophelija Bouletova.
A charismatic billionaire is dangerous to the Prime Minister, claiming that he can solve the problem of British computers, i.e. the evil Jason Volt, who plays Jake Lacy.
England and Bow start their watch: after preparing the players, they light up in the French restaurant, cause chaos in the delicious Volta yacht, and England starts a complete anarchy, trying to use virtual reality ears to meet Volta's interior.
All the stops were clear to keep this last series, but whatever it is nice or wild, all of this is a great reminder of children’s television.
It's very visual.
As with other films, I couldn't get rid of my mind: the UK film industry is unable to give Rowan an Atkinson a role that would really be worth his talent?
The Labour Party rejects a plan for British workers for four days a week, but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corby's Leborist Party plans to consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but to pay a fee for five days.
It is reported that the party wants the company's leaders to share savings generated by the artificial intelligence revolution (DI) by giving their employees one day off.
This would allow workers to enjoy a three-day weekend and at the same time to report the same amount of remuneration at home.
The source says that this is in line with the Party's economic agenda and plans to channel the country's development towards workers in a positive direction.
The four-day week of transition was also welcomed by the Conference of Professional Unions as a way of benefiting workers from the benefits of the changing economy.
One of the high-ranking leborist party’s sources, The Sunday Times, stated: “The review of the policy provisions is expected to be published by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the four-day week corresponds to the party's approach to economic balancing for the benefit of employees, as well as the overall strategy of the party's industry."
The Labour Party is not the first to promote this idea; the Green Party also promised a four-day campaign during 2017.
However, this thought is currently not supported by the entire Lebanese party.
The representative of the Leiborist Party said: "The weekend of working days is not a party's policy and it is not considered in the party."
The shadow government representative, John McDonnelllis, took advantage of the opportunity to present his vision of the socialist revolution economy at the Leborist Party conference last week.
Mr McDonnelllis said he was willing to withdraw the government from the "undeclared dictators" and "deserved hunters" community services.
Such shadow chancellor plans also mean that current water company shareholders may not recover all of their share because, in view of the theft done, the Lebanese government can read something.
It also approved plans to include employees in the company board and to create ownership funds to transfer the capital of 10 per cent of the private sector enterprises to employees and they could receive up to GBP 500 annual dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answered the question "60 Minutes" whether an FTB study on B. Kavanaugh could change their opinion.
At least one final vote was postponed for a week during an investigation by Judge Brett Kavanaughi to the Federal Court of Justice, so the question arises whether the facts to explain to the Bureau of Investigation could affect the opinion of any Republican senators in such a way as to prevent them from receiving this judge.
In an interview on Sunday evening, the 60-minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asks Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether it can happen so that the FTB will figure out something that will change their opinion.
You see, Senator Kennedy has a more liberal attitude than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Well, yes, of course," says J. Kennedy.
“As I said at the meeting, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
When this happened, when the charges came up, I called him and asked, “Did you do that? ”
He answered strongly, firmly, unintelligiblely."
So Mr Graham's opinion would not change anything.
"I have decided on Bretto Kavanaugh, the charges should be serious," he says.
"Because of Dr Ford – I don’t know what was there, but I know one thing: Brettas is categorically negative," added Mr Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
‘No one named it can confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anyone's going to find out."
What is the World Citizens' Festival and how has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, the World Citizens' Festival will be held in New York, an annual music event featuring an impressive number of stars and aiming at a least impressive goal of eradicating poverty in the world.
For the past seven years, the World Citizens' Festival of Central Park will meet tens of thousands of people who will not only listen to the stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendess, but will learn more about the real purpose of the event by 2030 to eliminate a particularly high poverty.
The World Citizens' Festival was launched in 2012. It will continue the World Fight against Poverty project – an international mediation group that wants to eliminate poverty by actively increasing the number of people fighting it.
In order to obtain a free ticket to the event (unless you wanted to buy a paid VIP ticket), the concerters had to perform various tasks or actions, such as engaging in volunteer activities, sending an e-mail to the world leader, calling the phone or, in any other way, helping to raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
However, does the world’s citizens succeed in achieving this goal? 12 years remained until the deadline.
Is the idea to reward people for a free concert really will convince them to demand and encourage them to act? Maybe it's just another example of so-called clickivism, fictional activism, people think that you will really change the situation by signing an online petition or posting a Twitter network.
According to World Citizens' Festival organizers, since 2011, more than 19 million of their supporters have registered their actions, which promote the achievement of a wide range of objectives.
They say that, under the pressure of these actions, the world leaders have announced 37 billion US dollar-value commitments and policies that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group identified 390 commitments and declarations that the Group's actions have already paid or collected at least 10 billion US dollars.
With the group's funding, almost 649 million people around the world have already been affected.
Among some key commitments can be mentioned "The Power of Nutrition" – a partnership between investors and operators operating in the United Kingdom to "help children grow up and reveal their full potential". After awaiting more than 4,700 news from the World's Twitter citizens, she promised to give Rwanda US dollars to help solve the food shortage in the country.
"With the support of the UK governments, supporters, the governments of countries and such as you, the citizens of the world, we can achieve that social injustices such as the lack of food would become a precedent," said Ambassador Tracey Ullman to the concert held in London in April 2018.
This group also indicated that after receiving 5,000 appeals calling for improved nutrition for mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced funding for the Mityba power project, which will reach 5 million women and children.
In reply to one of the FAQs on your website, which asks, "Why do you think we can eliminate a particularly high poverty?",
The world’s citizens respond: “That is a long and difficult path — sometimes in a fight and failure.
However, like the great movements beyond human rights and against apartheid, we will win because we are all stronger together."
Janet Jackson, “The Weekend”, Shawnas Mendess, Cardi B, Janelle Monae is a group of performers attending this year’s New York event. The event is attended by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
As said by the Secretary of Home Affairs, the US can use the fleet to block Russian energy exports
"If necessary, Washington may use the fleet to hinder Russia's energy from reaching markets, as well as the Middle East markets," says US Secretary of Home Affairs Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner says.
Mr Zinke claims that Russia's participation in Syria, particularly when it acts in the invitation of a legitimate government, is a pretext based on the research of new energy markets.
"I think that Russia is moving to the Middle East because it wants to regulate the energy sector, as it does in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," said R. Zinke.
According to the officer, there are ways and means of resolving this issue.
"The United States can do this through a fleet, can ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, can run the blockade, can ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Mr Zinke said this to the participants in the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called the US "the voice of energy users".
He further compared Washington's methods with those of Russia and Iran, and noted that they are essentially equal.
"The economic alternative for Iran and Russia is to find a higher or lower balance that would change the fuel," he also spoke of Russia as a country whose entire economy depends solely on fossil fuels.
These statements have appeared to the short-term administration in the mission to increase their liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and to replace Russia on the market, which offers European consumers a much cheaper opportunity.
Therefore, officials of the short administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the wrong North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Mr Trump, has become free of Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion North Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is only an economic project.
Kremlin said that the reason why Washington opposes this project is purely economic, that is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all agree that energy cannot be a pressure instrument and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novaks spoke after a meeting with US Secretary of Energy Ricku Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position called for Germany's opposition, and it reiterated its willingness to continue this project.
The main organisation of the German industry, the German Federation of Industry (BDI), called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I do not really agree with the involvement of third countries in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempfas, Head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), following the recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the Masachuset says that in a serious debate about the possibility of raising his candidacy during the 2020 presidential election
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said that he was seriously discussing the question of presidential candidacy after the mid-term election.
During the meeting in the Masachusets of the Holocaust, E. Warren confirmed the possibility of candidates being discussed.
"The goal of women's going to Washington to manage our corrupt governments, they must also go to the highest level," she said in her essay.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider whether to participate in the presidential elections."
At a meeting in the town hall, E. Warren welcomed President Donald Trump, saying he led the country in an inappropriate direction.
"I am very afraid of how Donald Shortas treats our democracy," she said.
E. Warren openly criticises D. Trump and his proposed candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, in a Twitter message, Mr Warren said that "a study of FTB is undoubtedly required until the vote".
However, a poll published on Thursday shows that the majority of voters in the country themselves do not believe that it should not apply to the presidents in 2020.
According to a survey conducted at Safol University of Political Research and Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the voters of Massachusetts are expected to say that the senator should not participate in the elections.
Thirty-two percent support her candidacy.
The survey showed that more support was expected by former Governor Deval Patrick – 38 percent supported his candidacy and 48 percent opposed him.
The name of the representatives of the party of the D.A. in the year 2020 was discussed by former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Mr Biden says that the official decision will be taken in January, as the Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin at the Donald Trump conference on track Palino’s post-traumatic disorder
The 26 - year - old Track Palin, who served in the war service in September, spent a year in Iraq.
On Monday night, after an incident of violence in the family, he was arrested and accused.
“I see what my son is going through when he comes back to the daytime, so I understand the other families who feel the consequences of post-traumatic disorder, and some of the damage our soldiers are going back to,” she spoke to those who gathered at Donald Trump’s meeting in Tals, Oklahoma.
S. Palin called his arrest to be avoided the truth. She said that the sons and other war veterans “returned a little bit, they returned with stronger hearts, they returned in doubt, whether they would gain respect for what their fellow soldiers and lacquered, and all the other soldiers have returned to their country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Vasilo, Alaska, and was charged with violence in the family and assault against women, as well as the charges are difficult to report about violence in the family with a gun and in the presence of the unwarranted, as Dan Bennetts, a police representative of the Vasila Police Department, reports.
The 18 states and the Colombian District supports the opposition to the new asylum policy of asylum seekers
Eighteen states and the Colombian community support the legal challenge of a new US policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, 18 countries and representatives of this district submitted friendly comments to Curiae (Journal of the Court) to support the defence of asylum seekers' policy, NBC News reports.
The entire applicant's name in the Grace v. Sessions process, which the American Civil Liberties Union has launched against federal policy, is not disclosed.
She says that her partner "and his gang members" were violent against her, but on July 20th, the US officials rejected her request for asylum.
She was detained in Texas.
The judges of the countries supporting Grace described Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which many requests for asylum, such as states, are being raised by the problems of permanent gang violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. Asylum Policy has repealed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Council, which has allowed non-documented immigrants fleeing the family of violence to seek asylum.
On Friday in a report by the Attorney-General of Colombia, Karl Racine said that the new policy "is incompatible with the laws of the states, federal and international that are in force for decades".
"Federal laws require decisions on asylum applications to be taken in the light of specific facts and circumstances of the application, and this principle is in breach of such insurance," said friends in the Cuiae note.
In this observation, lawyers also claim that the policy of preventing immigrants from entering the country is detrimental to the US economy, and more likely for immigrants to engage in business and "provide the necessary services".
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions pointed out in June that immigration was no longer a matter for asylum-seekers in the family and for victims of gang violence.
"The asylum is granted to those who leave their country of residence for persecution or fear of race, religion, nation or belonging to a certain social group or political views," said Mr. Sessions in a statement on 11 June policy.
There has never been any attempt to solve all the problems (not all the serious problems) people are facing every day around the world.
Twice after increasing the number of victims of Palu, desperate for the rest of the living
The situation of the remaining living is constantly deteriorating.
"It's a very big attack," says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, recalling her baby's son being slaughtered in the city's escape centre.
“The migrants do not continue to carry more and more bodies.
There is no clean water."
It has been observed that the inhabitants return to their ruined homes, pick up heavy items in the water, try to save as much as they can.
Hundreds of people are injured, and the damaged 7.5-ball earthquake hospitals are depleting.
Some injured patients, like Dwi Haris, who have experienced back and shoulder fractures, are placed in the field near the Pale Army Hospital, which continues to be treated in patients with severe repeated injuries.
His eyes were filled with tears when he told how the five - room hotel in the high room where he had stayed with his wife and daughter felt the earthquake.
“There was no time to save others.
I think I've broken through the walls of the wall," said Dr. Harris Associated Press and added that he and his family came to the city to participate in weddings.
“I heard a voice of my wife’s help, and then I kept silent.
I don't know what happened to her and her daughters.
I hope they're healthy."
US Ambassador blames China for promoting advertising
Last week, when the official Chinese newspaper distributed four pages of advertisements in the U.S. daily, with the mutual benefit of trade between the US and China, US ambassadors accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The US President Donald Shortas mentioned last Wednesday the annex to the most expensive newspaper in the state of Iowa, Des Moines Register, and accused China of affecting the U.S. Congress elections on November 6th. China rejects such a charge.
"D. Briefly accusing Beijing of attempting to influence the U.S. elections, marks a new step-by-step strengthening of the Washington campaign aimed at putting pressure on China," the U.S. officials told the Reuters agency.
While it is common for foreign governments to distribute advertising in order to encourage trade, Beijing and Washington are currently entrapped into a growing trade war, and both countries are collecting tariffs for imports of each other.
According to Chinese and US experts, the Chinese responsible tariffs were allocated to exporters from Iowa and similar countries who supported the short-term Republican Party.
Terry Branstadas – US Ambassador to China, former long-term Governor of Iowa and one of the major agricultural exporters to China – said that Beijing had damaged US workers, farmers and business.
On Sunday, in an opinion published in the newspaper Des Moines Register, T. Branstadas stated that China "is more committed to printing propaganda in the free press."
"In spreading the propaganda, the Chinese government used the respected freedom of speech and press in America and ordered a paid advertising report "Des Moines Register," T.Brandadas wrote.
"At the same time, you will not find any opposing voices in the local Beijing press, and you will not create a real image reflecting different opinions that Chinese people may have on the Chinese economic trajectory, because the press is behind a hard line from the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
T. Branstad also added that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers had emerged from the proposal to print", but did not mention which newspaper it was.
Analytical warning: As regards the mid-term elections, Mr Kavanaugh has rejected the election of republican voters
Although many Republican leaders remain loyal to the candidate to the Supreme Court of Britt Kavanaugh, to whom even several charges of sexual harassment are made, analysts warned that this would be a negative response during the forthcoming mid-term elections, especially among women.
The emotions of the situation are very strong, and many Republicans are already officially saying that they want to vote.
Such things can't be taken away later," said Professor Grant Reeheris of the University of Siracuse School of Maksvelo on Saturday of The Hill.
Mr. Reeheris argued that the last minute's invitation by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to launch an FTB study would be enough to discourage the bad voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will remember it both tomorrow and November," according to the Washington newspaper, on Friday, the Senior Adviser of the MovementOn Group of Progressive Views, and the National Representative Karine Jean-Pierre.
On Friday morning, the protestors sang: "Lapcritis is approaching!" during the demonstration, the Senate fojj, when the Republicans in charge of the Court Committee decided to appoint Kavanaugh despite evidence from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, kzip reported "Mic".
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will strike across the border," said a political analyst, Stu Rothenberg, on the news site.
People say it was already strong, and they're right.
But it could further strengthen the positions, especially among the unresolved women's voters in the provinces and among the younger 18-29-year-old voters, who, although not in favour of the President, often simply do not vote."
Even before Mr Ford publicly gave evidence, when she presented details of the charges against the candidate for sexual harassment to the Supreme Court, analysts argued that if Republicans approve the candidate, this could lead to a deterioration.
"Republican parties have made this a big impression," said former president of the National Committee of Republicans Michael Steele at the beginning of last week, namely NBC News.
"Talking not only about the committee or the final vote, not only about whether Kavanaugh will be appointed a judge, but also about how the Republicans managed this situation and how he dealt with Ch. B. Ford," said Guy’s Director of the News Channel, "The Priority USA" – a group helping democratic elections.
However, it seems that the Americans do not yet agree on what to expect from the evidence of Mr Kavanaugh and Mr Ford, although she is waiting for a little more support.
The new survey "YouGov" shows that 41 percent would respond fully or most likely to believe in evidence by Ch.B. Ford, while 35 percent say fully or most likely to believe in B. Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that B. Kavanaugh was actually or probably was lying in giving evidence, and only 30 percent thought the same thing about Ch. B. Ford.
Called J. Flake, FTB is currently investigating the allegations made by Ch. B. Ford and at least one of the other defendants, Deborah Ramirez, reported "The Guardian".
Mr Ford has sworn to give evidence to the Senate Courts Committee last week, claiming that while Mr Kavanaugh was uninvited, she was attacked when she was 17 years old.
Mr Ramirez argues that the candidate to the Supreme Court showed her his genitals in the evening in which they attended a study at the University of Jelio at the 9th.
The author of the website plans to create a new internet to oppose Google and Facebook
World Network Designer Tims Berners-Lee is creating a new start to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary designer "Inrupt" is a company based on Bernerso-Lee's open code platform "Solid".
The Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored, as well as who and to which information is available.
In an exceptional interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee laughed at the goal of Inrupt to manage the world.
“We have to do this now,” he said about the start.
- It's a historic moment."
The program that operates on the basis of the "Solid" technology allows people to create their own online personal data store – POD.
It may include lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal or work tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would be available in one browser at the same time.
The internet store of personal data is unique in that only the user decides which and which information can be accessed.
The company calls this a person's mandate through the data.
According to Director-General John Bruce of the company, the idea of Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and the necessary skills to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company is made up of T. Berners-Lee, J. Bruce’s, IBM purchased a security platform, a number of programmers employed to work with this project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, global technology developers can create their own decentralised software using the tools provided on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not agree with Facebook or Google about the changes that would turn all business models upside down overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
On Saturday, in the Medium report, Berners-Lee writes that Inrupt "is a mission to provide a commercial energy and ecosystem that helps to protect the sustainability and quality of a new solid-based network."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet into a Web Consortium at the University of Massachusetts Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential opinion in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even working with Inrupt Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Media Consortium, the Media Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I feel a lot of optimism about this new era of the internet," said Berners-Lee.
Honored Bernard Vans — A Blessed Priest in the First World War of the Victorian Cross
A 100-year-old occasion in his hometown is honored by the only minister of the Church of England, awarded by the Victorian Cross as a fighter during World War I.
Lieutenant pastor Bernard Vannas won the award on September 29, 1918, at the time of the Belenglizo and Lucuria attack.
Regrettably, after four days of the pastors killed the sniper, he remained unaware that he had received the highest award from the British army.
During the parade in Rašden, in Nortamptonshire, the memorial stone was uncovered by two grandchildren.
One of the petitioners, Michael Vannas, said that the stone was opened at the age of 100 years since the award of the prize for the old is “wonderfully symbolic”.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, the Lieutenant General led his battalion through the Canal of Saint Kent, "twenty to a highly studied smoke, with a heavy load of state and automatic fires."
He then rushed to the line of attack and "especially gallant" led the line forward, and then one attacked the stage and struck three battlers.
Colonel Vanna was killed by the German sniper on 4 October 1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
At 72 years of age, Michael Vannas said that his grandfather’s actions were “one that will never be equal to anyone, but at the same time a very inspiring thing.”
After the parade led by the imperial youth orchestra in Brentwood, Michael and his brother, Dr. James Vanna, helped to win.
Michael Vannas said that he had great honor for participating in the parade and added: “A very large man shows the support that will be given to a large number of people. ”
MMA astrologists didn't sleep all night to see Bellator 206, but had to be satisfied with "Kialyte Pepa"
Imagine: You're not going to sleep all night to see the so-called Bellator 206, but you finally couldn't see the main vision.
There were 13 wars in San Chozé's office, of which six are on the main card and are broadcast directly in the United Kingdom all night through Channel 5.
6 hours in the morning, Ggarda Moussi and Rory MacDonald, while preparing for the fight, the UK viewers interrupted the broadcast after the film "Kyulytė Pepa".
Some observers were not impressed by what they said, for it was because of the fight until the day.
In the tweet, one patient called the change in the transmission with a child animated film "some liquefied prank."
“In accordance with the rules laid down by the authorities, such content is not appropriate at 6 o'clock in the morning, so it was necessary to activate a programme for children,” asked Bellator, Vice-President of Marketing and Communication Dave Schwartz on the subject of the broadcast.
"Yes, little Pepa."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said that in the future, efforts will be made to adjust the timetables in view of the observers in the UK.
"When I think of repetition, it seems to me that we might be able to do it," Coker said.
“But there are then 6 hours in the morning, Sunday, and we would not be able to resolve it until Sunday, during Monday.
However, we are already working on this.
Trust that after the transmission change, a number of reports have been exchanged that were not all friendly.
We tried to fix the situation, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But no, it's a matter of government.
I can promise you this won't happen again.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six – as we usually do. We wanted to give the astronauts more, but just failed.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt uneasy about his sexual orientation
The Olympic waterwalker Tom Daley says that he grew to feel inferior to others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
24 sportsman only said that he was not the same as everyone at the primary school.
For the first time in the play "Desert Island Discs" led by Lauren Laverne, he told the public about the rights of hostages because he wanted to give hope to others.
He also said that as a father, it was not so important to win Olympics.
The permanent lead of this long-term career led Kirsty Young for several months to retire from work due to the disease.
In the first L. Laverne lecture, which guests are asked to imagine that they are traveling to an uninhabited island, T. Daley said by growing feeling less than all the others because it was socially unacceptable to love both boys and girls.
He said: “Even these days, the feeling of poverty and cytonism has been a source of strength that has helped me to succeed. ”
He said he wanted to prove the existence of this value so that he would not disappoint the circumstances when they finally learned about his sexual orientation.
The winner of the two Olympic bronze medals became a high-level LGBT activist and, in the course of this year's participation in the games of the British Society, took the opportunity to invite more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He told the public that he believed that he could live openly without any consequences, so he wanted to give that hope to others.
Three times the world champion said that he was not expected to be in love with a man – the filmmaker Dustin Lance in the United States, who met him in 2013.
Mr Daley married 20-year-old Oscar Laureate last year, but he says that the age difference has never caused problems.
According to T. Delay, as long as he was so young – in his first Olympics he attended only 14 and after three years of cancer his father died – it's hard to agree with anything that would be the same age, but experienced the same height and ground.
In June, the couple became the parents of Robert Ray Blacko-Daley's son, the perspective of T. Daley, according to him, changed completely.
“If you had asked me last year, I would have said that it is important for me to win the gold medal,” he said.
– But, you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
Robis is my Olympic gold medal."
The son's name is the same as that of Uncle Robert, who died of brain cancer in the '40s in 2011.
Anton T. Daley, father didn't want to deal with death, so one of his last questions was whether to buy tickets to the 2012 London Olympics that he wanted to watch in the first row.
"I could not tell him that he would no longer live so long as he could sit in the first row," said Mr Daley.
– I took it for granted when he stopped breathing, and only then did I finally admit that he was not harmless,” said Mr. Daley.
After years, the athlete competed in the 2012 Olympics and sought bronze.
"I just knew that I had dreamed about it all my life – jumping into the water to watch local spectators in the Olympics – there is no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired the selection of the first song for the show – Heather Smalll’s "Proud", which reflected his feelings as he prepares the Olympics and still delights in smearing the skin.
"Desert Island Discs" is broadcast on Saturday at 11.15 a.m. during the summer of Britain.
Lost by Ph. Mickelson on Saturday's Ryder Cup Tournament on the floor
American Phil Mickelson will be on Sunday, because he will be participating 47 times in the Ryder Cup tournament, but in order for this not to be a failed reunion, he will need a great improvement in the form.
Ph. Mickelson, already playing for the 12th time in a two-year race, was placed on the throne by Captain Jim Furyk.
Instead of being at the former centre of action, as often was in the United States, five times the main winner spent part of the day on the support team, and the rest improved his technique on the platform in order to correct the obstacles to play.
Even when not trying very directly at career height, 48 athletes are not the ideal player at the Le Gold National slots, whose long rounds of hot grass are extremely unpleasant to the purposeless hits.
In addition, as the site itself would not be sufficiently alarming, on the ninth match that will take place on Sunday, Ph. Mickelson is playing ahead of the British outdoor tournament champion Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches this week, along with the young Tommy Fleetwood.
If the four remaining American points are able to get a good start on the approaching 12-unit match, Ph. Mickelson's mother can be absolutely determined.
Furyak expressed confidence in his player, but he probably couldn't speak differently.
“He perfectly understood the role he played today, pushed me through the back and with his hand he said he was ready to play even tomorrow,” Furykas said.
- He doesn't lack confidence in himself.
He is on the list of the most famous athletes both in the past and this week very much gave to these teams.
Maybe I didn't imagine he was playing two cats.
I figured more, but that's how it went, so we decided we'd do it.
He wants to play like everyone."
On Sunday, Ph. Mickelson will improve Nick Faldo's record and become the main player of Ryder Cup matches.
This may mark the completion of his Ryder Cup career, as well as the heights of his personal records.
Ph. Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven equals, but Furykas says his presence has brought no material benefits to the team.
"He's kind, sarcastic, conscious, he likes to laugh at people and he's a great man with whom he's happy to be in the team room," he explained.
– I think that younger players this week were also hard to deal with, it was good to look at.
It brings much more than the game."
European Captain Thomas Bjornas knows that a great deal of change can quickly come to light
Thomas Bjornas, a European team captain, knows from experience that a great deal of change in the approach to the latest Ryder Cup competitions can easily get into a difficult fight.
The Danish sportsman debuted in 1997 in Valderamo, where Captain Seve’s Ballesteroso’s team of opponents had a five-point resistance against Americans, but the finish line was only drawn just as early as the result of 141⁄2:131⁄2.
“We do not remember that we had a great deal of change in Valderamo; we had a great change in Brooklyn, where we lost, and also in Valderamo, where we won, but just so much,” said T. Bjørnas (in the picture), who observed the 2018 victory at 5:3 Friday and 10:6 at Le Golf National Square.
Then history will show me and all the team members that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow will require all the power.
Go and do everything right.
Until there are no points in the board, the game is not over.
We have the goal of trying to win this prize, so we must pursue it consistently.
I always said, I trust those 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well who is on the other – the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the appearance of his players in the complex plaza, T. Bjørnas added: “I would not like to escape in any way.
Tomorrow's gonna be a whole different hair thing.
Tomorrow will be the most important individual game – everything else.
It's great to play with your partner when it's all right, but when you're on the platform alone, trying your ability to play golf limits.
This idea needs to be introduced to players – tomorrow you will have to push everything out of your mind.
Now you're going to have to separate with your partner, and he's going to have to print everything out."
Unlike T. Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk hopes that his players will appear better individually than as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points from four.
Furyak himself experienced the two sides of the last day of surprise because he was on the winning team in Brooklyn until Europe came to a miracle of Medina and didn't value their losers."
“I remember every damn word,” he replied, asked as Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 motivated his players to prepare for the last day.
– Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you can reach the fast start – as you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When it comes to speed in one direction, the middle cats become very tense.
We formed our team accordingly and released the players in such a way that we, you know... we're trying to create some magic tomorrow."
Mr Thomas will be tasked with trying to engage in a responsible fight and meet with Rory McIlroy's top-level team, and among the Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahmas, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
"I chose these men in this order, because I think they will successfully win the whole game," said T. Bjørnas about their choice at the meeting of the units.
New arrival of the German military ship is delayed again
The latest German military fleet fleet had to start working in 2014 and replace the cold wartime military ships, but, according to local press, we will not see them until at least next year because of the ever growing systems and the high prices.
According to a military representative quoted by the newspaper Die Zeit, Rheinland-Pfalz, the main new Badeno-Viurtemberg-class frigate ship, the deployment is now delayed until the first half of 2019.
The vessel had to join the military fleet in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project had already been covered by the problems of the ship's transport.
Four Badeno-Viurtemberg class ships, which were ordered by the military fleet in 2007, will replace the Bremen class’s sensitive frigates.
They are expected to have a powerful attitude, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-shipcraft missiles and certain technologies of secrecy, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic footprints.
Another important feature is longer surveillance intervals, which could lead to the most recent frigates going far from home ports even to two years.
However, according to Die Zeit, the military fleets of the most advanced technology in the near future, which is said to have allowed Germany to direct military power to the overseas areas, which are long past when they are used.
The unsuccessful F125 frigate went to the headlines last year when the German military ship officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This is the first time a military ship returns the ship already delivered to the builder.
The reason for the return is not known, but the German press has been able to minimize some of the major software and technical defects of the equipment that the ship would have had never believed in in the military mission.
The lack of software is very important, as the Badeno-Viurtemberg class will run around 120 maritime teams – through smaller forces than in the older Bramen class frigates.
In addition, it has shown that this ship is very difficult – it reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the military fleet to introduce various improvements in the future.
It is believed that 7 000 tonnes of Rheinland-Pfalz are twice as heavy as similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
The cost of the whole project, including the training of the team, is also gradually becoming a problem.
It is said that it rose from EUR 2.2 billion to EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion).
The latest frugal challenges have become particularly significant in recent warning that the German military fleet is failing.
Earlier this year, the head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, Hans-Peter Bartels, acknowledged that the military ship is in fact "missing the proper use of ships".
The officer said that some time had passed since the old ships had already been registered, but he did not find a way to change them.
He regretted that none of the Badeno-Viurtemberg class frigates could join the military fleet.
"National Trust" Listens to the Life of a Secret Squirrel
A new study carried out in one of Scotland’s two altitudes is aimed at revealing how bats use land-based hunting.
The findings are expected to provide new knowledge of the behaviour of unique flying mammals and to provide some guidance for future nature conservation activities.
Scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will monitor these tiny bats, soprano bats, brown ears, and water-ridden Vester Roso Inverevo gardens in their research.
Special recorders will be issued at certain sites of the territory to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
Staff and volunteers of the National Health Service will also carry out mobile surveys by hand detectors.
An analysis of all audio recordings shall be carried out by the experts to determine the frequency and activity of any type of radio spectrum.
Then a map and a report of the living areas will be created to form a detailed picture of the behaviour of the entire landscape.
Rob Dewar, National Trust for Scotland (NTS), a natural protection adviser, hopes that the results will reveal what the living areas are most important to the poor and how they are used by every species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of residential area care activities, such as the creation of ponds, as well as how to best manage forest areas so that they are suitable for smallpox and other related species.
In the last century, the Scythian population in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has fallen short.
They are threatened by construction and real estate development, affecting the periphery and the destruction of residential areas.
There are also threats to wind power and lightning, as well as mosquitoes, some chemical tools used to treat building materials, as well as house-to-house hunting cats.
The scoundrels aren't really blind.
However, catching a grave during the nightly fishing helps the ears more than the eyes.
The location of the obstacles in the track shall be precisely determined by means of an artificial echolocation.
The NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land all over the country, is particularly responsible for the fraud.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out investigations, cross-checks and sometimes rescue operations .
The organization has even created the first and only reserve dedicated specifically to schizophrenia in Scotland in Damfries and Thrave in Galvia, where eight of the ten species of shizophrenia live.
David Thompson, the overseer of the department, says that the territory of the court is ideal for them.
“Threave dwarve we have a great place for pimps,” he said.
– We have old buildings, lots of brand trees and beautiful areas to live in.
However, we don't know much about poor people, so work here and elsewhere will help them to understand what they need in order to thrive."
It stresses that it is essential to check that there are no malnourished persons before the start of the territory surveillance work, as the accidental destruction of one can kill up to 400 women and young people, which can lead to the destruction of the entire local population.
It is forbidden to kill, excavator, or to disturb, or to destroy their shells.
Scotland's Shelter Fund Officer Elisabeth Ferrell urged society to contribute to the rescue of Shelter.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our cowards, and we don’t know how many local populations follow.”
Mr Ronaldo rejected the allegations of exorcism – the lawyers intend to refer the German journal to the court
Cristiano Ronaldo called the charges he was accused of using “melagens ” and said that people, using his name,“ try to get drunk. ”
His lawyers prepared a German news magazine "Der Spiegel", which printed the charges to the court.
In 2009, the Portuguese and Youth Clubs opponent was accused of taking up the American Kathryn Mayorg in Las Vegas hotel room.
On Friday, Der Spiegel reported that he had then apparently paid $375 000 to women in order to eliminate the incident.
Speaking of 142 million followers alive in Instagram, a few hours after reports of accusations, Ms. Ronaldo criticised the reports and called them "melagien".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, "megagens," was spoken five times by the Ballon d'Or Laureate looking into the camera.
– By using my name, they want to smell.
It's normal.
They want to be loud, to say my name is part of my work.
I'm a happy man, it's all right," the sportsman added, smiling.
According to Reuters, Ms Ronaldo's lawyers are prepared to refer Der Spiegel to the court for the accusations they called "an unacceptable suspicion of the public disclosure of private space matters".
Judge Christian Schertzas said that the sportsman would seek compensation for “moral damage which would correspond to the significance of this violation – something good, one of the most serious human rights violations over the past few years.”
It is claimed that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the casino and hotel apartments in Las Vegas.
According to the documents submitted to the Nevados Clarko District Court, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the sportsman’s room after the night club meeting, where he was allegedly analized.
Mr Mayorga said that after the alleged incident Ronaldo was on the road and told her that he was "99 percent good man", which was issued by the remaining "one percent" of his personality.
According to the documents, Ronaldo admitted that he had sexual relations, but he claimed to have been contractually married.
Mr Mayorga also said that she had approached the police, and her injuries were photographed in the hospital, but later she agreed not to agree in court proceedings, because "the former responsible actions" and did not care that they would be "publicly humiliated."
A 34-year-old woman claims that she is now seeking to withdraw the agreement because she continues to feel trauma to the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was a benefactor from Manchester United to Madrid's Real Club, and this summer, after signing a 100 million euro value contract, he joined the Italian giant Youth.
Brexit. United Kingdom would regret losing car manufacturers forever
According to Secretary of Business, Greg Clarko, the United Kingdom would be "an eternity of pity" if Brexito lost its world car production leader.
He added concern about the statement by the Toyota department in the United Kingdom by the BBC that, if Britain withdraws from the EU without an agreement, production in the factory of Burnaston would be temporarily suspended near Derbio.
"We need an agreement," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer claimed that the strike at the border would result in the loss of jobs without the agreement.
The factory of Burnaston, which manufactures the Toyota models Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% are exported to other countries of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain suddenly leaves the European Union at the end of the war, our factory will have to stop production," said Toyota Director-General of Burnaston Marvin Cooke.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover, also expressed concern about the withdrawal from the EU without agreement and its effects on international trade.
For example, BMW says that after the month Brexit will close its Mini factory.
According to car manufacturers, there are no major threats to the Brexit supply chain without a contract.
The Toyota production line shall operate when necessary, since the details of the cars produced by the order are delivered from the UK and from existing suppliers in the EU every 37 minutes.
If, on 29 March, the EU leaves the EU without a contract, there may be disturbances at the border; say to this industry, it may be delayed to provide details or to lack them.
Toyota said that the Derbishyr plant could not keep more than one day's supplies, so production would stop.
According to Clark, the future relationship with the EU's Theresa May Chequers plan is "prepared to avoid such border checks".
"We need a contract. We want to have the best contract that, as I say, would allow us not only to enjoy the success of today, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told the BBC Radio 4 programme "Today".
“Not only Toyota, but also the data from other car manufacturers show that it is necessary to continue to use a very successful supply chain system.”
Toyota could not say what time the production would be suspended, but warned that in view of the long-term prospects, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cost jobs.
For 24 years, Peter Tsouvallar, who worked at the Burnaston factory and at it, who was responsible for the "United" trade union meetings, said that his professional members were increasingly concerned: "I say from experience that these jobs will never be returned."
The Government's representative said: "We have proposed goals and confidence in future relations with the EU plan."
According to the White House, a short meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again
"Continuing the fight against the candidate for the Supreme Court's judges, a very important meeting of Donald Shorto with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be delayed for another week," the White House reported on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller – the latter investigates Russia's involvement in the elections, short-term assistants' relations with Russia and the possible impediment of the President to justice.
The question of whether short-term dismissal of the Deputy Attorney General, thus threatening Mueller's independence, has been running for months in Washington.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the microphone transmission for the talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the President by means of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected this report.
However, he went to the White House on Monday to hear the reports of his resignation.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations, would take place on Thursday.
A short statement was made that he did not want to forgive Rosenstein. Later the meeting was delayed so that he could not agree with the Senate Court Committee meeting, where he witnessed both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford was one of the women who were sexually charged.
On Friday, Shortas FTB reported on a week's examination of the allegations made by Kavanaugh, as well as putting the vote back at the plenary meeting of the Senate.
The brief representative of the press, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday at the Fox News Fair.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “His date is not fixed. He can happen this week, but in the light of all the events related to the Supreme Court, he may be withdrawn for another week.
But we'll see, I always like the press to report the news."
Some journalists do not agree with this statement: since September 10, Sanders has not held any press conference in the White House.
The husband, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders replied that the press conferences are rarely taking place because they do not like TV journalists looking for effects. In fact, he added: "I have to agree with the fact that they are looking for effects for viewers."
At that time, it was noted that Shorter with the pressure was more common directly.
"The President answers questions more often than any previous president," she said, and without any evidence, added: "We have reviewed this statistics."
According to Sanders, press conferences will be held, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is much better than talking to me.
We have often tried to do this and you have seen that over the past few weeks this has been done many times. Press conferences will change your direct communication with the President of the United States."
A brief response to questions is being made by leaving the White House, attending public meetings or press conferences with honored guests.
One person's press conferences are rare.
The presence of the president before journalists this week, free and sometimes strange, must have explained why.
Minister of Health of Scotland's NST staff from the EU wrote about Brexit's concerns
The Minister of Health of Scotland sent an EU letter to the NST staff expressing the country's gratitude and wish to stay after Brexit.
The Scottish Parliament member sent a letter to Jeane Freeman less than six months before leaving the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of permanent resident applications for EU citizens working in the public service sector entrusted to it.
In his letter to Freeman, he said: “The UK and the EU's withdrawal negotiations continued this autumn and are approaching the forthcoming decisions.
However, the UK Government has begun to prepare a possible scenario more quickly without a contract.
I know you're all very upset now.
That is why I wanted to repeat how I appreciate the contribution of all the workers – no matter what their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and elsewhere bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare system are useful to our patients and communities.
The school is really your house and we really want you to stay here."
Emergency surgery performed by Christion Abercrombie
On Saturday during the result 31:27 Vanderbilt Commodores team, who suffered a head injury from Tennessee State Tigers, a rapid operation by Christian Abercrombie, reported journalist Mike Ås Organ.
"Tennessee State" coach Rodas Reeds told reporters that the trauma occurred just before the break.
"He came to the side line and just snuck in there," Reed said.
Trainers and doctors at the side line Abercrombie were able to recharge the oxygen, then put it on the kidneys and sent it to the next study.
Officer Chris Harris of Tennessee State told WSMV that the operation of Abercrombie at the Vanderbilt medical centre was finished.
Harris added that "there is no information yet on the type and size of trauma", while Tennessee State tried to determine when it happened.
Officially passing the sports season, the second class of Abercrombie passed from Illinois and Tennessee State team plays the first season.
Before leaving the games, he recovered five balls on Saturday, and the total number of balls he recovered during the season reached 18.
Foreign buyers purchasing UK real estate will have to pay a significant fee
Under new similar plans, the UK real estate buyers will have to pay a higher significant fee and the additional money available will be used to assist the beneficiaries.
This step will reduce the risk of a successful Corbyn campaign for young voters
UK tax-free persons will be taxed on the outstanding tax
The Ministry of Finance hopes that it will be able to collect up to 120 million pounds a year, and will allocate them to assist the beneficiaries.
Today, Theresa May will announce that the UK is going to charge a higher rate of charge to foreign buyers who purchase real estate and the additional money received to assist the beneficiaries.
In order to ensure more affordable housing and to apply to large-income people, it is considered that this step will reduce the risk posed by the Jeremy Corbyn campaign for young voters.
The increased tax will be taxed by the UK-free persons and companies and will receive additional money to promote the government's fight against the nameless campaign.
The additional fee, paid next to the current flag tax, including two years ago, for the second or three-percent rentals of higher rates.
The Ministry of Finance expects that this step will raise up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built real estate in London is bought by non-UK residents, which makes it more difficult for buyers to do so.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time away from the country, so many rich countries and especially urban areas have become city figures.
The new strategy was presented just a few weeks ago, when Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the tax and thus helped more young people to buy the first houses.
He accused large construction companies of quickly buying land, but not using it, they support high real estate prices, and urged May to address the damage to the British housing by rejecting purchased household allowances.
Corbyna has published several proposed housing reforms, including the control of rental prices and the ban on landing without guilt.
He also wants more power to build new homes for municipal councils.
May said: “I said in my late years that as a prime minister, I would be able to return to the British dream — every new time life has to be better.
This means that we need to regulate our damaged housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create life here.
However, it is wrong that non-EU citizens and foreign-owned enterprises can also buy houses as easily as the UK's hard-working population.
Many people's dream of having a home has become almost unimplemented, and the threat of undermining is still too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish electorate"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to ever become a Scottish electoral leader.
The 42-year-old boy likes the challenge of restoring North-East, currently in the third league place and three points away from the first-place club.
After returning to Scotland's championship last season, St. Mirren moved to Stadium of Light this summer.
"As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I went to the crowd B and that's all over," Rossa told the BBC program "Scottland's Sports Sound".
“But in my childhood I grew up in Hamden Stadium with my father in view of many Scottish election competitions, and this always drew me back.
True, this opportunity will only take place if I have managed the club successfully."
Iki Rosso "Sunderland" led Dicka's lawyer, David Moyes, Sams Allardyce, Martina O'Neillas, Roy`us Keane, Guss Poets and Paulo Di Canio.
Earlier, after rejecting the Barnsley and Ipswich Town proposals, the former Alloa Athletic leader said he was not worried about starting to work after such well-known leaders in such a large club.
"Now my success will be assessed by the answer to the question "Can I return this club to the Primer League?"
According to the structure and conditions, this club certainly belongs to Primer leagues, he spoke.
"But it's not an easy task to take him down, but I'm probably just going back to the club and I think I worked here successfully."
Rosso's leadership career lasts only three years. He previously worked as a leader at the Dumbarton Club and for 15 months replaced hearts coaches.
He later helped to get back to the third division of Alloa, and the St Mirren Club, which was threatened to fall, turned the championship winners into the next season.
Rossa says she is now more satisfied than ever felt through her career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic clubs.
"This change was probably radical," he recalls the Alloa leadership.
“I sincerely believed that it was better to follow me – it is better than to play.
That sounds strange because I have followed, earned a lot, and enjoyed the happy results.
But playing can be difficult.
There are many problems that need to be overcome each week.
And now it's not easy – working stress and stress, but I feel that leadership is exactly what I need.
I've always wanted to lead, and now I do it. As I grew up, I always felt in my arms, but leadership brings the greatest satisfaction."

Studies have found that the best year is Saturday, 17.30 a.m.
The wave of summer heat increased the income of the poorer British waves, but the burden of the restaurants’ networks was even more heavy.
The figures revealed that the sale of loops and bar groups increased by 2.7 per cent, but income in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant who prepared this data, said: “In the long run, the British participation in the world’s championship has shown that July has continued to be a similar trend as in June, when the income of the bull has increased by 2.8 percent.
In June, trade in restaurants decreased by 1.8 percent, and the situation worsened in July.
The main incomes from beer and bara fruit were undoubtedly the best, and trade in them grew stronger than in restaurants.
Although not as strong as restaurant companies, the sunflower also affected the main incomes from the food supply.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
The sale of beverages in well-functioning fields and bars increased by 6.6 per cent this month and the sale of food fell by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, from the analysis of the leisure and fertility sector, says RSM: “These results continue to be visible from the end of April.
As regards food establishments, the main factors continue to be air and the impact of the most important social and sport events.
It is not surprising, then, that there is still a shortage of restaurant groups. True, not one year's sales drop of 4.8 percent will be particularly painful, as it will contribute to a low-cost pressure.
Most of the revenue from food-producing companies could not come in the worst time in the summer. Time will show if a milder August feels the temperature will give the necessary respiration."
The total sales growth in the halls and restaurants, including newly opened sites, was 2.7 per cent and reflected the slowdown in the development of networks belonging to trademarks.
The UK's guidelines for the retail, bar and restaurant sector are recognised as a tool for monitoring the sales of the "The Coffer Peak Tracker" sector to collect and analyse operational data from 47 operating groups with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds.
One of the five children has social media accounts from their parents
The study revealed that one of five children – some of them just 11 years of age – has social media accounts hidden from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that a greater number of Insta pages would be corrupted
News Strengthened Fear of Sexual Assault
Twenty percent of students said they had to show their parents a basic account
One of the five children – some at the age of 11 – is a secret social media account that hides them from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that a rapid increase in the number of Insta pages would be lost – this is a reference to the Instagram website for photo sharing.
News Strengthened Fear of Sexual Assault
Twenty percent of students claimed to use a censored core account to show their parents, but they also have hidden accounts.
One mother, who accidentally found a hidden website of her 30 - year - old daughter, found out that her teenage daughter had a hard time offering: “Get me out of here. ”
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and Independent Directors' Conference (MDK) found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-old students have two appointments, and half of those students admitted to hiding.
The MDK leader Mike âas Buchanan said: “So that so many teenagers are tempted to create virtual spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them are concerned. ”
Elidha Doyle will vote in the Scottish Sports Council
At the general annual meeting of the Management Body of the Sports Council of Scotland, Elidha Doyle was elected as a consultant.
Ian Beattie described this step as a great opportunity for sport-led people to benefit from a variety of international experience in the past decade.
"Eilida earned great respect in the whole of Scotland, the UK and the world sports community, and we are confident that its inclusion in the Council will bring great benefits to Scotland's sport," Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I want to serve as a sportsman’s voice very much, and I hope that I will really contribute and help guide sports in Scotland.”
A 200-400-metre match in 1996 in the Atlantic Games and a total of four Olympic gold medals was won by an American, now acting as a permanent BBC expert, who was unable to walk after the short-term attack.
"Twitter" he wrote: "I experienced insults a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I would succeed.
I had to work before I was expelled, but I was completely healed, I learned to walk again, and today I am doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for encouraging me."
On-line breast-feeding advertising comparing mothers with cows has generated different evaluations
The company producing pig fats has gained different views about its advertising, which compares the feeding mothers with the dairy cows.
In order to mark the product described as the world's first silent chest appearance, the beginning of the trade, the technology company Elvie has released an ironic music video-inspiring advertisement, which aims to demonstrate the freedom provided by the novel foodstuffs to the feeding mothers.
In this full caravan, four real mothers dance according to the sound record they hear, for example, the words: "Yes, I lie to myself, but no curse" and "If you haven't noticed, here is not the twins, here is my breast."
The appendix continues: “Take him away, take him away, feed him with the young child, take him away, take him away, and lie down with my beautiful ones. ”
However, the advertisement published on Facebook led to an online dispute.
The 77,000 times reviewed and several hundred comments received from viewers responded differently. Many claimed that it was seen through the fingers in the dairy industry’s horrors.
"This product is a very bad decision to promote the use of cows.
Like us, they must be pregnant and born to produce milk, only after their newborn births are taken from them a few days later," wrote one woman.
"Elvie" breast ring is invisible space in the feeding trough ("Elvie" / "Mother")
Another commented: “It is understood that it is a trauma to the mother and to the newborn.
But why not use them in advertising that presents breast-feeding for mothers whose babies are not taken from?"
Another added: “Advertising is a complete misunderstanding.”
Another commenter’s ad defense – one woman admitted that the song appeared “very difficult”.
"I think the idea is genius.
I'd buy it if I still had food.
When I stopped milking, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I accepted it as what it is.
This product is brilliant," wrote one.
Another commented: “This is a serious advertising for mothers whose milk is withdrawn (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feels like cows.
It is not intended to drink or condemn the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women discovers that all shocks with tapes are undetectable.
The idea of the campaign is based on the perception that many breast-feeding women say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie ring does not emit any sound, has no pipe or pipe and is invisible space in the feeding trough, so women can move freely, keep babies, or even leave the house when the milk is taken off.
The "Mother" partner and executive director Ana Balarin commented: "Elvie" is a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative start to trade it.
In comparison with milk cows, we wanted to draw attention to the withdrawal of milk and to all its challenges, but also to the extent possible by showing the incredible sense of freedom that will come through the new bottles.
"Elvie" was printed not for the first time.
During the London fashion week, the designer Martos Jakubowski collection of two children on the podium demonstrated using this product.
These migrant children quietly moved to the tent camp near the Texas border
The number of people crossing the border during the month has not changed substantially, but the number of children of detained migrants has increased considerably, partly because of the severe rhetoric and policies of the Short Administration made it more difficult to accommodate them with guardians.
Traditionally, most guardians themselves were immigrants without documents and were afraid that when they asked for the care of the child, they were at risk of staying in the country.
After the Federal Government announced in June that potential guardians and other adult members of their families would have to present fingerprints and these data would be shared with immigration authorities, the risk was even increased.
Last week, the chief officer of the Immigration and Customs Service, Matthew Albence, told Congress that the institution had detained several ten people who had applied for the care of adult minors.
Later, the Agency confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had not been tried before.
"Almost 80 percent of these people – their guardians or family members – live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
We will therefore continue to pursue these people," said Albence.
According to the adjudication, officials introduced new rules in order to consider cases of children. According to some children, they must appear in court within a month of detention, not within 60 days, as was customary in the past.
Many of the requests to give legal status to the lawyer on immigration matters will try to defend themselves, not by personal means, but by means of a conference video call.
Unrecognised beneficiaries will be deported quickly.
According to the report received by workers and in recent months from the system, the longer children remain detained, the more likely they are to become restless or depressed, which may lead to forced passage or attempts to escape.
The defendants claim that this raises even greater concern in large institutions such as the Tornilla branch: it increases the likelihood of a child being beaten.
They added that moving children to a tent town without giving them sufficient time to prepare them emotionally or to say good - bye to their friends can enhance the trauma they have experienced.
Syria has ordered the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In addition, when addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Validas al-Moualem invited Syrian refugees to return home, although war has been taking place in the country for eight years.
Moualem, also acting as Vice-President of the Minister, has stated that the anti-terrorism attack on Syrian territory is illegal and will be dealt with accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said.
Moualem claimed that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people had died since 2011, and millions had to leave home, the war on terrorism was almost over.
He said that Damascus would not be able to fight this holy war until we destroy both terrorist groups and any illegal foreigners in all Syrian territories.
There are approximately 2,000 United States troops in Syria, mainly training and consulting the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 land wars in a landlocked country.
Speaking about the refugee problem, Moualem said that the conditions for returning them are good, while he accused some Western countries of spreading unfounded fear that would deter refugees from returning.
"We turned to the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them return," he said.
"They are politicising what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria's recovery aid would only come when Assad and the opposition reached a political agreement and the war ended.
The UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey in the last major rebellion fortress in Idlibe has created conditions for faster political negotiations.
The Russian and Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale Russian-supported Syrian invasion of the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the terms set out in the agreement were clear. He also expressed hope that military action would be directed towards jihadists, including fighters from the Nusa front, which will be destroyed.
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, looks forward to convening the first meetings of the Committee of the Government and the Opposition Members, which would prepare a draft of the Syrian Penal Constitution and prepare for the elections.
Moualem laid down the conditions under which the Syrian Government would participate in the Committee: the work of the group must be limited to the revision of the current constitutional articles and warned not to interfere.
Why will the Short be chosen for the second term?
On the basis of such logic, in 2020, the Short would be elected unless, as many liberal observers are likely to expect, his presidency would have ended in time and scandal.
Without a doubt, this would be the most dramatic ever since the end of the presidency!

From the best broadcasting time in 2014, CNNs have increased from more than twice to 1.05 million, while MSNBC has increased from almost three times to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million best broadcasting time viewers, with an increase of 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC The Rachel Maddow Show takes the first place in cable TV rankings with even 3.5 million viewers in the main news evenings.

Of course, contrary to what is shown on television, the events that are taking place in Washington can determine the future of the Roe case against Wade, the possibility of bringing together immigrants' families and the state of the world economy.

When I contacted Fleiss this week, there were 27 degrees of heat and light on the northern coast of Kaunas, but he was inside the tunnel and, writing CNN, watched MSNBC.
He could not open the door – certainly not when Brett Kavanaughi was stationed against the Senate Courts Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was on his hair.
"I remember when we used to create those stupid shows, people said, "This is the beginning of Western civilization," said Fleiss.
"I thought that there was something like this, but it turns out they were right."

In the context of the mid-term elections in the House of Representatives, the fight against money from the environment
It is no wonder that, due to the reorganization of the congress districts, which ended with the attempt to win the same post by the two members of the House, the 17th district of Pennsylvania fell to the money.
Recently moved, Pittsberg's premier district was involved in the fight by the Democratic Member of the House of Representatives Conor Lamb – last spring he won his place during the special election in another district.
Lambas competes with another member of the House of Representatives – Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania. Most of them overlap with the new 17th.
Mapping when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided on January that the violation of the constitution of the old district had been falsified for the benefit of Republicans.
In the new round of elections in the 17th round, the financial institutions of the main parties – the Congress Committee of the Democratic Campaign (DKK) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRC) – were raised on the financial side of the campaign.
Lamba, in Pennsylvania, boasted when in the 18th Congress district, a small majority of the votes won the wide - eyed special elections held in March.
For more than a decade, Republicans took this place, and President Donald Shortas won 20 points in the district.
Politicians gave the Democrats such a advantage.
The United States considered Salvador to be punished for supporting China, but then inflamed.
The diplomats noted that the Republic of Dominica and Panama had already recognised Beijing, but did not essentially receive negative reactions from Washington.
In June 2017, Trumpas attended a warm meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela and, until the partners had run the trumpet Organization, he had a hotel in this country.
"The officials of the Department of the State of Taiwan decided to revoke the leaders of the diplomatic missions of the United States of America from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for their recent failure to recognize the decisions," said Heather Nauert, a representative of the department in the previous month's report.
However, sanctions are being considered only for Salvador, who received US$ 140 million in 2017 aid, as well as for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including the reduction of financial aid and the restrictions on visas applicable to specific persons, would have been painful for the Central American country with a high level of unemployment and murder.
During the internal meetings, North and Central American officials gave a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which had to be followed by a similar meeting last year, which was considered an important step forward in order to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
However, in mid-September, the senior administration officials made clear their wishes for the conference to take place, thus ending in essence any discussion of sanctions for Salvador.
“In order to show the importance of this meeting by the administration, the list of speakers of the conference scheduled for mid-October is now included by Vice-President Mike-Pence,” the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, without reporting any charges or fines to Washington.
The representative of the White House refused to comment to Bolton on the details of the discussion that three American officials, including two diplomats, had said, agreed to discuss internal discussions only if their anonymity was preserved.
Their accounts shall be confirmed by a close external analyst to the administration, including if his anonymity is preserved.
Learn History
The Special Adviser Robert Mueller’s report on possible short-term impediment to justice can be further elucidated: its very strong evidence is now available in public archives.
In addition, as it is said, Mueller's investigation is asking whether the short campaign has not been carried out in secret in cooperation with Russia, which is damaging to our elections.
If Congress were to move to other hands, Trump would have to assume responsibility in this institution, at the same time as he is preparing to stand before voters again, and perhaps even before the Board of Governors.
There is a lot of "if" here and I do not say that the short end is inevitable – as is the case in Europe.
We will all have to choose on both sides of the Atlantic, and these choices will determine whether the fight will continue for a long time.
In 1938, German officials were ready to translate Hitler into the Czech Republic, so it was necessary for the West to oppose him and support the Czechs in Munich.
We took and missed the opportunity to prevent a few years later for the dead.
History revolves around such essential points of effort – then an unfavourable sign of democracy is accelerated or suspended.
Now the Americans have come to a number of such essential points.
What will we do if we forgive Rod Rosenstein, Deputy Attorney General, for the fate of the person who belongs to the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein’s troubles began when this newspaper reported that last year the official proposed to register the president secretly and considered his incompatibility with these duties.
Rosenstein says the "The Times" story is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the new FTB is conducted in Bretto Kavanaucho's investigation is incomplete or incorrect or if this candidate is appointed to the Supreme Court despite the sexual coercion and false evidence?
And finally, in the mid-term elections, will we vote in favour of Congress, which will force the Short to take on responsibility?
If we do not keep these tests, democracy is threatened by a long winter.
But for the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we will keep them.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia, and she was taken to Osvenzia, the same nation regime that was once established in the homes where I lived as an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and after 60 years, I was sent to burn the candles on the table with the washing machine.
When I have such a legacy, how can I look to our future unoptimisticly?"

Graham Dorrans from Ranger's meeting with Rapid Vienna is waiting optimistically
On Thursday, Rapid Vienna will assume that if the impressive competitions with Villarreal that had been held earlier this month in Spain were to be successful before the fall, it could be in a strong position to leave the G group.
Due to the trauma of the middle player Graham Dorrans this season could only appear for the first time only in the finish of the 2:2 match with Villarreal. But he hopes that the Rangers Club can use this result as a trampline for more important goals.
"We had a good result because "Villarreal" is a great team," said a 31-year-old player.
“We started playing by believing that we could achieve something, and we ended this achievement.
At the end of the day, we might have been calmer, but in general, the competition was not bad.
They probably played the first race better, and we hit the second, and we showed what we're the best team.
There will be another important evening in the European League on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points. The game will be difficult because in the last races their result was great. But I am sure that with the support of the viewers we can advance and achieve a good result.
Last year was really hard – and what happened to my traumas, and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a good mood.
The team is good and the boys are really happy; the training is great.
I hope that now we will be able to move forward, forget the past season and play successfully."

Although the interviewers saw clearly what kind of care they would like to receive, few talked to family members about it.
Approximately half of Nationalwide respondents claimed that they were talking to their spouses about the price of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said he was talking to the kids about it.
"People want family members to take care of them, but they are not trying to talk about it," said Vice President Holly Snyder of the National Life Insurance Company.
That's what we need to start with.
Talk to your spouse and children. If you do not report your wishes in advance, you will not be prepared to take care of your family.
Please discuss with the consultant and the family where and what supervision you would like to receive, as these factors may be important to predict costs.
Invite the financial advisor. The advisor can also help to figure out how to pay these costs.
You may decide to pay these expenses for a traditional long-term care insurance certificate, mix money with life insurance certificate or insurance your assets until you have money.
Select legal documents. Prevent legal disputes when protecting legal documents.
Choose a health care authority. Choose a reliable person who will take care of your medical care and ensure that specialists will respect your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Think, too, of the authority to take care of your finances.
You should choose a reliable person who would make financial decisions for you and make sure that the accounts are paid if you become ineffective.
Do not forget the details. Imagine that your elderly parent or mother needs urgent medical attention and that he or she is being taken to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
To be prepared, write down these details in the plan.
"Not only financial matters are important. What are doctors?" asked Martin.

A person shot several times in an Ilfrac with a pneumatic gun
After spending the evening in the city, the man who left home was shot several times by a pneumatic gun.
In the mid - 1930 ’ s, Ilfrakum Oxford Grauvo, Devon, was shot at the chest, belly, and hand.
At about 02.30 a.m. in the summer, the officials described the shooting as an accidental act.
The victim was assaulted.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
"At least 384 were killed when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday," the officials said.
As a result of the destruction of the communication aid services, officials were unable to obtain any data from the regurgitation of Dongal, north of the Palus area near the 7,5th earthquake epicenter.
In the face of disaster, more than 16,000 people are evacuated from Palu.
Here are some of the most important facts about Paul and Dongal on the island of Slavès.
In 2017, about 379 800 inhabitants of Palu are located in the central capital of the province of Sulaves, located at the end of the valley on the northwestern coast of the island of Sulaves.
When the earthquake and the tsunami struck, the city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the year.
Dongala is a regent with a coast of more than 300 km (180 miles) north of the island of Sulaves.
In Regentia, about 299 200 people lived in the smaller administrative region for 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic pillars of the Central Sulawesian Province, in particular the Dongal Coast Region.
It is also important in the province for nickel mining, which is mainly concentrated on the other side of the Sulawesian coast in Moroval.
According to the Indonesian disaster reduction agency, Palu and Dongala suffered several times over the past century from tsunamis.
In 1938, the tsunami in Dongal killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, Dongal was defeated in 1996 and killed by nine people.
On the sixsomely active Pacific fires, Indonesia’s existence is constantly being shaken by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have taken place in recent years.
On 26 December 2004, a violent earthquake in the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
At the end of March 2005 and early April several strong tremors hit the western Sumatran coast.
Nearly hundreds of people died on the island of Nias.
The earthquake of 6.8 in 2006 struck the southernmost part of the Indonesian island of Java and caused a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
In 2009, the earthquake hit the area near the western capital of Summer Province of Pango.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
In 2010, the magnitude of 7,5 hit one nearby island of Mentavaya in Sumatra and caused a tsunami with up to 10 metres of waves, ravaged ten villages and killed about 300 people.
In 2016, because of the impenetrable earthquake in Acehe, Paddy Jay's regurgitation was shattered and panicked, as people remembered how everything was destroyed after the terrible earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This was not the case with the tsunami, but the collapses killed more than 100 people.
In 2018, strong quakes struck the well-known island of Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists temporarily landed on the coast.
The chief son of Sarah Palin is detained for domestic violence
As a result of the charges, Track Palin, the chief of the former Allies governor and the candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested.
The report published on Saturday by the Allies Police states that 29-year-old Palinas from Vasila (Aliaska) has been arrested for suspecting domestic violence, preventing the reporting of domestic violence and the detention of opposition.
As stated in the police report, when a known attempt was made to call the police to report suspected crimes, he picked up the phone.
As told by KTUU, Palinas returned to the pre-trial detention facility in Mat-Su and was released for a $500 security.
"Today he appeared in a court where, asked to justify himself, he claimed to be completely innocent," the network reported.
The penalty is charged with three Class A offences, which means that a fine of $250,000 can be imposed up to one year.
He is also charged with a class B violation, a day of imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palino.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a suspected attack.
The case is currently under consideration by the Aliasko Veterans Court.
This event is linked to January 2016 charges against him with domestic assault, preventing him from reporting on the crime of domestic violence and the detention of the armed forces in the absence of free movement.
His girlfriend said he broke her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin experienced the criticism of the veteran groups when harsh treatment of her son was associated with post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of people died
At least 384 people died after Friday in the tsunami that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
7.5 The earthquake caused the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks do not work. The number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place near the central Sulawesi, north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
The social media shares video recordings showing the moment of the tsunami strike.
The tsunami hit the coast when hundreds of people were gathered to the beach festival in the city of Palu.
Federal Prosecutors seek a rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York
In New York, federal prosecutors are seeking death sentences for Sayfull Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people. This is a rare sentence that has not been committed in this country for federal crimes since 1953.
On 31 October, it is suspected that 30-year-old Saipov of the Home Depot took off the truck and set up an attack on the bicycles so far by the western highway of the Earth Manhatan – driving by foot and by bicycle.
As stated in the report on the intention to seek a death penalty in the southern New York district, prosecutors to justify the death penalty will have to prove that Saipova has deliberately killed eight victims and has deliberately caused serious bodily injury.
According to the court's document, both of these defendants may close the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal High Court of Appeal announced to Saipov a 22-point conviction covering eight counts of murder related to the seizure of assets (usually in cases of organised crime by federal prosecutors) and the charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors say that the attack was well planned and preconceived, and that what Saipov did called it was a sleek, fat, and immoral.
"Because of the actions of Sayfull Habibulaevicius Saipov, members and friends of the following families were injured, injured and loved: Diego Enrique Angelio, Nicholas Cleveland, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernano Ferruchio, Hernano Diego Mendozos and Alejandro Damiano Pagnucco", the report on the intentions states.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last case in which the death penalty was imposed was examined in the South New York District decades ago.
Khalidas Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but he was finally sentenced to a life sentence in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in 1953 in the New York federal case for Julius and Ethelai Rosenberg, when they were sentenced two years ago to the Soviet Union in the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were sentenced to death on June 19, 1953, in an electric seat.
On the basis of the court documents, Zaipov, who was from Uzbekistan, did not regret his behaviour either immediately after the attack or after a few months.
According to the police, he told the researchers that he felt good about what he had done.
On the basis of the indictment, Saipov revealed to officials that he was inspired by images of the Islamic State (ISIS) that he was watching on his phone to carry out the attack.
The police reported that he also asked the hospital to reinstate the flag of the Islamic State.
He did not confess his guilt in accordance with the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the advocates of the federal state funded by Saipov, said that they were clearly disappointed by the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, not to acknowledge the guilt and to punish the living without the possibility of being released, will only prolong the trauma to all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek death sentences.
The rapporteur said that Mr Farage had to be responsible for the Brexit negotiations.
Today, through a protest at the so-called conference, Nigel Farage promised to mobilize the nation's army.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must feel Eurosceptic heat, and one of the MPs from Theresa May suggested that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Member of the Conservatories' Community Chamber Peter Bone told demonstrators in Birmingham that the UK would have already left if Brexit had been Farage.
But the difficulties that May faces in trying to unite those who have been separated by the parties have revealed the remaining issues of the EU which have joined the separate protest against Brexit in the city.
It is difficult for the Prime Minister to implement a compromise plan agreed in its Czech Republic when it is attacked by Brexit's supporters, opponents and the EU.
The Union strongly demanded that it seek to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite its adverse reactions, and force Eurosceptics and the Libyan Party to choose its package or chaos.
Boneàs, during the Leave Means Leave meeting, told Solihale that he wanted to break the Czech plan.
He claimed that Farage was to be an equivalent partner and that he was to be given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
"If he were a leader, we would have already left the EU," he said.
Members of the Velingbor Parliament added: "I am fighting for Brexit, but we must reject the Czech Plan."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We fought in World Wars, not to obey others.
We want to adopt our laws in our country."
“Bone” denied the idea that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have re-thinked and want to stay in the EU is completely false.”
Brexit removed the tower Andrea Jenkyns also participated in demonstrations and told journalists: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chekers' plan is not popular among the general public, and the opposition will not vote for it, and it is not popular among our party members and activists who are going to the streets and, most importantly, voting for us.
Answer the Chequer's plan and start listening."
In a critical report, May added: “The prime ministers kept their posts when they kept their promises."
Farage said that feeding policies should be forced to feel warm if they issue a decision adopted by the referendum in 2016.
"This is now the issue of confidence in our people and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to issue Brexit, so we're here today to tell them that we won't let them get away with it."
Turning to an enthusiastic minima, he added: "I want you to force our political class, which almost issued Brexit, to feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the army of this country, which has brought us the Brexit victory, and we will not stop until we become independent, municipal and glorious in the United Kingdom."
And the enemies of Brexit, before holding a two-hour meeting in the city center, marched through the streets of Birmingham.
After this weekend’s group was set up, the board of activists took the posters “Toires v. Brexit”.
Leborist Lord Adonis made a conservative about the security problems they experienced as a result of the party's programme for the conference.
"These people who say they can install IT systems and all the technologies needed for the Canadian plus plus option for borders without borders and free trade with Ireland," he said.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to take a serious look at the presidential elections
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said after the November elections she would seriously consider whether to participate in the presidential elections.
Boston Globe reported that the Masachusset Democrat was talking about his future meeting with the public on Saturday in Western Masachusets.
Warren, who constantly criticises President Donald Trump, participates in the November re-elections that will meet with GOP country representative Geoffu Diehlu, one of the leaders of the short campaign in Massachusetts in November 2016.
It was played that it could meet with Trump in 2020.
From that time on, when Shortas became president, the Saturday afternoon event in Hollywood was its 36th meeting with voters using the format of a public meeting with the public.
One participant asked whether she was planning to participate in the presidential elections.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and set up a subjugated government, and that must be managed by a woman.
Suspected of LSU Simso's execution
The police of Baton Ružo in Louisiana reported on Saturday that they had arrested the suspect who had been charged with shooting LSU's purse in Wayde Sims on Friday.
At the press conference at 11.00 a.m., Baton Ružo Police Department reported that a 20-year-old Ditheon Simpson was detained.
The police distributed a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify the man who was seen in it.
Twenty years ago, Samson was shot and died near the city of South University early on Friday.
According to "247sports", police chief Murphy J. Pauls reported on Saturday that Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died of injuries.
Waydea stood up for a friend and Simpson killed him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having a gun and a show in Wayde Sims.
Simpson was detained without opposition and was imprisoned in the custody of the police department of the Eastern Baton Rouge District.
198 cm of high-end course student Sims grew Baton Ruz, played 32 games last season, 10 of which started at the start of the five, spent on average in the square after 17.4 minutes, earned 5.6 points and recovered after 2.9 balls.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approached the world championship title when the team told him to give the victory to Sebastian Vetteli
When Walters Bott was on a qualifying trip to Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it immediately became clear that the instructions of the Mercedes team would be very important in the race.
The race began in the first place, and Bott began finely and, in defending his position in the first two stages, did not just remain in Hamilton’s trouble, encouraging the Vettell to attack his team’s friend.
Vettelis first entered the two open garage, left Hamilton, and he ran back into the back of the group, so it was crucial.
Mercedes entered the two open garages behind the wheel and returned to the road to Vettel, but Hamilton, after having not yet completed the operation, drove ahead when the Ferrari driver after a double manoeuvre, in order to maintain his position in the third position, accidentally released the inner side of the route.
On the day of the 21st birthday, Max Vertappen started from the end of the race, but at the end of the first race he was already on the seventh.
It was the fastest part of the race because it was going without changing the tyres to be the fastest finish, to pick up Kimi Raikkonen and finish the fourth.
At the end of 44, he entered the two open garage, but in the remaining eight wheels he was unable to increase the pace and Raikkonen’s finish line by a quarter.
“It was a difficult day for Walter because he had followed him well all weekend, and when I was asked to leave, he acted as a true gentleman.
The team worked well and looked for the first two places," said Hamilton.
It was really a dead body language.
President Donald Short, during a Saturday meeting with people, met with Senator Diane Feinstein because of the fact that this renegade has destroyed Christine Blasey Ford's letter, in which a candidate for the Supreme Court judge Bretta Kavanaugh is accused of sexual abuse.
Speaking in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention Ford's evidence to the Senate's legal committee, but said that what is happening in the Senate showed that people are unfair, unfair and unfair.
"What could have happened and actually happens in the last days of the Senate when you see anger when you see people being evil, rude, dishonest and unfair," he said.
“When you see official statements and disappearances, and then you say, ‘ Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you find out?
Do you remember her answer to the question, or did the document come out?
I really don't.
I didn't make it."
Well, wait a minute.
If we're dead... no, we're not dead," he added, seeing the senator.
Another July Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's accusations to Kavanaugh and which had been executed earlier in September, but Feinstein denied that the letter had been removed from her office.
According to The Hill, Feinstein's committee said: "I did not hide Dr Ford's accusations and her history."
"She asked to keep it secret, and I did as she asked."
However, it seems that the president did not agree with her denial, and he said during a meeting with people on Saturday evening: “You know, it was really a bad language.
It may not have happened, but it was the worst language I've ever seen in my body."
Following the election of the candidate to the judges of the Supreme Court, who had been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president said that the Democrats had used the charges for their own benefit.
‘They have decided to restore the government by any means necessary.
You see greed, impatience; they don't care what they hurt or have to move to gain power and control," another president's speech "Mediaite".
Elitic League: "Dundee Stars" 5:3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Dwyers won two prizes in a match with Dandi Club Giants
"Dundee Stars" came back for losing Belfast Giants on Friday's Elithic League and won Saturday's responsible Dandi matches with 5:3.
"Giants" soon set out in advance when Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilleer won two prizes.
Mike`s Sullivan and Jordan Cownie's was a balanced result before Dwyer took the Giants out again.
Francoi Bouchard of the Dandi team matched the result, but two of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's allies later won the victory.
Adam Keefe's men experienced the third loss of this season in the elite league, before that Friday night, Belfast turned and won Dandi Club by 2:1.
It was the fourth team meeting this season, with three previous matches winning Giants.
Two first intruders entered the fourth minute (3.35) after Kendello McFaull and after running for four more minutes, Beauvilliers doubled.
In the hard-started games, Sullivan returned the arena owners to the game by winning the score 13:10, and after Matt Marquardt's transfer, Cowniei compared the result to 15:16.
Two made sure that Giants went out at first break, and at the end of the first break, he earned his second intruder in the evening.
With quantitative adjustment, the square owners regrouped and Bouchard again compared the result 27:37.
Cownieîs and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen first match the Dandi team to move forward at the end of the second generation, and confirmed the victory by winning the fifth team's input in the middle of the last generation.
The Giants, who have already lost four last matches of five, will meet the Milton Keynes team next Friday.
The pilot died to help hundreds of passengers escape the earthquake
The Indonesian flight guide was announced by a giant when he was killed by an airplane with several hundred passengers safely up to the air.
More than 800 people have been caught, and many are considered to be the worst after Friday the stormy earthquake on the island of Sulaves.
The site continues to be worn by strong repeated underground strikes and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city.
Although his colleagues fled to rescue their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Aggang refused to leave his post at the highly fluctuating management box in Palu Mutiaros Sis Al-Jufri Airport.
He remained at his place of work to help the 6321 flight to the Batik Air aircraft, which was already on the rise so safely.
Then, thinking that the flight control tower is broken, he jumped out of it.
He died in the hospital later.
According to Australia's ABC News, Indonesia's air navigation representative Yohannes Sirate stated that his decision could save hundreds of lives.
We escorted him to a larger hospital in the city of Balikpapan, in Kalimantan.
Unfortunately, we're missing him this morning, and we won't reach Pale's battalion yet.
"It is a message to us without any pain," he added.
And the government is afraid that the number of the dead can increase to thousands, as the disaster reduction agency reports that the cities of Dangal, Sigio and Boutongo are hard to reach.
"It is believed that the number of victims will increase, because many victims are still behind bars and cannot be reached," said the agency representative Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high, the city of Palu will be destroyed. It will be held on the Sabbath of the massive court.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
At 35 years of age, Risa Kusuma’s mother, Sky News, said: “Every minute the fast cars bring the victims.
There's no clean water.
"All over the corner of the self-defense shop."
The head of the International Red Cross of Indonesia, Janis Gelfandas CNN, said: “The Red Cross of Indonesia is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we do not know what we will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but the situation can worsen."
Indonesia’s president, James Widodas, came to Palau on Sunday and asked the country’s army: “I am writing all of you to work day and night in order to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" Reported CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was struck by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that one man is a bad man when he falls into the lagoon
The flight, which ended with an aircraft crash in Micronesia’s Pacific Ocean basin, is now being conducted by an airline saying that one man is a bad man, although earlier it was said that all 47 passengers and crew members were rescued from a flying plane.
In the report, Air Niugini said that on Saturday afternoon they did not know about one traveling man.
The airlines indicated that they cooperate with local authorities, hospitals and researchers in their search.
The airlines did not respond immediately to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
The local ships helped to rescue other passengers and the crew when an aircraft tried to land at the airport of the island of Chuk.
On Friday, the officials reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airlines said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, all of which were stable.
It remains unclear what caused the accident and what was the exact outcome of the events.
Airline and U.S. Navy reported that the aircraft was landing in a lagoon without such landings.
Some Witnesses believe that the plane did not seem to be landing like this.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane fell from a very low point.
"That was very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to crash before the crash.
He said that the flight attendants were panicking and shouting, and he himself experienced a mild headache.
The U.S. Navy reported that by repairing the nearby bay, their mariners also helped to rescue the people who were caught by the ship on the coast before the plane crashing into a cave of about 30 metres.
According to Air Safety Network data, over the last two decades, Papua New Guinea has killed 111 people in aircraft accidents registered in New Guinea, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
The analyst set out the night when the woman was burned alive, the sequence of events
The prosecutor's office set out the facts available on Saturday in the case of a repeated man who was accused of having burned a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlett, U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He promised them how he used mobile phone records to connect the death of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victims to the movement of Jessica Chambers on the night of death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he received location data from a number of mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chamber's death evening, which is contrary to previous statements.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with Michael Sanford, the police went to check on Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford expressed his position and said that he had not been in his city that day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth by saying that he was on Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he was "laughing because his trucks were in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis claimed to know Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Mobile phone records show that they met each other for a week.
Rowlett said that after some time after Chambers died, Tellis removed Chambers' messages, calls and address information from his phone.
"He took her out of his life," Hale said.
It is expected that the defence of its final arguments will start on Sunday.
The judge told me that the case would be handed over to the jury later that same day.
"The High Breed": what is a conscious hippopus?
Hiphopo third wants to change the negative attitude of this genre by spreading positive messages to his music.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that the hippopus is far from the roots of political messages and draws attention to social problems.
They want to return to the source of the hippopus and repopulate the conscious hippopus.
The performers such as The Fugees and Commons recently reborn the UK in the works of Akala and Lowkey.
One more black?
New York branch gave a couple after being fired from work for a "racist" message
The New York branch of the court has given a couple for dismissal from work for discrimination after receiving the wrong message sent by the mother saying that she is "one more black".
The couple denied the racists and claimed to be "consuming".
The mother of two children Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman was surprised to learn that the new child supervisor Giselle Maurice was black when she arrived on the first working day of 2016.
"NOEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE AND ONE COUNTRIES", Mr Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in his letter.
However, she was sent twice not to her husband, but to Mr. Maurice.
On the basis of the New York Post, the ignorant Plasco-Flaxman felt uncomfortable and fired from Mr Maurice's work, saying that the former nephew, who was an African-American, had done his work badly and instead hoped to be held in the Philippines.
Mr. Maurice was paid for one working day and was sent by the Uber car.
Now Maurice has given a couple to the court demanding compensation for the remission and aims to adapt even after 350 USD a day for half a year's life and work in the client's home, to which she was initially hired even without a contract.
"I want to show them that such things cannot be done," she said on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination".
The couple turned away from the charges of racism and denied it and claimed that it was reasonable to forgive Maurice from work because they feared that she would not be able to trust her after she was injured.
“My wife sent her what she did not want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said Joel Plasca's husband, Post.
“Would you trust your children to whom you were unmandated, even though that was wrong?
Your new birth?
I don't think so."
Plascas said that his wife was pregnant just two months ago and was “in a very difficult situation”.
Are you going to judge for that?
This is not very nice behavior," added investment banking specialist.
During the trial, the media tried to condemn a couple on social networks, criticizing their behavior and logic.
New mails reveal that Paddington’s publishers are afraid that readers will not understand the spoken forest
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bondo, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to feel at another place, reading the book for the first time before it was released.
Now it is very interesting to know what we know about the enormous success of Padington."
In saying that her father, who worked with the BBC operator before finding inspiration to write a book for children about a feathered forest, would not be too late if his work had been dismissed and added that the 60th edition year after his father’s death was pleasant and at the same time sad.
Speaking of Paddington, which she describes as "a very important family member", she added that her father was quietly proud of his success.
"He was a pretty quiet man and did not like drinking," she said.
“When Paddington was like him, he felt like he had a child who had achieved something: be proud of him, though it is not your job.
I think he similarly assessed the success story of Paddington.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always gave his own bounty to Padington.
My daughter was distraught, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
When her daughter was released, she was quickly taken to the 2nd hospital in Nicos Louis Pasteur, where doctors were unable to save her life.
"Nada always called and said that the situation was really bad, that it was not expected to survive," said Ednan-Laperous.
“Then I received a call from Nada, who called to say that she had been living for two minutes and had to say goodbye to her.
And I said goodbye.
I told her: “Tashie, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Doctors gave medications that supported her heart beat slowly ended up working and removed from the body.
She died a little while ago, and it was the end of everything.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing that all this is happening.
I could not fight, fight, or cry because I was in the environment, surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it to myself."
Finally, Mr. Ednan-Laperous, now insulting his dead daughter, entered the plane along with other passengers who did not realize what a difficult trial she had to face.
"Nothing knew," she said.
“My head was turned down and tears began to rise all the time.
It's hard to explain why, but that's exactly why I felt a great pity for Nadu on the plane.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women’s open fires are designed to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women, who lost loved ones in death, try to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Wells Bridge spread the openings with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call and ask for help.
Mr. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he was depressed, and he killed 18 people.
"I don't want any father to feel like I have to feel every day," she said.
45 - year - old Davis said that her son was a very promising boss who was distributing the insulting smile.
"Everyone knew him about his smile.
They always said that his smile would brighten the room."
However, he did work before his death, for he was “in the place of darkness. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11, found his brother killed.
Mr Davis said: "I am afraid that a chain reaction may occur."
“ To make people know that there are people in the environment who can talk and talk, even if they are friends, ” wrote Dr. David.
Don't sit still, you have to talk."
Mr Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mr Davies, died of his 15 - year - old partner, Mark, who left his mother shortly after his death.
"He didn't say that he felt depressed, involved in depression and no argument," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed his attitude changed.
During Christmas, the situation was completely bad: when the children invented their gift, he did not look at them and did not respond at all."
She said that his death was a major injury to them, but they had to overcome it: “It left a void in the home.
That makes our heart feel better.
But we all have to live on and fight."

Following the start of the FTB study, Bretto Kavanaugh's future was added to the hair
I thought that if we could really get something that he asked for – a study of limited length and scope – perhaps bring in a little unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the Committee would be able to take a firm stand on the sidelines of the parties.
Why did the sponsors of Mr Kavanaugh and his Republicans not want the FTB to start the investigation?
Their opposition is only a matter of time.
Until the mid-term elections, which will take place on 6 November, only five weeks remain and, if the Republicans are expected to appear poor, their efforts to select the person to the highest court of the country will be much weaker.
George’s W. Bush called the senators in an effort to convince them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, former personal secretary of the Bush.
What will happen when the FTB submits its report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will take place.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh Senate can have 50 votes to allow Vice-President Mike to withdraw his contact and approve him to the Supreme Court.
After the government came to Kim, the number of deserters in North Korea was "reduced"
The South Korean legislator said that the number of North Korean deserters to South Korea decreased when Kim Jong-uns came into power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-segret, quoting data from the Ministry of the South Korean Union, said that 1,127 deserters were identified last year compared to 2,706 deserters in 2011.
Mr Park said that the main factors were enhanced control of the North Korean and Chinese border and increased prices of trafficking in human beings.
Pchenjan made no public comments.
Many North Korean deserters are finally offered the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally displaced.
Many fled across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers deserts to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forced to return them to their parents.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still technically fighting, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pchenjana in the centre of negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un's meeting in Singapore in June, when both agreed essentially that the Korean side would become a nuclear-weapon-free zone.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of not changing its sanctions.
"If there is no confidence in the US, we will not be able to trust our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be the first to fight unilaterally," said Mr Ri at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi, Brett Kavanaugh, is a "sister" and says that he does not deserve to serve at the Supreme Court
Chief of the Chamber of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, a candidate for the Judge of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, referred to him as "sister" and claimed that he did not deserve to serve the Supreme Court for his temperament.
Mr. Pelosi made these comments during an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival.
"I just can't imagine that if a woman did that, she would be said to be married," Mr Pelosi said in response to Mr Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's judicial committee on Thursday.
Mr Kavanaugh emotionally denied the charges of having taken sexual harassment against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were young.
During his introductory talk when talking about family and high school times, Mr. Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes unbecoming to shout or unbeknownst to him.
He also completely condemned the former Democrats in the Committee, who accused him of being "a playful and coordinated destruction of the reputation", which was not organised by the Liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi claimed that the evidence provided by Mr Kavanaugh had shown that he could not work in the Supreme Court because he had revealed his country's attitude to the Democrats.
"I think he has discredited himself with his statements and the attack by the Clinton and the Democratic Party," she said.
It was asked whether it would seek to eliminate Mr Kavanaugh, if his candidacy had been confirmed and the democratics had a majority of the votes received in the House of Representatives, Mr Pelosi objected.
“I will say so – if he lies to Congress or FTB, it is not proper to go to the Supreme Court not only, but also to the court where he works now,” said Mr Pelosi.
Mr Kavanaugh is currently the Judge of the Appellate Court of the District of Colombia.
Ms Pelosi added that she was concerned about the possible decisions of Mr Kavanaugh regarding the current health law or the case “Roe v. Wade” because he was considered a conservative lawyer.
During the approval meetings, Mr Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether to withdraw certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for us to say to asterically, side by side, as a judge: "How wonderful!" said Mr. Pelosi.
A possibility for women to use
This is a legitimate criticism: finally, months have passed and even years have come to an end, which it cannot express without tears.
"When we get drunk, we cry," after 45 years, the Panel told me.
"I don't think it's an unusual thing, do you?"
She continued: “One woman, the head of a certain company, helped me very much by saying that she was crying when she was gone, but she developed a certain method: She was angry and went to bed, and she said to the man with whom you were talking: “You may feel sorry for me because I’m crying.
I'm really mad."
And she just went on.
I thought it was genius."
Ashras is considered to be an acceptable expression of anger in part because it is essentially misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories is from one of the first work offices where men worked mostly and where I took the time to cry for unexplained anger, and then I was the oldest woman in the shed, the visiting manager, who was always a bit of adoring, and pushed me to the stairs.
"Never let them see those who are crying for you," he told me.
- They don't know you're in.
They think you're hungry, so you'll be happy to win."
Democratic Party Congressman from Colorado Patricia Schroeder worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Harts was captured by a stranger on the "Monkey Business" (aforism, which means that it is a time of ease) and withdrawn the candidacy, after deeply disappointed Mr. Schroeder decided that there was no reason why he could not apply to the president himself.
“This was not a good idea,” he said after 30 years.
– There were seven other candidates at the time, so there was no need for one more.
Someone called me "Snow with Seven Narrows."
Later, after the campaign, it was little time to collect the money, so she swore that she would not announce the candidacy until she would earn $2 million.
It was a fight.
She noticed that some supporters, offering $1,000 to men, only 250 to her.
"Do they think I'm getting discount?" she said.
Speaking in a language that announced the beginning of the formal campaign, it was so full of emotions – thanks to people, a system of disappointment, which made it very difficult to collect money and to reach voters directly, not representatives, and the anger of sexism, that the prophet.
“You should remember that I was nervous,” recalled Mr Schroeder.

I remember thinking about what's going to be in my grave's memory.

How the US and Chinese trading can be useful to Beijing
The U.S. and Chinese trade wars have been created, and although the battle has not yet ended well enough, according to experts, it can become a long-term disadvantage for Beijing.
The US President Donald Shortas gave the first warning this year of the earlier taxable main products exported from China, including solar elements, steel and aluminium.
The most pronounced opposition took place this week, when new tariffs were introduced, affecting goods worth $200 billion (150 billion), i.e. half of the goods exported to the United States will be taxed in principle.
Beijing responded to all measures in the same way, the most recent decision imposed on US goods of between five and ten percent, with a total value of $60 billion.
China has sworn to fight the US tooth for tooth, and it seems that this second, according to the size of the world market in the near future, does not really intend to lose weight.
Washington's sanctions would only be mitigated if China complied with the requirements, but the US's public abuse would be too tight to China's President Xi Jinpingui.
However, the experts say that if Beijing properly destroys its lot, the difficulties of the US war on trade can have a long-term positive impact on China, as it will reduce the interdependence of these markets.
"The sudden political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for which the economy of both countries is indeed much more dangerous than observers have so far been recognised," said Abigail Grace, a member of the Asia New American Security Centre.
According to the Syrian Foreign Minister, the country is ready to accept return refugees
Syria claims to be prepared for a voluntary refugee return and asks for assistance in restoring a war-torn country over the last 7 years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Validas al-Mualemas said conditions are improving in the country.
"As a result of progress in combating terrorism, the situation in the territory has become much more stable and safer," he said.
The Government continues to seek to restore the affected areas and restore the normal situation of the terrorists.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of the economic sanctions of terrorism and unilaterally directed against daily life and well-being have already been established.
From the start of the war, the United Nations has left Syria some 5.5 million cheeses.
Humanitarian aid is needed for six million people living in the country.
Al-Moualem claimed that the Syrian regime would be pleased to accept aid in restoring the country.
However, it also stressed that the country would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries supporting the rise.
Europe defeats the Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup in the Le Golf National Square near Paris, France, with a final U.S. team of 16.5:10,5.
The United States has already lost its sixth round in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in this country since 1993.
Europe returned the crown when the Danish-born Captain Thomas Bjorn team gathered 14.5 points to defeat the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had a hard time following the whole tournament, launched a hit from the starting point right into the water on the 16th of a day match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian player F. Molinari appeared in all rounds and became one of the four players who achieved the result 5-0-0 since 1979, when the tournament acquired the current form.
American Jordan Spieth 5:4 won the lowest ranking European team player Thorbjornas Olesen from Denmark.
The highest ranking in the world, Dustin Johnson 2:1 lost the English to Ian Poulter, who may have played his last tournament of the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia of the eight Ryder Cup tournaments became the most successful European player of all time, gathering 25.5 career points.
"I rarely cry, but I can't manage today.
It was not an easy year.
I am very grateful to Mrs Thomas for choosing me and believing me.
I am very happy, very happy to return the cup.
Everything depends on the team, and I am glad that I was able to help," said Mr Garcia after the European victory.
He transmits the staphyte to his father John Ramu, who in the Sunday unit game 2:1 embellished the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods.
"I was incredibly proud to defeat Tiger Woods – I grew up watching him play," Rahmas said 23 years old.
Woods lost all four of his cats in France and now belongs to him 13-21-3 Ryder Cup career record.
This changes statistics to one of the best players of all time, the winner of the 14 biggest prizes and the only one that gives Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team failed all weekend to access the driveway, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who demonstrated a high-level game during the entire tournament.
“ I’m proud of these men, they fight, ” said Captain Jim Furyak, after the depressing team.
There was a moment this morning when we started printing Europeans.
We're on foot.
I'm taking my hat to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to turn your head off.
Our opponents were better off."
