White pony at f3, black pony at e6, white pony at g4, black pony at h4 - failure and mat! This is what we call fun in the chess circles the "match of hell".
The whites: turn on a1, pony on b6, king on c8. The blacks: pony on a7 and b7, king on a8, crazy on b8. The whites put the opponent in zugzwang by playing the turn on a6, after which the blacks have only two options: take the turn on a6 or move their fire to any other case of the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the whites advance their pony from b6 to b7 and offer failure and mat. In the second situation, the whites take the black pony on a7, with the same result.
