Welsh members are worried when they look like a muppet doll.
There are concerns among some AMs about a suggestion that their name should be changed to MWPs.
This was due to a plan to change the name of Majelis to be the parliament of Welsh.
The AMs throughout the political spectrum are concerned if it can lead to disappointment.
One AM party said that his group was interested, "The name is nice with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means dirty.
A member of the council (AM) said that his group as one union, felt "unsatisfying" and had suggested some alternatives.
A conservative Welsh says that his group "open-minded" about the name change, but evaluates that this is a suggestion from the short MWP to Muppet.
In this context, the w letter in Welsh is rendered as the u letter in the English of Yorkshire.
The current Supreme Commission has made legislation to introduce the name change, saying, "The final decision on any explanation of the name for the AMs is of course a problem for the members themselves."
The Wales government’s 2017 decision gave the Wales branch authority the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published a public consultation on a well-known proposal to receive broad support for the title of the mayor as Parliament.
Regarding the issue of AMs, the Commission prefers WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members/ Members of Parliament Welsh), but MWP options get the most support for public consultation.
The AMs seem to provide alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus can dissociate the leader, Elin Jones, who was expected to hand over the bill in a few weeks' time.
These reforms laws will cover other changes-- changes in the way in which wholesale work is done, including disqualification rules for AMs and committee system planning.
The AMs will get a final voice on the question of how they should be called when they discuss laws.
The Macedonian people went to give a speech on the referendum on the change of country name
Voice owners will decide whether their country name will be changed to "North Macedonian Republic."
The sound was heard in an effort to settle the dispute for a decade with Greece’s neighbor, who also had a province called Macedonia.
Athena has long insisted that the name of the neighboring country on its north side shows an acknowledgement of its territory and has repeatedly rejected the European Union and NATO membership bid.
President of Macedonia Gjorge Ibanov, an opponent of the vote to change his name, has said that he will ignore the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is the price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's Lonceng-lonceng when the church in Harlem was in trouble.
"Historically, the old people I spoke to say there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Mr. Adam
"Today, no one."
He said that disappearing all those bars could be overcome.
"People are socializing in other ways" now, he says.
"But it's no longer a public guest room around where people regularly visit it."
Likewise with the church, he worried that the proceeds of the asset sale would not last as long as the leaders expected, "and quickly or late they will return from the beginning."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by an apartment building with a condominium filled with people who would not help keep the holy places around him.
"The majority of people who will buy condominium in these buildings are white people," he said, "and that's why they'll speed up the day where these churches close together because it's not possible that those who move to those condominium will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by a white church before Harlem became the metropolis of the Black People’s Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The Metodis region of the original white skin moved in the 1930s.
The black - and - black areas around the area took over the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a black community under the leadership of Prince John Howard, who led a trade fair on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to work or promote black people.
The building was severely damaged by fire in 1939, but when the parishioners of Prince Johnson planned to rebuild it, they built a tower tower tower.
Prince David Johnson, Prince Johnson's Son and his replacement at St. Martin, proud to call the tower bells as "the poor people's bells."
One expert who called the tower bells in July gave him another name: "A cultural treasure" and "a historic instrument that is unparalleled."
One expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University also noted that this was the first tower bell in the world played by black leather musicians, Dionysius A. Lind, who turned on the larger tower bell in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What happened in Santo Martin in the last few months was a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought by public church leaders, and others brought by the Episcopal Group.
Westerners -- the board of directors, formed by the leaders of the public -- wrote to the generals in July with concern that the group "will strive to pay the costs" on the western side, although the Westerners are not involved in the group of architects and contractors sent by the generals.
Some parishioners have avoided a lack of transparency on the part of the general public.
Hiu injured a teenager 13 years of age in the California lobbying
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he drowned to catch a lobster in California at the opening of the lobster season, an officer's education.
The attack took place before 7: 00 p.m. near the Beacon Coast at Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had drowned with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy asking for help and then grouped up to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was only a joy after he caught the lobster, but then he "attempted" that the boy screamed, "I was bitten!
I'm bitten!'
All the bones are breaking," Hammel said he realized when he had the child.
And I cried unto all the people to come out of the water, saying, There is a fiery furnace in the waters.
The boy was taken to the San Diego Children’s Hospital, where he was treated in critical circumstances.
The species responsible for the attack are unknown.
Captain Larry Giles Coast Guard said in a media conference that a shark had been seen in the area a week before, but it was classified as non-hazardous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injury to the upper part of his body.
Officers closed access to the beach from the Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinita for 48 hours for research and security.
Giles realized that there were more than 135 shark species in this region, but most of them were considered harmless.
Sinesbury's article splits the English beauty market
Sciencebury took over Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with a pair of beauty-like tortoises run by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial drive to the British beauty market worth £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while selling fashion products and household appliances down, the biggest beauty kiosks will be tested at 11 stores across the country and will be developed as more shops next year if it proves to be successful.
Investment in beauty is a hunt for the supermarket to use the people that used to be used as a shelter TV, microwave, and household appliances.
Sciencebury said that it would represent a great offer of beauty up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The brand range that is currently beginning from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with the rotting area as found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunched its shopping cart so that most of its products would be friendly to vegans - something that young investors were increasingly interested in.
In addition, fragrance cleaner Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two stores of Sciencebury, the first one opened in Croydon. South London last week, while the second one will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, at the end of this year.
Online shopping and changing the daily needs of food in small numbers in local retail stores means that the supermarket has to do something more to lure people to visit.
Mike Coupe, the executive head of Sciencebury, has said that the speeds will become more and more like Mall when the supermarket chain is trying to fight back shoppers like Aldi and Lidl by providing more and more services without food.
Sciencebury has put Argos' chains in hundreds of stores and also introduced several Habitats' rings since they bought them two years ago, which he said has supported the sale of daily food and made a more favourable statement.
The former supermarket to renovate the beauty and pharmaceutical department ended with failure.
Science was testing the breakup with Boots in early 2000, but the same work ended after there was a dispute about how to share the benefits of the chemical market in that supermarket.
A new strategy emerged after Science sold 281 pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Farms' novelty, worth £125 million, three years ago.
It was announced that Lloyds would play a role in that article, adding a variety of expensive skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sciencebury, said: "We have changed our appearance and appearance on beautiful kiosks to repair the atmosphere for our visitors.
We also invest in trained colleagues who will be ready to offer advice.
Our brand range is designed to suit all needs, a tight environment and a comfortable location.
Peter Jones 'warm' after Holly Willoughby withdrew from the £11 million contract
Dragons Den Star, Peter Jones went "with rage" after the performer Holly Willoughby pulled himself out of a life-style business deal worth £11 million to focus more on his new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to handle the trademarks of their stairs and their accessories, True.
This couple’s business is compared to the Goop’s Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
The founder of this morning program, 37 years old, used his Instagram account to announce that he was out.
Holly Willoughby has made the Dragons star" Den, Petes Jones angry with an interest in the last few hours, from their lucrative lifestyle business - to focus on his larger contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The source says that Jones was so "hot" when the gold girl admitted during the meeting on Tuesday at his business center in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new deal -- worth up to £1.5 million -- he no longer had enough time to serve on the trademark of their domestic appliances and accessories, True.
Their business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to increase Willoughby's wealth by a total of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, used Instagram to announce that he left True, Jones flew away from Britain to one of his holiday homes,
One source says, "Truly so far is the most important Holly priority.
It was going to be a long-term future, which would keep it going for a few decades.
Its decision to give up makes all those involved are deeply affected.
No one can believe what happened on that Tuesday, very close to the launch time.
There's a warehouse full of stuff in Marlow's main office ready to sell."
Experts believe that this Morning, which is one of the most expensive British stars, can damage the company up to millions of dollars because of a large investment in product form, starting from wet and purple to clothing and household furniture, and there is a potential for further launch.
And this can mean that it's ended with a long relationship.
Mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband and Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby set up True with Capp in 2016, and 52 - year - old Jones joined in the leadership in March.
The couple were vacationing together, and Jones had 40 percent of the stock on the Baldwin TV production company.
Willoughby will be a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the leader of I'm A Celebrity's I'm.
A number close to Jones said last night, "We won't comment on this business relationship."
Speaking seriously 'and then we fall in love'
He was joking about the criticism he would get from the news because of making comments that were considered by some as "unpresidential" and had been very positive to North Korean leaders.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said his "new-reader"'s voice.
"I don't give up anything."
He knew that Kim was interested in meeting twice after the previous meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump praised as a step forward for the North Korean revolution.
But the denuclearization negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after a meeting in June in Singapore, North Korea's highest diplomat Ri Yong Ho spoke to the world leaders on Saturday, the United Nations General Council that North Korea did not see "a proper response" from the United States to the early arms movement in North Korea.
On the contrary, he noted that the United States continued to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump looks more optimistic in the range of his speech.
"We do the best with North Korea," he said.
"If we fight North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have this amazing relationship,"
He said that his success in improving his relationship with Kim had resulted in a positive outcome — stopping the rockets, helping to free the hostages, and returning the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he stood up for his insensible approach to talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but compared to having 10,000 people outside who are trying to get into this hot arena, we'd better have about 200 people standing there," said Trump, pointing to a crowd that was right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunamis and earthquakes devastated an island, killing hundreds of people
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations have been told that they are not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population lost their homes, there was no national declaration of disaster, as a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they've explained that they're not asking for international help, so this is somewhat challenging," Mrs. Sumbung said.
While Save The Children are planning a team to go to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, the jury spoke on a national disaster management body, said that the Indonesian office was monitoring the situation in Palu to see if the foreign agencies were allowed to contribute to the relief.
In view of the ongoing influx of Indonesia, this country is still not ready to face natural wrath.
While the tsunami shelter was built in Aceh, it was not a public view on the other shoreline.
There's no tsunami alert siren in Palu, although the danger warning has been reported, it's probably contributed to the existence of a life-sacrificial victim.
At the best of times, the journey between many islands of Indonesia is very challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
It will take at least three days to reach a new location.
President Joko Widodo has built a damaged Indonesia infrastructure as the essence of the election campaign, and he has spent money on the construction of the highway and the railway.
However, a lack of funds disturbed Father Joko’s rulership while he was facing his election back in the year ahead.
Mr. Joko also faced pressure from the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims have embraced the form of more conservative beliefs.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands fled their homes when Muslim and Christian groups fought on the streets, using guns, bows, and arrows, and other sharp weapons.
Witness: Player Liverpool Daniel Sturridge inserts balance goals against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea at the Premier League with a score at 89 minutes on Saturday at Stamford Bridge London.
Sturridge received the bait from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from outside Chelsea Bay when the team left 1-0.
He put the ball on his left side before he threw it to a long pole.
It's a high-voltage ball on top of the gauze when the ball moves to the right corner of the chain.
The ball finally fell through the risk of jumping and falling into a chain.
"It's just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I'm just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and take one chance and don't think too much of it, and just make a strain."
Chelsea led with score 1-0 in the first half after the original Belgian player Eden Hazard printed a blank on the 25th minute.
The Blue attack gave Matthew Kovacic a turn on the game, before turning near the middle line and running fast into the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly gave the bait and ran in the middle line.
He then made a perfect strain, leading Hazard to the gawal.
Hazard made it through the back of the fight and kicked the ball into the corner with his left leg, crossed the Liverpool Alison Becker.
Liverpool v. Naples at the League Champion's discharge section on Wednesday 3rd afternoon at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea faced a video game at the UEFA European League at 3 p.m. on Friday in London.
The victims of Indonesia's tsunami increased to 832
The victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832 people, reports the country’s disaster report on Sunday morning.
Many people are reported to be trapped in the destruction of buildings that were destroyed by an earthquake of 7.5 Richter scale, which took place on Friday and triggered a 20 - foot - high earthquake, Sutopo Purwo, a jurist in a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is filled with fallen buildings.
The police arrested a man, 32 years old, for attempted murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has taken place after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at Grayson Mews, John's street, at 7.55 p.m. with some squeezing wounds, while a 32-year-old man was detained for murder.
The police have asked people around to see or hear something to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "Research is still at an early stage, but I'm asking everyone around John's street at Birkenhead who sees or hears something suspicious to contact us.
I'm also cheering on everyone, especially the taxi drivers, who might have recorded something on the front camera to contact us because they might have important information to investigate us.
The jury has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is the local inhabitants of Birkenhead and she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who felt confident that they knew the woman had come to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
Research is still going on, like the police have said, they're in the process of telling their relatives about the victims.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just came back to his apartment, but it was told by the police that no one was allowed to come in or out of the building.
The man couldn't say anything when he knew what was going on.
Now the citizens are being told that it will take a few hours until they are allowed back in.
A police officer is hearing someone say that all areas are now being treated as a scene of events.
A woman appears in a place where she cries.
He's always saying, "This is terrible."
At 2:00 a.m., two police van cars were on the line and the others were out.
A number of officers are standing in the line to watch the apartment blocks.
Anyone who has information requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCc, phone 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 with log 247 on September 30.
The House of Parlemen Cromwell was the last monument marked by a 'historical rewriting'
Its destruction will be a poet's justice for the destruction of the Taliban against many of the cultural and religious artifacts of England made by the pagan Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell community described Mr. Crick's advice as "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, leader of the Cromwell Society, said: "This cannot be avoided in the debate at this moment about the destruction of images, that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster's palace will become a target.
The Anglo - American World Power was not commanded or done by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong offspring of Cromwell would have been sacrificed to his ancestors in the preceding century.
The amazing representation of Cromwell of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a 19th - century opinion and part of the history of a figure that is still believed by many to be worthy of celebration.
Mr. Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps by the end of the 19th century more than today, as parliamentary advocates against outside pressure, of course the kingdom.
Whether it's a completely accurate representation, it's still a subject of a controversial historical debate.
Which is certain that conflict in the middle of the 17th century has formed the next nation's development, and Cromwell is a society that can be identified as an individual representing one side of that difference.
He is worthy of all praise, and worthy of all praise.
Killers Love Chinese Farmers Until They Leave
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southeastern Chinese market, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his brand name "Yuan", was found to die with a broken artery, blood flow near a pig camp in the Guizhou area of Liupanshui province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject a vaccine to pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in the Xining province of Qinghai, China.
He was reported to have gone with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Thursday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and saw the pig’s tent door near him opened.
He said that in the pig’s den there was a great pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic research confirms that the 550-pound-weighted feral pig has persecuted the farmer until his death, according to the report.
"My cousin baptized and destroyed," said the cousin known as "Wu", as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been detained to prevent him from attacking others, while the police collected evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and market authorities are reported to be relegating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of swine attacks on humans have occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts, causing a serious injury to the man.
Ten years ago, a pig weighed 650 pounds to the tractor of a Welsh farmer until the fearsome wife drove the animal out.
After a farmer named Oregon was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the pig was usually not aggressive but the smell of blood could act as a "pemicu".
"They're just playing games.
They sneezed, very curious to know... they won't come out to hurt you.
You just need to give him enough respect," he said.
The rest of the Rosa storm brought their rains to the west of the United States.
As you can imagine, the Rosa storm weakened when it moved above a colder lake on the northern coast of Mexico.
Anyway, Rosa will cause rains throughout the region of Mexico north and west of the United States in a few days.
Rosa has a wind speed of 85 mph, Category 1 storm, starting at 5 a.m. On Sunday, the Eastern Region, and is 385 miles west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa was likely moving north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Palung began to form above the Pacific Ocean and moved east, towards the Western coast of the United States. When Rosa approached the end of California on Monday as a tropical storm and began to push the tropics toward the north to the west of the United States.
Rosa will bring rain to 10 inches in most of Mexico's territory on Monday.
Then, a tropical tide that interacts with the closeest of the world will produce widespread rains in the West of the Diaspora for a few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause a dangerous typhoid flood, the puddles and the possibility of long-term land in the desert.
A low tropical tide will cause the rainfall levels to range from 2 to 3 inches per hour at some points, especially in the southern part of Nevada and Arizona.
As many as 2 to 4 inches of rain are estimated to descend in some parts of the West of the Day, especially in most Arizona.
The flood is likely to take place with conditions that deteriorate rapidly because of the widespread tropical rain.
It is not very recommended to travel through the desert by walking on foot because of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause the floods to become violent, and storms can lead to local storms and droughts.
Nearly half the coast of South California will cause local rains to fall.
The total rainfall that exceeds half of the inch is quite possible, which can cause small points to flow and the road to be smooth.
It'll be the first rain in that area in their rainy season.
Some widespread tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona at the end of the week and at the end of the morning, before the rain gets wider on Monday and Saturday.
The great rains will spread to four horsemen on Tuesdays and will last until Wednesday.
In October there will be some great temperature changes throughout the United States when the Arctic gets colder, but the tropical region remains quite warm.
Sometimes it causes dramatic temperature changes in the short term.
There is an accurate example of the dramatic differences in temperature throughout the U.S. middle of the week.
There is a total temperature difference of almost 20 degrees Fahrenheit [20 ° C] between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
For a few days ahead, the remaining summer temperatures will be formed and will be returned to the field.
Most of the U.S. central and eastern regions are expected to start warm in October with a speed of 80s from the South to the eastern sea.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast showed a high chance for temperatures above average for the eastern United States by mid-October.
More than 20 million people have witnessed Brett Kavanaugh's judgment.
More than 20 million people witnessed an interesting statement on Thursday by the High Court of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused of committing the alleged sexual violence in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political turmoil continues, with publishers who have concluded a regular event to announce unexpected events in the last minute of Friday: An agreement planned by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct one week's investigation of the charge.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that the woman was 100 percent sure if Kavanaugh had slammed her body in a drunken state and tried to get rid of her clothes at the high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his fiery testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
Probably more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday have watched it.
The company counts the averages of mirrors in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Calculation for other networks that transmit this is not available fast, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen is usually in trouble with counting the number of people who saw him in the office.
To put this in perspective, it's a number of spectators who are almost the same as the football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, who thinks its founders are very supportive of the Kavanaugh show, is the largest of all networks with an average of 5.69 million mirrors throughout the day, says Nielsen.
ABC has a second seat of 3.26 million.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million mirrors and CNN with 2.52 million, says Nielsen.
The interest continued after the trial.
Flake was the key to that Friday drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican Party issued a statement that he would choose to support Kavanaugh, he was arrested by CNN and CBS camera on Friday morning, being shouted by the sensational proponents when he tried to take the elevator to the justice committee.
He stood down for a few minutes when he was tracked down, broadcast directly to the CNN.
"I stand right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think that he's telling the country the truth?
He said, "You have power when there are many women who are weak."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that there were many other things he had to say in the committee.
The cable TV and the broadcasting network were all intertwined a few hours later, when the Judicial Committee would choose to promote Kavanaugh's appeal to the whole Senate for a hearing.
But Flake says he's just gonna do it with understanding that the FBI will investigate the charges against the remonstrators for a week ahead, as the minority Democrats have requested.
Flake has been assured by some of the conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons.
Pasca talked to Coons and some senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice has power, because it's clear that the Republic's party will not have a voice to approve Kavanaugh without any investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister of England accused the critic of playing politics on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critic of playing politics with the future of Britain and ruining national interests, on his plan to leave the European Union, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews that appeared on the front page, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed the attack on what he called the Chequers for Brexit plan, saying that the proposal on England and the EU that should collect tariffs for each other was "full of nonsense."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect on a fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and imprisoned for murder at two levels, says Baton Rouge Police Department.
The video-recording officer between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his eyes during the fight.

Coroner's office of the Eastern Baton Rouge Park reports a recovery report on Friday, says the cause of death is a head shot to the throat.
The department thanks to the gufus of the fledgling mission of the Louisiana National Police, the crime lab of the state police, the South University police and the surrounding population in research aid that leads to arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local lawmakers for "strengthening and seeking justice."
Sims was 20 years old at the time.
With 6,6 feet up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
The average point is 5.6 and it's up to 2.6 in the game last summer.
On Friday morning, LSU Will Wade coach said his team felt "damaged" and "surprising" with Wade's death.
"This is what you're worried about all the time," Wade said.
Mountain fires up the ashes in Mexico City
Abu who came out of the mountain fire Popocatepetl has reached the southern part of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday to get away from the firefighting mountain after activity increased in cattle and registered there were 183 emissions of gas and ashes in a period of more than 24 hours.
The station watched a few violent and violent times.
The pictures in the media social media show a tiny gray layer that is stuck on the front of the car window in the area around Mexico City.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase of 45 miles (72 km) south of the city’s capital since the 7.1 earthquake struck Mexico in September 2017.
This mountain is known as Don Goyo, which has been active since 1994.
The patrol police with Catalan separatist down to the independence election celebration.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the protest protests were protested against the anti-circumvention police, and when thousands of people joined in protest to mark the first polling ceremony in Catalonia about self-defense.
A group of pro-separatists who were held by the anti-aircraft police threw them with their eggs and threw them into the mud, so they created a dark cloud of dust on the roads that would normally be filled by tourists.
The fight also took place after that day with police officers using their rod to control the fight.
For a few hours, pro-individual groups shouted "Don't forget, there's no forgiveness" in front of the fan of the workers' gangs screaming, "Hidup Spanish."
Fourteen people received treatment for the minor damage they received in the prosthetics, the local press reports.
A year after the October 1st referendum, which was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists, the region’s strength remained high.
The electorate prefers to be freer, even though the low number of electorate is with those who oppose separation and most of the electorate.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the noise from the GPS throughout the region in a severe storm.
Pro-individual groups camped last night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of national police ranks.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take different routes.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended separatist prosthetics with his wife, said that he no longer hoped for the prospect of Catalonia's independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out because they could choose, but now we're trapped," he said.
Even though it was a little successful in the December regional election, Catalan pro-independence parties have fought to defend this year's moment, although many of their well-known leaders, who are in isolation or in detention, are awaiting trial, for their role in organizing referendums and further declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests with his cell phone to support the police, said that the conflict had been picked up by politicians on both sides.
"Now it's getting harder," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been in pre-trial custody since last year, announced that he would step forward in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Joining as a candidate for European elections is the best way to threaten prosperity in the values of democracy and oppression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: How many men were arrested after a house was hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly broke down a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at the Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said that the damage occurred at the gate and the building itself.
A passerby may have been shot in the direction of the car at some points.
The goal that is printed by Menga has given Livingstone the victory over Rangers with score 1-0
First goal Dolly Guess for Livingstone to make sure the win
Livingstone's victory led the Rangers to release Steven Gerrard from his position as the Ibrox club manager, for both of them in 18 matches.
The Dolly Menga attack has been evidence of a difference when Gary Holt's side movement is similar to that of Hibernate in the second row.
Gerrard's side remains unbeatable in the Premiership this summer and faces the leaders of Hearts who are eight points in front of them, next Sunday.
Previously, Rangers was visiting Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingstone, meanwhile, extended the unbeatable record of them in the division to six matches, while Holt's coach chief was still in the process of defeating Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone lost the chance to fight a brave guest team.
The Holt team should have been proud long before they printed a goal, with their accuracy that gave Rangers a variety of difficulties.
Scott Robinson managed to break through, but his efforts to cross the gaul, then Alan Lithgow could only expand his efforts after the entry and face of Craig Halkett's swing from across the gaul.
Homer feels satisfied to let Rangers play proud early, knowing that they can make the arrival team more difficult than the death ball happens.
And that's how to create a very important goal.
Rangers of free movement and Livingstone got a chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to help Menga, who got rounds and prints blanks from the middle of the field.
At that stage, Rangers had dominated power but realized that the housekeeper's defenses could not be defeated and Liam Kelly's Cyprus was completely uninhibited,
It went on to second grade, although Alfredo Morelos managed to fish for Kelly's rescue.
Scott Pittman was beaten by guards rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow far away due to the tactics of other Livingstone games.
The attack continues to come to Livingston's cage and is constantly being avoided, while two warrants - after Halkett's challenge to the player's replacement Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - refused.
Livingston's Phenomenal - Analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont by Tony Macaroni Arena
The performance and the outstanding results for Livingstone.
For a man, they're amazing, they're still beyond hope on the journey that goes on.
The game and their staff have hardly changed since they got back to the top of the board, but the big credit has to be given to Holt by how he strengthened the team since his arrival.
He's got so many strawberries.
Captain Halkett was very big, leading well-organized defenses, while Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall stay alert during the game.
Even so, Rangers lack inspiration.
Whatever they did under Gerard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their last ball is less good-- only once they can break the formation of the house side-- and it's a reminder to Rangers, who realizes their presence in the middle of the field.
Erdogan's got a different audience in Cologne.
There were smiles and blue skyscrapers on Saturday (September 29th) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany -- aimed at improving the relationship between NATO allies.
They debate issues, including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open up a new grand sanctuary.
This city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police mentioned security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters moved around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-erdogan Protestants -- many of them Kurdishs -- also voiced, threatened both, Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him to that country.
The resistance protests describe the existence of an individual who was welcomed as a hero by a few Turkish citizens and sought to be a dictator by another citizen.
Shots on the Deptford highway: Shot riders are killed in a car crash
A bicycle driver died in a shooting involving a car in London.
Tabrakan took place near the Beswyod Street and Evelyn Street, many streets in Deptford, on the southeast side of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the paramedics came, but the man died at the scene.
The crash took place months after another bike driver died in a run-in at Childers Street, about 1 mile away from the strike that Saturday.
The Metropolitan police say the officers are trying to identify the man and preach to his family.
The roads were closed and the bus routes were operated and motorized to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six injured officers in the suburbs
Six Cypriots suffered injury in a man - in - jail accident with severe care, the office said.
Problems occurred in the HMP Long Lartin prison at Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST (GMT+0100) on Sunday and still on.
Specialist Officer "Tornado" has been handed over to deal with the suspicion, involving eight prisoners and taking place on one side of the building.
Officers are being treated at the scene because of minor injuries in the face.
A jury spoke, saying: "The specially trained lap officer has been assigned to handle the incident that is happening in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have been treated for injury.
We don't tolerate violence in this prison, and it's clear that the responsible will be handed over to the police and maybe it'll have to spend a longer time behind bars."
The HMP Long Lartin prison supports more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous naparadists.
In June it was reported that the head of the prison was treated in the hospital after being attacked by a naraphim.
And in October yesterday, an anti-circumvention officer was called to prison to handle serious suspicions where a police officer was attacked with a pool ball.
The Rosa storm threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with a flood of rain (maybe it rains)
The tropical depression that hit Arizona rarely happens, but that's what's likely to happen in the early weeks of the next week because the remaining traces of the energy of the Rose storm that went through the western power desert, led to a risk of floods.
The National Weather Service has issued a warning that there will be a flood on Monday and Tuesday for the West Arizona region to South Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is supposed to be heading straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, hitting the late evening with the rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix mentioned on Twitter that there are only "ten tropical storms capable of causing tropical storms or depression in 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) is a storm within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The latest Midwive Crew can predict 2 to 4 inches of rain with an isolated number of up to 6 inches in Mogollon Rim Arizona.
Another western part of the desert including the central Rockies and Great Basin is likely to be 1 to 2 inches, with the possibility of a number of isolations reaching 4 inches.
For those in the free zone of the riverbed, the Rosa rain may be a blessing because of the drought.
Although the flood is a serious problem, most of this rainstorm is likely to benefit because it is now the western part of the power being drained.
According to the U.S. survey of U.S. decline, only about 40 percent of Arizona areas suffer from a little extreme decline, the second highest category," weather.com reports.
First, the route through the Red Cross leads south across California Bay on the coast of Mexico City
Rosa, still on the stormy force on Sunday morning with the speed of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north with the speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm hit the warmer waters of the Pacific Ocean, and for that reason its strength was weakened.
That's why it's supposed to land in Mexico with a tropical storm force on the afternoon or at night.
Rain may be high in some parts of Mexico, causing high flood risk
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is estimated to cross the California Basin to the western area of Sonora's power, possibly up to 10 inches," weather.com reports.
Then Rosa will cross the north along Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border today as a tropical depression, which will pass through Arizona and the South to the Middle Ages.
"The main risk that may be caused by the Rosa storm or the rest of it is a very high rainfall in Baja California, the western area of Sonora, and the U.S. western region of the U.S. desert." The National Storm Centre (NHC) said.
The rain is expected to cause the flood and the puddles of buildings that flow into the desert, and it happens to be the long-lasting land in the mountainous region.
Midsomer Norton attack: four suspects' arrests
Three young men and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a broken wound in Somerset.
The young man was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace Midsomer Norton area, about 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he was in stable condition.
A 17 - year - old man, two 18 - year - olds, and a 20 - year - old man were arrested overnight in Radstock, Avon, and Somerset, says the police.
Officers have been laughing at anyone who might have had that video of events on his cell phone to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh 'accepted hatred and anger' from the Democratic Party
"One voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the harsh and shameful Democratic Party's influence," Trump said in a campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "accepted hatred and anger" from the Democratic Party during the prosecution process
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Congress on Thursday, with forced and emotionally denying a charge by Christine Blasey Ford that he had committed sexual violence to her a few decades ago when they were still a teenager.
Ford also testified in the verdict on his statement.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw the wisdom and quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice of support for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to strengthen someone who has the most perfect law thought in our day, a jury with a record of true public servants," he said to a group of West Virginia supporters.
The president implicitly refers to Kavanaugh's recruitment when discussing the importance of the Republic's participation in the middle of the election.
"Five weeks before it happens one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really freaking out," he said.
"That's why I went there to the sea, fighting for a great horseman.
Trump argues that the Democrats are on the mission to "oppress and block."
The procedure for the first vote at Senate level in Kavanaugh's quest is expected to be carried out as late as Friday, a deputy GOP leader's assistant told CNN.
Hundreds of people died because of Indonesia's tsunami disaster, with increased numbers of victims
At least 384 people were killed, many were killed when the giant storm hit the beach, when the earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi Indonesia, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when the six - foot - high [18 m] cliff destroyed the beach in the evening, causing a lot of death and destruction of everything it passed.
Tsunami was followed by an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat increased yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and not running so quickly as to become victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a jury spoke for the BNPB at a time of emergency in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, wood, houses, landing all that was in the south," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the sea off at 800 kph (497 mph) before landing the beach line.
Some people climb a tree to save themselves from tsunamis and rescues, he says.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to the 24 service centers in Palu.
The photos of the air produced by the BNPB show a number of ruined buildings and shops, a wooden bridge, and a water tower.
It's a slow-flowing storm that hits the city all over the beach on Saturday.
Earthquakes are felt in the area of 2.4 million people.
The Research and Technology Management (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released at the Friday mass earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb force dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city’s geographic location, which lies at the edge of a narrow narrow edge, can be said to increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho describes the damage that happened as "extensive" and says that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have been destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of a ruined building, he said, adding that there were 540 injured victims and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and damage could be larger along the 300 km (190 miles) line along the north side of Palu, a region called Dongala, which is closer to the center of the earthquake.
Communication "very smooth with no information from Dongala, Nugroho says.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their members and volunteers are heading to a region affected by the disaster.
"This is a tragedy, but it can get worse," he said.
The agency concerned that Saturday received a lot of criticism because it did not inform that there was a tsunami that struck Palu, although the authorities said that the waves had fallen at the time the warning was issued.
An amateur recording shared in media society shows a man on the floor on a building that sounds like a warning with a panic will be close to the tsunami, to the direction of the people on the street below.
In the minutes of the water cycle, the shoreline shuts down the building and the car.
Reuters can't immediately prove the origins of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunamis are the biggest causes of the power plants that break down communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate their rescue efforts.
Military authorities have already begun to send cargo ships with help from Jakarta and the other cities, according to the authorities, but refugees are still desperately in need of food and other necessities of the tree.
The airport has been reopened only to provide relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been scheduled to visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia's Tsunami victim increased by 800.
That's very scary.
When World Vision officials from Dongala managed to survive in the city of Palu, where the officers were sheltered in the tent of cloths built on their office site, on their journeys they had crossed a variety of reddish areas, said Father Dosebaba.
"They told me that they had seen many ruined houses," he said.
That's terrible.
Even when the relief team began to move slowly to start disaster management activities, some of the groups prevented there from being targeted at foreign volunteers with expertise, who were going to go to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, immigration, goods and energy aid from outside the country can only begin to be reported if the area affected has been officially declared as a national disaster area.
That's not happening yet.
"It's still a province-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a jury speaking for the Red Battle of Indonesia.
"When the government says, OK, this is a national disaster," we get international help, but there's no status yet."
On the second of the night, when the sun and the moon set, the companions and the families of those who had lost themselves hope that those whom they loved will be part of a miracle that will heal the hearts of those who have lost a natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was expelled from the kitchen.
On Sunday, the rescuer released a woman lying under a pillow for two days along with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandoro, a coach of Indonesia’s national parachute team, has been a coach for two missing parachute athletes, who were able to follow the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Those still trapped in Hotel Roa-Roa, along with Father Mandagi, were his disciples.
"As a senior in the nursing sector, I have a personal emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recounted how after the news of the destroyed Roa-Roa Hotel departed around the paramilitary community, with despair he sent a message to whatsApp to the Palu competitions, who also attended a party on the beach.
Even so, all of his messages, only got one sign of gray pencil, not two blue pencils.
"I think it means no message sent," he said.
The robbery took $26,750 during ATM landing at Newport in Levee.
A robbery on Friday morning, stealing $26,750 from a Brink officer who's refilling the ATM machine storage box in Newport, based on the announcement of the Newport Police Department.
The car driver has emptied an ATM machine in the entertainment complex and is ready to transfer more money, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in an announcement.
While he was working, another man ran behind the Brink and stole one bag full of money that would be sent.
The Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, on the basis of the announcement, but the police did not mention the number of people involved.
Anyone who has information about their identity can contact the Newport police in 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Rapper turned its name into Ye
Rapper Kanye West turns his name into Ye.
Advertised the name on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "It was formerly formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, already has the name Ye for some time and uses it as its eighth album title, which was written in June.
The changes were made before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to win his new album, Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande's singer to show on the show, which was cancelled for "emotional reasons," said the performer.
As a short for his professional name right now, before West said that for him it had religious meaning.
"I believe 'ye' is a common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year, discussing the album title with the publishers of Radio Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, that name is us.
That name was taken from Kanye, which means only one, to be Ye--as a mirror of our goodness, our misfortune, our confusion, all.
It's more like our true self-defense."
He was one of a number of rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known in various ways as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator, JAY-Z also made it with or without a sign of connection and a big letter.
Mexico President AMLO swore not to use military in the face of civil society
The elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn that he will never use military force against civil society until the 50th anniversary of a bloody revenge against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that "he would never use military force to force Mexicans."
The army fired fire on demonstration activities that took place peacefully at the Plaza on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at that time, when the movement of left wing students planted its roots throughout the Latin American region.
Lopez Obrador has already secured support for young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those who are studying and opening more free universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunity for education have led young people to become criminal gangs.
A.S. is supposed to represent the A.I.
Because China is more active in the field of engineering intelligence, the U.S. should draw up the amount of money that will be used for research in the field, says the investor and practice A2 Kai-Fu Lee, who is already working for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comment came after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even when the U.S. completely lacked formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China identified its plan last year: to become number 1 in the 2030 AI innovation.
"Recognising the AI research resources is a good start, remembering all other countries tend to stay away from the US, and we're looking for the next breakthrough in the AI," Lee said.
Assuming the funds can represent a chance that the next major Al will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lea, owner of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" has published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he designed an AI system that beats the best Othello American player, and then he serves as an executive at Microsoft Research and the Chinese branch president of Google.
Lee acknowledged the U.S. government technology competition earlier like the Robotics Challenge for the Mutakhir Defense Research Project and asked when the next action would be carried out, to help identify the next visioner.
The U.S. researchers often have to work hard to win the government's gift, Lee says.
"It's not China that took the head of the academy; it's a company," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been working on individuals from the university for the last few years of AI research.
Lee says that immigration policy changes can also help the US to support AI's efforts.
"I think green cards can be offered automatically for HDD class holders in the AI field," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued its next Generational Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Yayasan Natural Science China provides funds for people in academic institutions just like Yayasan Natural Science and other government organizations that distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the lower quality of academic work in China, Lee says.
Early this year at the U.S. Department of Defence developed the Joint Intelligence Centre, which aims to involve industrial partners and academics, and the White Buildings announced the formation of the Selection Committee for Industrial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment worth $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
For the NSF, DARPA recently invested over $100 million a year for AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation calling for it to be set up by the National Security Commission for Built-in Intelligence does not see any further action for months.
Macedonians made voice calls on the country's name change range
The Macedonian people made a public announcement on Sunday to decide on the country's name change as "the Republic of North Macedonia," an action that will resolve the conflict for a decade with Greece that has begun its membership bid to be part of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a Macedonian province, defends the view that the name of the neighboring country on its north side represents ownership of its territory and has banned its association with NATO and the European Union.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name, but nationalist opposition argued that the change would damage the identity of most ethnic Slavia Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not give his voice to the public election and a boycott campaign has raised doubts as to whether the election results could reach a minimum of 50 percent of the votes required for the election results to be declared valid.
The question on the ballot is, "Do you agree to NATO and the EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is an appropriate price to be paid to gain access to bodies such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born of the destruction of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to give my voice for the future of the country, for the young generations of Macedonia so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, it is enough for many Members of parliament to say that they will obey the outcome of the vote to make a decision.
The name change needs to be changed to a total of two or three times in parliament.
The State Election Commission says there is no record of violations until 1 day.
However, it turns out that the vote was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the voters listed their vote.
"I came to give my voice for my children, where we are in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, an elector in the capital of the city, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko gave their voice for the general election in Macedonia in a series of changes to the country's name that would open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov has prepared a small stage and pulled the seats in front of the tents made by those who are going to throw the sound away.
"We agree to join NATO and the European Union, but we want to join in honor, not through the service door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have a reputation.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring more investment needed for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe most people will agree because more than 80 percent of our society supports the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after giving his voice.
He said "yes" would be "the confirmation of our future."
A poll published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute on Monday yesterday stated that between 30 and 43 percent of the electorate would take part in the poll - less than the required number.
Another opinion, maintained by the TV station Telma Macedonia, found 57 percent of the responses planned to be given on Sundays.
Of them, 70 percent said they would choose yes.
To achieve that goal, 50 percent more than one voice is needed.
A failure in the soundout would represent a first policy rejection against the pro-Brat government since the shift in May last year.
Sergio Aguero from Manchester City went through the entire Brighton defense to print a score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were handed over as Brighton's defense at Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England.
Aguero made that victory seem very easy on his score in the minutes to 65.
Argentina’s attackers received an opera in the field at the start of the game.
He ran between the three of Briggton's defenders, before the Nuts entered the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green men.
He turned over one of the defenders before running ahead of some of the other fighters at the edge of Brighton's gang.
Then he leaned on his left side, to Sterling.
The front of the English band took advantage of its first strain from the gangster to operate the ball back to Aguero, who used its right foot to defeat the Briggton Cup, Mathew Ryan with a strain to the right of the gangster.
"Aguero fights with some problems on his feet," said Pep Guardiola City manager to the reporter.
"We talked about himself playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're honest with him to print a goal at that time."
But Sterling is the one who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the battle of the Premier League.
The goal took place in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball, far in the Brighton area on that game.
He hit the ball with a long, long, humming stick through the left wing of Leroy Sane.
Sane did a little ball stick before driving Sterling to the remote post.
Sky Blue front slide the ball to the right direction before the ball launches out of the border.
City against Hoppenheim in the Champions League game at 12.55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to run a cracker versus Rockies
By eliminating Nationals from the playoff game, there's no more reason to force another match.
But Scherzer is too competitive to be able to win Colorado Rockies on Sundays, but only if there's still a playoff implications for Rockies, which is a great one in a Los Angeles Dodgers game in NL West.
Rockies at least didn't get a place after winning a wild-card game against the Nationals with a score of 5-2 on Friday night, but still trying to get their first division class.
"Even though we played without winning, at least we can't know the weather in Denver with a audience and other teams that will compete at the highest level of any point I might face this year.
How come I don't want to compete in a game like that?"
Nationals haven't announced an open match for Sunday, but it's reported that in such a situation, they tend to let Scherzer join the game.
Scherzer, who will start his 34th reading session on Thursday, began the Sunday session that was usually used for rest.
The Pitcher right-hand Washington is wearing a score 18-7 with an average running (ERA) 2.53 and 300 strike-out in 220 2/3 inches this session.
Trump campaigned in West Virginia.
The president deliberately referred to the situation in which the Supreme Court ruled his election, Brett Kavanaugh, when discussing the importance of the Republic's public voice in the middle of the election.
"Every effort we've made has been made in November.
Five weeks before he made the most important choice in our life.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not really running that's why I'm fighting everywhere for an amazing candidate," he said.
Trump goes on, "You see there's a radical group of Democrats that's very exciting, you can see it's happening right now.
And they decide to take power back in any way, you see their wickedness, their wickedness.
They will have no power or control over them, nor will We give them what they desire.
Democrat, he said, is on the mission to "stop and block."
"And you have seen it for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "wrath and evil and cruel and untrustworthy."
He referred to Senator Diane Feinstein as a member of the Senate Tradition Committee, calling his name, which was warmly welcomed by his audiences.
"Remember the answer?
Did you burn that document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for it--it's a very bad body language-- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a public service place.
Now he's being intolerant to anyone who reveals his thoughts.
When Momentum activists in my local party gave a voice to threaten me, it was not surprising.
After all, I was in the last order of Members of Parliament, who were told that our presence was not expected - all because we expressed opinions.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because he strongly defended anti-Semitism.
In my case, the riot movement criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, in Europe, the ironic issue that Jeremy Corbyn faced with earlier leaders.
An announcement to the Nottingham workers' meeting in the east on Friday said that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
For almost eight years I became a member of the local Labour Parliament, the meeting of the General Committee on Friday night was exactly that.
Unfortunately today, the qualities of many meetings and promises about policies that are "better, more friendly" have not been forgotten for a long time, if it did.
The differences in opinion in the working party are becoming more evident, and each opinion is valued by the authority of the party.
It began as soon as Jeremy became the leader, as a former colleague I thought would be able to share the same political view, began to expect me to turn around and accept the position that I would never have before - either in national security or in the single market of the European Union.
Whenever I talk openly and don’t care what I say, then I’ll be followed by attempts on social media that ask for a show-off, the politics of the center, and tell me I shouldn’t be working at the labor party.
And it wasn't just me who had it.
Of course, I know that I'm happier than some of my colleagues because of the comments addressed to me by the political tendency.
I admired my colleague’s professionalism and limitations, who faced sexual harassment or racism every day, but never did.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the political era is how reasonable the level of abuse has been.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed a week ago that the Labour Party was supposed to help develop tolerance culture.
The reality is that we are no longer in a larger church and with every "unbelievable" motion or change the party's choice of rules to be more limited.
I got a lot of advice over the past two years that moved me to keep my head down, not too much to express my opinion, and then I'll say, "Okay."
But I fell into politics not to do that.
Since I joined the Workers' Party 32 years ago when I was still a school student, challenged by thatcher's government tradition that caused my class of comprehensive schools to fall literally, I have tried to fight a better public service for those who really need it - both as a local council or a minister in the government.
I have never hidden my political actions, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham will question my policy position and things that I do not agree with in the leadership right now.
For those who encourage missions on Friday, which I can say is when the country moves quickly towards the Brexit division, it will endanger our country's business and public service, I don't want to waste time and energy on loyalty to the leader of the labor party.
But really, one of my messages is not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constitution, as a member of the labor party or not.

pages 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Fathers climb up to the top
The last two trials may have been a little detracting from the outcome, but no doubt the father deserves to win the tenent's Premiership which is very entertaining today.
Now they're in the top row, the only unbeatable side of ten.
Finally, their superior defenses, and the ability to get the best chances, which made the master team and Peter Murchie's coach have the right to feel comfortable.
"So far we've tried our game, and we're still not defeated so we're happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose says, "The respect for Father, they're better at taking the chance than we're doing."
Grant Anderson's experiment at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but the yellow card for Captain Scotland Rory Hughes, was given to the game by Warriors, giving Melrose the opportunity to print numbers and Jason Baggot the unconversioned tryouts.
Climo extended Ayr's leadership with a penalty, before, right in the middle of the time, he printed the goal then made a unique attempt to make Ayr's score 17-5 at a time of rest.
But Melrose began the second half well and the experiment with Patrick Anderson, which was modified by Baggot, reduced the chance to five points.
Then there was a long hunt because Ruarid Knott had a serious injury, was thrown out, and from the start of the game, Ayr went ahead faster than Stafford McDowall, modified by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson then hit the yellow card and again, Melrose made a backup player pay for Bruce Colvine's unchanged attempt at the end of the pressure.
The housekeeper has returned to play, but when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because of climo without a ball, from the line of guards, MacPherson arrived behind the wounded Ayr.
Climo is replaced, as it has been, almost since the start of the game, after Kyle Rowe did the tension and disrupted the fifth effort by Gregor Henry.
The Still Game star appears to be running a new career in the restaurant industry.
The star Still Game Kieran appears to be ready to move its way to the service industry as soon as it was previously known that he was built as a director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays at the BBC popular show, which was sponsored and built along with his former comedian partner, Greg Hemfill.
The couple already announced that the nine-year-old serial coming is the last episode, and it looks like Kiernan was planning to drive a commercial right after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he's Director Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a number of Scottish Suns pointed out that the Kirnan tried to get involved in the business of a growing restaurant in Glasgow.
“ The sea is ours: Bolivia, surrounded by the south, hopes that the court will return to the Pacific.
The crew did patrols at the large launch camp located in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a blue sea flag.
The Marine Corps from Titicaca to Amazon was polished with a motorcycle: "The sea is our right in law.
It's a duty to get back."
Through the south of Bolivia, memories of the loss of a beach line in a bloody 19th - century conflict still well up in Chile — a desire to conquer the Pacific once again.
That hope likely reached its peak in a few decades, because Bolivia was awaiting a hearing from the court on October 1, after a five - year confrontation.
"Bolivia has a moment, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course a positive hope for its results," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many of the Bolivians who will watch ICJ's judgment on a wide screen throughout the country hope that the court in Den Haag will support Bolivia's claim that - after a few decades of confrontation - Chile is obliged to assert the assurance of Bolivia's sovereignty over the sea.
Evo Morales, the privy president of Bolivia, who was charismatic about the controversial war for the next year's election - also had a lot of support for the verdicts on Monday.
"We are very close to the return of the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts are sure that the court can't decide what Bolivia wants - and it'll only change a little if it's possible.
The Netherlands-based United Nations has no power to surrender the territory of Chile, and has established that it will not decide the outcome of the comparison.
That ICJ's statement came only six months after the last argument was heard, which indicated that the case was "uncomplicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean international lawyer.
And still far from continuing Bolivia's claim, in the last four years, there may have been some relief.
"The problem of access to the sea is already behind the Bolivian government now," he said.
Aggressive rhetoric Morales has weakened the good label of the rest of Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will remain united at certain points, but it will be very difficult to keep talking after this.
Since 1962, two countries have not changed their trades.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of the Bolivian government of Den Haag, rejects the idea of making a decision quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open an era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of conflict of opinion with profit together," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales-is one of the most famous Latin American presidents to use the maritime issue as a political supporter.
Bolivia will never release its right to have access to the Pacific," she added.
"It's an opportunity to see what we need to do in the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons will not happen unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his first country would never break nuclear weapons if Korea could not trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He mentioned the United States making an agreement at a meeting in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comment appeared when the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompeo, appeared almost to begin nuclear diplomacy that had broken up for more than three months after meeting with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri says it's just a dream that by continuing to sanction and oppose the U.S. declaration of a Korean war settlement, North Korea will surrender.
Washington stands by to agree to that statement without Pyongyang making an effort to disarm the armed forces first.
Good Kim and President Donald Trump wanted to hold a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is seriously about the acknowledgement of the weapons warehouse that the country is the only way to secure its security.
Pompeo planned to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump
Paris mode show shows a lot of recent collections of heads up to the main road near you
If you want to increase the collection of hats or really want to be protected from sunlight don't look for any other.
Valentine's and Thom Browne designers released a large-scale cover series for their SS19 collection at stage show mode with fancy style held at Paris Fashion Week.
The really impractical hats have been cleaning Instagram this summer and these designers have been showing creations that are glamouring their eyes at the stage of the auction.
The famous thing about Valentine is a cream hat that's decorated with a wide-spread backdrop that covers the head of the model.
Large accessories, including diamond ornaments, witch hats, and even a swimmer, are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also showed a group of weird and right up to Halloween.
A lot of different color masks his lips have been painted and like Hannibal Lecter compared to high couture.
A creature that resembles an earthenware vessel is equipped with a snorkel and a glass of eyes, yet it looks like an ice-cream.
And if you keep listening to the fashion collection of those adverts-- then you're being honest.
Mode observers estimate that the large hat collection will be based on the main road near you.
The big hats become a very running train in the 'La Bomba', a rubber hat with a two-foot wide look on all the people including Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The label decoration of a very non-practice hat made of social media makes a large creation in the beach lanes of the horama which is almost identical to swimwear - worn with a flat model.
The burning raffia bag, cut with raffia on the edge with a white leather strap, is a great thing from the collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 in Paris Fashion Week.
The famous hairdresser Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I hope to see the big hat and beachbag coming on the main road for the next summer--because the designer has made a big impact, it will be difficult to ignore the request for the big accessory."
John Edward: Language skills are very important to the global population
The Scottish State School kept a record of the academic achievement, and this continued in 2018 with remarkable tests, which were strengthened by each student and by collective success in sports, art, music, and hard work.
With more than 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish School of School (SCIS) Board, work hard to provide the best service for students and parents.
Schools are designed to prepare their students for further and higher education, their career of choice, and their role as citizens of the world.
As a sector of education that can instruct and implement school curriculums as expected, we saw modern language continue to be popular and wanted in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in the language he understands, your speech will enter his head.
If you speak to him in his language, then your speech will enter into his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot depend only on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest results of this year’s exam, we can see that the language is the top league table position with the highest graduation level in high school.
A total of 68 percent of students learning a foreign language get the A Plus value.
The data was collected from 74 SCIS schools that showed that 72 percent of students received the A Plus value in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent who learned Spanish also received the A value.
This shows that schools in Scotland support foreign language as an important skill that children and adolescents will certainly need at the time of arrival.
Now languages, as a learning eye option, are held in the same standard as the STEM study (scientific, technological, resource and mathematics) in modern schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the English Ministry of Labour and Skills in 2014 found that for some reasons the employer had to keep fighting in the loop, 17 percent of the reason was that he lacked language skills.
As a result, language skills are increasingly being encouraged to prepare teenagers for their future careers.
By increasing the number of opportunities available to people to work in a language field, this ability is vital in a global world.
Whatever a person's career choices, if they've learned a second language, they'll feel real benefits in the future because they have such a life-long ability.
Being able to communicate directly with citizens of a foreign country will automatically make a superior multiplayer in competition.
According to YouTube's opinion on over 4,000 adult English in 2013, 75 percent of them don't speak foreign language well enough to make French speech and language the only language spoken in two percent, that is 15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning for children now is important for now.
Having multilingual ability, especially the language of nations with a growing economy, will equip children with a better opportunity to find a meaningful job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach the most important language in English for a few years to come, 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child, there will always be a number of languages that can be selected in high school, with teachers who are experts in this field.
Schools in Scotland are designed to provide an environment of study that will prepare children and disengage them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It can't be expected that at this point, in the global business environment, language will always be an important aspect of determining the future of the country, so this should be taught in education.
In fact, modern language must be regarded as a "international communication capability."
The high school will continue to offer choices, beliefs, and superiority to young people in Scotland.
It needs to be done well.
John Edward is the director of the School of Scotland.
LeBron is going to be debuting for Lakers on Sunday at San Diego.
Expecting fans to see LeBron James keep his debut for Los Angeles Lakers almost finished.
Coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening for the weekend against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is not yet determined how many minutes he will play.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell wrote a tweet that James is likely to play for a few minutes.
After this week’s initial training, James was asked about his plan for the six - game contests in the Lakers season.
"In my career stage right now, I don't need to do a pro-seat game to prepare," he said.
Common Trumpet in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump started a public campaign this evening at Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first public quarter of the five public quarter scheduled for next week, including a stop in some fun places involving Tennessee and Mississippi.
After it was insisted that the appeal was imposed so that he could elect the governor of the Supreme Court, Trump meant to build support for him for the general election of half the time coming because the Republic Party would risk losing control of Congress if the appeal was made in November.
How close is the common Trump in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch closely?
General Trump at Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 nights. ET tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch the general Trump in West Virginia through direct broadcasts on YouTube.
The possibility that Trump would discuss this week’s meeting for the Supreme Court of the British Kavanaugh, which is becoming increasingly tense after the allegations of sexual misconduct and the likelihood of the Senate’s failure, will be challenged until one week while the FBI investigates it.
But the main purpose of this public agenda is to help the Republican party to get some time in the face of the November general election.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign mentioned that five public closes this week aim to "support volunteers and supporters because the Republic's party is trying to protect and expand the majority they hold in Senate and DPR," according to Reuters.
"Conference control is very important for its agenda so that the president will as much as possible move to the parts of the country during the busy campaign season," said Trump campaign leader who refused to mention his name to Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena at Wheeling, the public is expected to present supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and pull the tape from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be a second trip to West Virginia in the last month, the country he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tried to help Patrick Morrisey, a West Virginia Senate candidate from the Republican Party, who was left behind in the wake of an opinion.
"There is no good sign for Morrisey that the president should come as an effort to improve his performance in the wake of his opinion," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team bravely defends its hope in a unique Sunday match
After three one-sided sessions, the foursome session Saturday afternoon is what might be needed in this Ryder Cup.
The momentary experiment is the concept of sports that is the result of a completely trusted encounter by players, and no one is more than this in competition.
Where do they think they're at right now?
"Before that, they were proud of six points and now four, so I think we thought they were a little bit of a moment," said Jordan Spieth, passing that day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of being proud of four points with twelve more games.
But America's team, like Spielth says, feels they have a little moment and they have a lot of things that can be exciting, except for the formation of Spielth and Justin Thomas playing together all day and each of them boasts three of the four points.
Speith has played fatally from tea area to green area and leads with skill.
The excitement of the moment of the march is getting stronger when it comes, making an important puncture to make a series of matches when he and Thomas lose two opponents.
The punching of her that beat them on the number 15 they received with a similar scream, the scream that told you that she was sure America was not lost.
"You really have to work harder and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
All these players have gone now.
18 holes to be marked.
The only player with points more than Spieth and Thomas for two days yesterday is Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, a story that's unquestionable from Ryder Cup.
A unique but attractive couple from Europe are four for four and can do without mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a bogey hit on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
That run, and how their energy seems to flow well to or from this vicious crowd that convinces them that they are the players to be defeated on Sundays, and there is no more famous player than Fleetwood or Molinari who will lock Europe's winning potential at sunset over Le Golf National.
It would be better if they were placed in a different hole at the same time.
But it's still too much to talk about Europe's victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson reduced the work of Sergio Garcia, a morning football hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the front of nine like digging holes that will never be able to be planted by Spanish golfers and this Swedish.
Although, on Sunday, no one can help you get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are a good show to be seen closer because of the interaction between the couple, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how strategies can change for a while.
So far, Europe plays better as a team and leads far enough to the final day, but the forum session also shows that the U.S. team has the power to compete despite suspicion by some parties, especially in the United States.
Europe's top 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit on the final day of Ryder Cup after getting up from the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday by leading 10-6 over the United States.
Two inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari lead with two victories over Tiger Woods who have to fight to record their points so far in Le Golf National with four points.
The European team Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to defend the throphy that was not found in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the wrong American team in the morning football, making this series a 3-1.
The United States provided more combat in foursomes, won two matches, but they could not reduce deficits.
Team Jim Furyk needs eight points of 12 single-day games on Sunday to defend the trophies.
Fleetwood was the first European debut to win four round points, while he and Molinari, who were hit by "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, were just the second couple to win four points from their four openings in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in their four-balls became very strong to defeat Woods that leaped and launched the American Bryson Dechambeau with a stronger 5&4.
Woods, who forced himself through two matches on Saturday, once a show of horror, but he had lost 19 of the 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven consecutively.
Justin Rose, resting at the fourball in the morning, then back to get together with Henrik Stenson in the forum and lose 2&1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koopka -- the one and the three worlds.
Europe did not reach it itself, even though the day was fun and bitter in western Paris.
The main winner three times Jordan Spielth and Justin Thomas set up a two-point rejection for America on Saturday.
They won 2&1 that attracted Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in fourball and then back again to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the forum after losing the first two holes.
It just happened twice in Ryder Cup history where a team came back from the four points deficit into a single game, although as a champion of the Fury team only needed a series of points to defend the trophies.
However, after becoming the second best for two days, the week’s return attack seemed to surpass them.
North Korea says 'no way' will kill weapons on the one hand without trust.
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea presented to the United Nations a series of sanctions that repeatedly undermined their trust in the United States and could not have been the country's nuclear-weapon-in-the-art in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of this world's annual body that North Korea had taken "significant steps to show good intentions" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, launching nuclear testing sites, and promising not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"Well, we didn't see any proper responses from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation we can't disarm our own weapons in the first place."
While Ri reiterates the same complaint from North Korea about Washington's resistance to the approach to "step" for the destruction of where North Korea will be punished for taking the step, a significant statement said that they did not reject completely as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri refers to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the summit between the United States president's office and North Korean leader who was first held in Singapore on 12 June, at which time Kim promised to try to "denuclearize the Korean side" while Trump promised North Korea security.
North Korea has officially wanted to claim the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must stop his nuclear weapon first.
Washington also refused a call to extend international sanctions to North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denomination earlier" and increases pressure with the provision of semi-performing sanctions to achieve their purpose strictly, and even rejects "the declaration of the end of war," Ri says.
"Perception that sanctions can make us kneel is the illusion of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that these continued sanctions will inflame our infidelity."
Ri didn't mention a plan for a second summit meeting between Kim and Trump, led by the United States leaders in the early United Nations this week.
The minister also attended three meetings between Kim and South Korean leaders Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the troubled party in this denuclearization is South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization on the Korean side will not find a way out of this."
However, Ri's speech is dramaticly different from last year's, when he spoke to the United Nations General Assembly that targeting North Korea's rockets in the South of the United States is something that cannot be avoided after "Mr. President of the Devil" Trump calls Kim "a rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year in a meeting of the United Nations, Trump the year ago threatened to "destruct" North Korea in total, immersing praise to Kim for his courage to take steps to break down, but the big job still needs to be done and sanctions must continue to be carried out until North Korea does denuclearize.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - no problem," he said.
Tsongkok and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should punish Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that: "The sanctions of the Security Council must be continued firmly and cannot fail until we know that full, final and verifiable denuclearization."
The Peace Council has been raising sanctions for North Korea since 2006 in an effort to halt nuclear programmes and Pyongyang ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri in the former U.S. General Council and said after that he was going to visit Pyongyang another month to prepare a second summit meeting.
Pompeo had visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that there was actually progress, only North Korea in the hourly count said that he himself made a "claim like a gangster."
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to disband the missile and also the nuclear complex if the United States took "decent action."
He said that Kim ordered him to do "just the right thing" with his wish was a security guarantee that Trump promised in Singapore and moved towards normalization of his relationship with Washington.
Harvard University took a course on enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all S1 students there sleep more, in an effort to combat macho culture in a study that is developing through 'a ghost bird' powered caffeine.
An academic found that students at the university number one world often don't know anything if they're discussing very basic things about how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep specialist at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed a course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start a course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleepless nights in the study.
"At last a certain girl came to me, saying, 'Why am I now made known to you, in the year of my death?'
The girl said no one ever told me about the importance of sleeping--which surprised me,' she said to The Telegraph.
The course that was first launched this year, explained to the students about the essence of how good sleep habits help the academics and athletes to improve their public health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health care at the university, said that the university decided to introduce this course after finding a student who had very little sleep all week.
Courses over an hour include a set of interactive tasks.
In one session there is a drawing of a room, where students click on coffee cupboards, drawers, sports pants, and books to get an explanation of the influence of caffeine and light bulbs, and how athletic results are influenced by sleep deprivation, and the importance of sleeptime routines.
On the other hand, participants have been told how long a lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A college map, with an interactive icon, then motivates participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know this won't change the student behavior in an instant.
But we're sure that they have the right to know--like the thing you have the right to know the effect of choosing to suck cigarettes on health,' grew Prof. Czeisler.
A culture proud of the 'sex' still exists, its atmosphere, plus that modern technology and increasing pressure on students that means a lack of sleep is a continuing problem.
Make sure you sleep enough, with good quality, you have to be 'secret weapons' to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety -- even to avoid weight gain, because a lack of sleep makes the brain activate the mode of hunger, triggers hunger.
Raymond So, 19 - year - old California, who studied chemistry and physics and who helped Professor Czeisler design the course, took one of his classes years ago during his first year at Harvard.
He said that this course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize a course for the entire college.
The next step, he hoped that the entire school would be instructed to complete a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof. Chzeisler recommended that students consider arranging sleep time alarms, including wake-up alarms, and realize the effects of the ‘blue light’ displayed by the electronic screen and LED lamps, which can speed up the rhythm of your circuit out of its orderly path, causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal to bring down Gerard's army mentality
Again, Rangers felt the day's sadness when the Dolly attack sent out Steven Gerrard's third-party team on 1-0 in Livingstone.
The Ibrox team has been trying to record their first victory on their way, since the 4-1 win in February at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team has just given Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as a manager, causing his team to leave eight points from the leader of the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts class.
To attack seven minutes before the first round is over and the smart rangers who have gone out of their way don't seem to balance.
While Rangers are now down to sixth position, Livingston goes up to third position, just left the empty set of hibernian.
And it could be that there will be further problems in the Rangers cave after the Calum Spence linekeeper has to be treated because the head injury after an object has been thrown away.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that put Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-final.
Instead, Holt went with the same Livi 11 who took one point from Hearts last week and he would be happy with the costumes that fanned their opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may dominate the owner of the ball, but Livingstone uses the ball they own better.
They were supposed to have scored in just two minutes when the first short bet was thrown by Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's cage, but the trigger attracted that big opportunity too wide.
The free trade of the Jacobs' Square inside met with Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner Alan Lithgow can only get wide into the back position.
Rangers take control, but there seems to be more hope than confidence in their games at the end of the third.
Alfredo Morelos must have felt that he was supposed to get a warrant when he and Steven Lawless were engaged on a fourth-hour mark but on Steven Thomson refused to ban the citizens of this country of Colombia.
Rangers only made two throws in the first bay but the Ibrox guard before, Liam Kelly, almost never had a problem with Lassana Coulibally's head beating and Ovie Ejaria's easy attack.
Although the goal of opening the Livi in the 34th minute may be contrary to the course of the competition, no one can deny that they deserve it because of their hard work.
Once again Rangers failed to overcome the deadly tactics of the inner Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher put the ball in Scott Robinson, who remained calm choosing To make a simple end.
Gerard took action when he retired by replacing Coulibally with Ryan Kent and the exchange gave direct influence when the wing player put the ball on Morelos, but Kelly who played the game was amazingly out of line to stand.
But Livingstone continued to force the field team to play the exact game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett squeezing all the long balls.
The Holt team was supposed to extend their superiority to the final stage, but McGregor stood up well to drive out Jacobs before Lithgow hopped wide from the corner.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, claimed more guards when he quarreled with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his face again.
Almanac: Discovery of Geiger’s Breakdown
And now from our Sunday Morning German page: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and there's a lot going on today... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger develops a method to detect and measure radioactivity, which is a discovery that eventually makes the device known as Geiger Breaker.
As a scientific tool since then, Geiger's break-up has also become a pop culture, like in the 1950s "Bells of Coronado," built by cowboy scientists who seem to have little faith in Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What's that thing?"
Rogers: "This is Geiger Breaking, used to find radioactive mineral sites, such as uranium.
When you use this earphone, you can actually hear the atomic effect released by the radioactive activity in the mineral."
Evans: "Tell me, it must be coming up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that kept his name alive.
The new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to 'know' the evil cell
The new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to 'know' the evil cell and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize evil cells as part of the cure
The method involves the process of extracting immune cells from the patient, converting it into a laboratory.
They can then 'know' the general protein on many cancers and then be suggested again.
A test vaccine shows the results of promises to patients with a variety of types of cancers.
A woman was treated with that vaccine, which taught the immune system to recognize the evil cell, her ovarian cancer had been missing for more than 18 months.
This method involves the patient's immune cell extraction process, transforms it into a laboratory so that they can "know" the proteins that are generally present in many cancers called HER2, and then resuscitating that cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the United States National Cancer Foundation in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "The result is that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "increasing some types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer, Prof. Berzofsky explains.
The same approach as taking patients' immune cells and teaching them how to target cancer cells has succeeded in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West started Diatribe Pro-Trump, wearing a MAGA hat, after his SNL performance.
Not a Good Walker
Kanye West was shot at a studio during Saturday Night Live after showing a mess where he praised President Donald Trump and said that he would cheer himself up in 2020.
After bringing the third song that night, the Ghost Town where he wore the Make America Great hat, he challenged the Democratic party and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I used to talk to white people and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Yeah, if I'm worried about racism, I've been out of America for a long time," he said.
SNL started a show with a sand dune named Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's witness in front of the Senate Judical Committee on the allegations of sexual violence by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, the record of the West is founded on social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock is trying to make fun of the West with that equation.
Also, West complained to the viewers that he had trouble at the back of the stage because of the hat he wore.
"They're hiding me behind the stage.
They said, 'Don't go out wearing that hat.'
They're hiding me!
And then they say I'm drowning," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West goes on, "Do you want to see the sink?" she says she's going to wear the Superman dress, because this means you can't tell me what to do.
Try to love."
His comment generated at least twice of the viewers and the SNL performance seems to be embarrassing, Variety reported, with one person saying, "A whole silent studio."
West was brought in the last few moments as a substitute for Ariana Grande, former rap singer Mac Miller who just died a few days ago.
West confused a lot of people with the look of the song I Love it, dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from the conservative TPUSA leader, Candace Turner, who wrote tweets: "For one of the bravest souls: HE IS LOVED TO BE A KIND OF REQUEST."
But the director of Karen Hunter's show wrote a tweet that West was just "being himself and it was really very good."
"But I chose not to present a person (by buying music or his clothes or supporting his "art") that I believed in and challenged the ideology that was dangerous to my community.
He's free.
So do we," he added.
Before the show, the rap singer announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, said that he is now "a man officially known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's tracks, he's also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
With rap singer, Snoop Dogg got the name Snoop Lion and must have turned the legend of Prince, turned his name into a symbol and then an artist previously known as Prince.
Demand for attempted murder at the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was beaten at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened at Ballyhackamore, police say.
The judge was expected to appear before the Belfast State Court on Monday.
This charge will be investigated by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
The Star Game of Thrones Kit Harington criticises poison masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his swordfighting role as Jon Snow in the middle-century fantasy series full of HBO Game of Thrones.
But this actor, 31 against the macho hero stereotype, he said that the role on the screen of that kind of makes young boys often feel that they should be strong to respect.
Talking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit says he's sure there's something wrong and questions how to deal with a bad masculinity problem in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who just got married to her toy at the Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that she felt 'strong enough' in discussing the issue.
'I feel personal, strong enough, right now--where's our fault in this masculinity thing?' he said.
'What do we teach men when we grow up, the problems we see now?'
Kit believes television may be responsible for the appearance of bad masculinity with its very masculinity characters.
He goes on to say, 'Is that a character since birth and what is taught?
What was taught on TV, and on the street, which made the boys feel that they should have this particular side to be men?
I think it's really one of the big questions at the time - how do we change it?
Because there's clearly something wrong with the young.'
In that interview he also admitted that he was not going to play in the store or the game of Thrones at the end of the summer coming, saying that he had already ended up in the field of war and horses.
Since November Kit's been calling back True West from Sam Shepard, that's the story of the film producer and his brother, who was a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considered meeting with his wife Rose as the best reason to get out of the Game of Thrones.
'I meet my wife in this show, so give me the future family, and from here my life begins' his words.
Rose played Ygritte, the character-loving flower of Jon Snow, in the series of fantasy winners of this Emma's appreciation.
This couple got married in June 2018 in the home of Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: Achieved reports 14% of new cases
Tinkkok has announced 14% of its population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people were displaced in this country, said the health officer.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases were made through sex, marked changes from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through several parts of Tigkok as a result of blood transfusions.
However, the number of people living HIV in this way has decreased to nearly zero, the health care officer Tiongkok said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in Tiongkok has increased to 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the LGBT Tigkok community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in Tiongkok in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is becoming more important.
Because of the conservative value of this country, the study estimated that 70-90% of men who had sexual relations with men would eventually marry women.
Many cases of sexually transmitted diseases are caused by improper sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Tingkok government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters objected that the staff had burned down the data of the GOP senator, spreading 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theory'.
The U.S. Attorney Maxine Waters on Saturday protested that one of his staff had sent personal information to three senators of the United States Party to the Web site of the parliamentary member.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party insisted that the claim was motivated by experts and the Ultra-Rightwing website.
"A lie, a lie, and a lot more evil lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
It's reported that direct information includes the address and phone number of the United States Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all of them from Utah.
That information appeared on Thursday, sent by unknown people at the Capitol Hill during the Senate panel meeting on the unscrupulous charges of sexual misconduct against the High Court of the United Kingdom of Kavanaugh.
It appeared shortly after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the IP address that identifies the source of the shipment is connected to the Waters office and discloses information from one of the Waters staff members, Hill reports.
"The unwarranted accusation is really wrong and is an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My staff member -- who is an identity, personal information, and his well-being is threatened by a false and false accusation -- is not responsible for the leak of this information at all.
It's not really a lie, and it's an absolute lie.
Waters quickly attracted criticism, including from former Press Secretary of the White Building Ari Fleischer.
"This resistance means anger," Flescher wrote.
"This shows he doesn't fit to be a Congressman.
If someone is accused of something that he does not do, they should not be angry.
They can't get away with it.
They cannot question the motives of the accused.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to democratic criticism of the Kavanaugh Judge, who accused critics of being too angry during the Thursday congregation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to push Waters at the mid-term election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it's true," it says on Twitter.
In his statement, Water said his office had warned "the right authority and law enforcement entities about this false accusation.
"We'll make sure that the perpetrators will be arrested," he said, "and they'll be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to one of my staff and all my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again - a parody of poor Roman Atkinson's eyeballs
Now looking for the significance of Brexit in every new movie with the British standard view has become a tradition and it seems to be happening to relaunch Johnny English comedy paralogues -- which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the sarcastic sarcasm tell us how bad it is that we become a new export opportunity for this country?
Anyway, Johnny English, who looks like a bullet, a karet face, and the non-competent has updated his license to mess things up for the second time--his name gives more than anything that he's a vast comical creation designed for the English-language cinema area.
Of course, he was a crazy secret agent who, left out of his strange suspicion, had a little Clouseau character, by the character of Mr. Bean and a group of travelers who contributed little notes to the theme Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
Indeed, he is based on a visitor and a mysterious international man who has ever played Atkinson on a Barclaycard TV advertisement that is now forgotten, leaving a mess behind him.
There's one or two sweet moments on the latest Je.
I liked Johnny English approaching the helicopter by wearing a mid-century red dress and rotating wheels with a quick grip on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy was shown, but his humor felt less powerful and too strange, especially when the film brand "serious" like 007 and Mission Ness believed to insert comedy as a substance.
It felt like it was intended for children from adults, and for me various weird, unscrupulous Johnny English jokes and the attention of Atkinson's jokes in Bean's personality.
The hot prize these years is that England is in serious trouble.
A cyber player has entered the British super-secret spy web network, revealing the identity of all the British agents in the field, to disappoint the agent in charge - unfortunately only a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for a proud and hostile prime minister, who has destroyed his entire political population: Emma Thompson acted very well with almost Teresa-May but not much to be asked of.
His wise counselor gave information that because every active spy was weakened, he had to bring one out of retirement time.
And that means Johnny English himself, now employed as the head of school in some great buildings, but gave a secret lesson about how to do a funeral operation: there are some good jokes here, when English offers a college of spy like School of Rock.
English is returned to Whitehall for emergency treatment and is again united with a long-standing friend who has suffered from Bough, again commissioned by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, riding a submarine commander, a top-class woman who's a little evicted from Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin, who made a mistake at the High Secret Agent, reacted, met the beautiful mysterious woman of Ophelia Bulletto, who was founded by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister was worried about falling into the influence of millions of charismatic technologies that admitted could solve the English computer problem: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough started their ridiculous adventure: enlisting as a servant, they burned a fast-paced French restaurant; they made a mess by sneaking around on Volta's luxury ship; and English launched anarchy when he tried to use the Virtual Reality headset to satisfy himself with the interior of Volta's home.
All the stops must have been attracted to the last sequence, but with the confusion and doubts like that, there's a few children's TV channels full of all of them.
That's quite modest.
And as the other Johnny English film, I can't think of it: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
Work is planning a plan for British citizens to work four days a week but paid five days
Jeremy Corbyn, from the United States, considered a radical plan that required British citizens to work four days a week but paid five days.
It is reported that the owners of the company will continue to produce relief products through the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) for workers by providing them with additional holidays.
He will allow the workers to enjoy the final three days of the week, but he will continue to receive the same rewards.
Some sources say that the idea would be 'pass' with the party's economic agenda and the plan moved the country to support the workers.
Changes to four days a week have been approved by the British Congress as a way for workers to experience the benefits of economic change.
A source, the senior of the Labour Force, told The Sunday Times: 'The conclusion on this policy is expected to be announced before the end of this year.
'This is not going to happen in the evening, but four days of work in a week is an aspiration that fits the party's approach to rebalancing the economy that supports the workers and the industry's strategy as a whole.'
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, because the Green Party has promised four days of work in a week on the general election campaign in 2017.
However, at this point, the aspirations were not supported by the entire Labour Party.
The jury said, "Working days in a week isn't party policy and is not being considered by the party."
Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to complete his vision of the socialist revolution in economics.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from the "anonymous director" and "prisoners" in utility companies.
This shadow chancellor also means, the stockholder at this moment in a drinking water company may not get the whole stock back because the government of the labor party can do 'discharge' with the reason for the breach.
He also made sure his plan to put workers in the company hall and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund that will give 10 percent of the company's equity in the private sector to employees, which will increase the annual dividend to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 minutes" whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed his final appeal at the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises questions as to whether this finding could affect the senators of the Republic Party to withdraw their support.
In the interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley's "60 Minutes" correspondent asked Senator of the Republic Party. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, could the FBI find something that could make them change their minds.
Looks like Kennedy's more open than his brother in South Carolina.
"My point, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I would attend the trial, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this incident, and the charge came up, and he said, "Are you doing it?
He's a strong man, determined, determined."
However, it seems that Graham’s voice could not be changed.
"My mind has made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and it takes a bigger charge to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but what I know is: Brett objected strongly," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he called his name can't verify it.
She's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What does it mean to be a Global Citizen Festival, and what has this event done to prevent poverty?
This Saturday, New York will be holding the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music show that features spectacular stars, and an effective mission; ending poverty in the world.
Now, in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will be a witness to tens of thousands of people coming to Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the actions of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the purpose of this event that was actually ending extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a follow-up to the Global Poverty Project, a group of international lawyers who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay a VIP ticket), the concert visitor must complete a set of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to world leaders, calling, or other means to help increase their awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in reaching its goal for 12 years?
Is the idea of giving a gift as a free concert is the right way to invite people to act, or is it just another case called "clickivism" - people feel like they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, moving to set another purpose.
It has been said that this action has helped the world's leaders to announce a commitment and policy equivalent to over $37 billion that will affect more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, this group has collected 390 commitments and announcements from their actions, at least $10 billion of which has been allocated or disbursemented.
This group has estimated that the peace fund has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments, among others The Power of Nutrition, are based on the English-based regime that consists of investors and producers committed to "help children grow up to their maximum potential," promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help end the country's Gigi deficit after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, the founder, the national government, and the Global Citizen like you, we can make social injustices about this lack of teeth become a record of history," said The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman told a group of people at a concert in London in April 2018.
This group also said that after more than 5,000 actions to increase nutrition for mothers and children in England, the government announced funds for a project, Power of Nutrition, which would cost 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Answering one of the questions at the Public Answers Question on their website that asks "What makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen said, "This will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But just like the civil rights movement and the great anti-apartheid that existed before us, we will succeed, because if we unite we will be stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the stars displayed on this year's New York event, which will be watched by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US can use the Navy as "blocked" to slow down the export of Russian energy - Secretary of State
"If necessary" Washington could ask the Navy for assistance in preventing Russian energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, Secretary of State, Ryan Zinke, as stated by Washington Examiner.
Zinke strongly believed that Russian involvement in Syria, where he operated on a legitimate government invitation, was a means of exploring a new energy market.
"I'm sure the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to be energy brokers, just as they do in Eastern Europe, southern Europe," he reported.
And, according to that office, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has that ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the seaways are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy cannot enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke in front of the actors at the concert held by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a niral group that called himself "a voice of energy" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach in agreement with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of efficiency, they are the same.
"The less economic choices in Iran and Russia are, the more useful and replaced the fuel," he said, calling Russia one of the "members in the field" with the economy based on fossil fuels.
This statement appeared when Trump's government trial was conducting a mission in order to increase their natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, with a much cheaper choice for Europe's customers.
To that end, Trump's government officials, including President Donald Trump himself, were trying to entice Germany to withdraw from the North Stream 2 "undeserved" oil pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "prison" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream oil pipeline 2 worth $11 billion, designed to reflect the oil pipeline capacity of up to 110 billion cubic meters, is a clean economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fight against this project is only motivated by economic reasons and is an unfair example of competition.
"I am sure we have the same view that energy cannot be made a tool to exert pressure and that customers must be able to choose their own way," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This US attitude has attracted the reaction of Germany, which has reaffirmed their commitment to this project.
The German Federation of German Industries (BDI) has asked the US not to interfere with the European Union's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I will face a major problem if the third country blends our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "deserve the situation" when she is serving as president in 2020, Senator Massachusetts said
On Saturday, Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said that he would "watch the situation" when he promoted himself as president after a half-time election.
When he was campaigning at the city hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren insisted he would consider encouraging himself.
"After the time for women to go to Washington and fix our shady government, including putting women in a position on the top," he told The Hill.
"After November 6th, I'm going to see the situation when I'm making myself president."
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump when campaigning at the city hall, saying that he "carried this region in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump did to our democracy," he said.
Warren's face-to-face in presenting his criticism of Trump and the leadership of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
On a Friday tweet, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we make a sound call."
However, a well - founded opinion on Thursday showed that most of Warren's constitution itself did not want him to make a dedication to 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the elective "possible" in Massachusetts said the senator should not hesitate, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe's opinion.
32 percent support those efforts.
That led to more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 percent who supported the possibility of empathizing with him and 48 percent who opposed him.
Other important names in the Democratic Party that were discussed with regard to the possibility of embezzlement in 2020 include former Deputy Prime Minister Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd officially decide on it in January, Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin sent PTSD Track Palin on the Donald Trump campaign
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after entering the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with violence in the house on Saturday night.
"What happened to my son, what will happen to him when he comes back, I can connect with other families who also feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries that we suffered from our army," he said in front of the audience in the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his arrest as "in the room" and related about his son and other war veterans, "they returned with a little different, they returned with more hard, they returned and wondered if there was any respect for what they had given, together with the soldiers and the refugees and every other military member to the country."
He was arrested on Monday at Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, added with reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons in drunken state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 countries in part, D.C. supports the challenge of new asylum policies
Eighteen countries and the District of Columbia support the challenge of law against a new U.S. policy that rejects harassment for victims who flee from gangs or domestic violence.
The trial of 18 states and districts has sent a friend-of-the-court letter on Friday in Washington to support the riot searchers in challenging the policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of Grace v. In the session's challenge called American Civil Liberties Union in August has not yet been revealed against federal politics.
He said his brother "and his son, who is a cruel gang member," had offended him, but the US officials refused his plea on July 20th.
He was arrested in Texas.
The country's power supporting Grace describes El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produces a large number of plumbers for the United States, as a country facing major gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. policy was based on the decision of the Immigration Council of 2014, which allowed dark immigrants who fled from domestic violence to appeal to the refugees.
The District Attorney General, Karl Racine, in a statement on Friday, said that this new policy "is ignoring the laws of the state, federal, and international that have been in existence for several decades."
"Federal law insists that all suction claims must be decided on the basis of certain facts and conditions related to the claim, and that prohibition violates the principles," the friend-of-the-court letter said.
Furthermore, the evidence briefly suggests that the policies that refuse to join the immigration undermine the US economy, says that they are likely to be entrepreneurs and "including the necessary labour force."
The Chief Justice Jeff Sessions, in June, ordered the immigration judge not to give any more impetus to the victims who fled from domestic violence and gang violence.
"They are available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear caused by racial, religious, national, or social group membership, or certain political opinions," Sessions said in a statement of this policy on 11 June.
It's not meant to ease all the problems -- although all the problems are serious -- that people face every day around the world.
A very sad rescue in Palu because of a double sacrifice as it ran in time to find a survivor
For those who have survived, the situation is getting worse.
"It was a great relief," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, calmed her boy's baby who was in the middle of a refugee camp in the city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes bringing the body.
Clean water is very rare."
The people are looking back at their ruined homes, taking things that are soaked with water, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and treated in a hospital, damage caused by an earthquake of 7.5, very severe.
Some of them were injured, including the two Haris, who suffered from bone fractures and shoulders, lying outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside the room because of a severe convulsions.
Her tears flowed as she recounted her feelings again when the earthquake broke down her five-bedroom hotel room and stayed with her wife and daughter.
"It's not easy to save yourself.
I think I'm stuck down the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, he added his family to the city to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry, please, and then shut up.
I didn’t know what it was like for me and my son.
May they be safe."
The U.S. Army accused Tsongkok of 'intimidating' with 'advertising advertising'
A week after Tiongkok's official newspaper posted a four-page advertisement on an American day that called the profits of the U.S.-Tiongkok trading force, the U.S. high court for Tiongkok accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to China’s Daily pay supplement at Des Moines Register - the most widely distributed newspaper in the country of Iowa - after Tiongkok’s accusations attempted to interfere with the U.S. Congress elections on November 6, a charge filed by Tiongkok.
Trump's claim that Beijing is trying to interfere with the U.S. election, which marks what the U.S. office says to Reuters, is a new phase in the expansion of Washington's campaign to press Tiongkok.
Although something is common for foreign governments to place advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an increasing trade war, which has led them to increase the rate of imports among themselves.
The price of Tikongkok's compensation at the beginning of this war was designed to attack exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party, says Tikongkok and US experts.
Terry Branstad, the great US ambassador for Tiongkok and former governor-in-chief of Iowa, export major farm goods to Tiongkok, says Beijing has lost workers, farmers, and businessmen in America.
Tikongkok, Branstad wrote an opinion at the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now exacerbate the intimidation by running an advertisement on our own free media."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Tiongkok government has benefited from the tradition of freedom of speech and that of the press that is highly appreciated in the Americas by charging ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
"On the contrary, in the kiosks of the street newspaper here, in Beijing, you will find a ban on voices different and will not see the actual celebration of the different views that may be held by Tinkkok people about the troubled economic transition, in memory of the media under the control of the Tinkkok Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent media in Tigkok refused offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which newspaper.
Reviewing the Republika S.A. With the Kavanaugh disaster, the Republic Party withdrew from women’s election to the mid - 1990 ’ s
Because the image of the important people on the Republican Party standing and defending the leadership of the United Kingdom Supreme Court of Kavanaugh in the face of some allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned that they will see the back attack, especially from women, in the general election of the next half-time.
The emotion of this problem is very high, and most members of the Republican Party have already shown that they want to move on to the sound field.
It's impossible," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School, Syracuse University, told The Hill about an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he suspected the senator's move (R-Arizona) Jeff Flake in the minutes of the end to do FBI research would be enough to slow down the election.
"Won't forget what happened yesterday--they won't forget it tomorrow, and they won't forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and jury speaker for the progressive MoveOn group said on Friday, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters shouted "November is close!" when they performed demonstrations at the Senate hall when the Republican Party controlled the Judicial Committee to continue progressing in the Kavanaugh petition, released from the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Anturiasm and the motivation of democracy will emerge from the list," political analysis not party to Stu Rothenberg, told the news site.
"People say it's high enough; and it's true.
But it can be even higher, especially among women's voters in the younger polling and election areas, 18 to 29 years old, who, because they don't like the president, often don't give a voice."
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which specifically explained sexual harassment against him by the Supreme Court’s commanding officer, the analysis suggested that there would be a subsequent attack if the Republican Party continued to force him to move forward with confirmation.
"This is a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former head of the National Committee of the Republic, early last week, to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's election or the final voice election or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the stand, it's also about how the Republican Party manages this problem and how they do it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to select a Democratic Party, points to the news channel.
But the Americans would seem to be divided about who to be trusted after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly more reliable choice for the last.
A new opinion sheet by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents really believe or maybe believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they really believe or maybe believe in Kavanaugh.
Besides, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh might or really lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After the move from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford and another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford testified under oath in front of the Senate Trial Committee that Kavanaugh, who was drunk, had attacked him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez said that the High Court's chalon showed him his affection when they attended a party while they were in Yale in the 1980s.
Web Browsers World Wide Web Scheduled to Start New Internet to Meet Google and Facebook
The Berners-Lee team, the World Wide Web fan, launched a Facebook, Amazon, and Google startup.
The latest project the legend of this technology, Inrupt, is a company built from the open-source platform Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and whoever is allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, while joking Berners-Lee said that the meaning behind the Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to start now," she said from the start.
"This is a historic moment."
This application uses Solid technology that allows people to create "save private online data" or their own PODs.
This storage can include a list of contacts, a list of tasks, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about storing this personal online data is that it really depends on the user who can access what kind of information.
In the company it's known as "personal intelligence through data."
The idea to establish the Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company has the resources, processes, and ability to help to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is now made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, some of the staff developers who are opposed to operating projects, and the code-maker volunteer community.
Starting this week, technology development worldwide can make decentralization applications themselves using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team didn't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce or not a total change where all their business models would really be reversed last night.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post in the Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt mission is to provide energy and commercial ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has become a voice that has an impact on the neutrality of the network debate.
Even when the Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will remain the Director and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next web era," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 wave alarmed Victoria Cross
The only mayor of the Church in England who won Victoria Cross during World War I as a warrior, was remembered in the land of his birth 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Revend, Bernard Vann, won the award on September 29, 1918, for the attack in Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a single shooter and never knew that he had won the highest military honor of England.
A warning stone directed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said this was a "scientific symbol" stone that would reveal exactly 100 years of Grandfather's achievement won appreciation.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "pulling a very heavy straw under a firefight from the field weapon and machine."
Then he rushed forward to the time line and with "greater courage" led the front line before hurrying to use the weapons of the field alone and bridging three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German shooter on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, says his grandfather's action is "something I know I can't live but it's a very humble act."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed flowers after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very fond of playing in this parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is being shown with the support that many will give."
MMA fans spent the night watching Bellator 206, but they even got Peppa Pig
Imagine, you've spent a night watching Bellator 206 full of urgency just to refuse to watch the main event.
San Jose's shop has 13 matches, including six on the main card and is being screened directly all night in England at Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., right when the Ggard Mousesi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready for each other, the viewers in England were shocked when their lips turned into Peppa Pig.
Some people feel unappreciated after they get back to this special day for the fight.
A Twitter fan describes the change to children's cartoons as a "violent joke."
"This is the rule of the government, that at 6 p.m. the content is not appropriate to be displayed, so that it is replaced by the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, senior president of the assembly and communication Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa's dad," yes."
The president of Bellator Scott Coker's company said they'd fix their schedule by counting the viewers in England at the time.
"Informed me, if we think about re-launching, I think we might be able to complete it," said Coker.
"But right now there at six o'clock in the morning and we won't be able to fix it until the day of our week, the afternoon of their time.
But we are doing our best.
Trust me, at the time of the change, a lot of back-to-back texts and everything doesn't teach.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical mistake.
No, it's a government problem.
Trust me, that will never happen again.
We're going to reduce to only five fights from six fights -- as we usually do -- and we're going to try to avoid excessive temptation for fans, and we're going to make it.
It's unfavourable."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'slow' related to sexuality
The Olympic explorer Tom Daley said he grew up with low self-esteem because of his sexuality -- but it gave him motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old man said he didn't realize it until he went to high school, that "not everyone like me."
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs brought by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of gays to give "hope" to others.
He also said that being an old man makes him less concerned with winning the Olympics.
The usual performer brought this long walk, Kirsty Young, taking off for a few months because of the disease.
Looking like the evicted people on the first Laverne program, Daley said he felt "less than" all the other people who grew up with him because "don't get what you can socially to like men and women."
He said, “To this day your feelings are different from those of others, and your feelings have become clear to me, so that I may attain success.”
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't let everyone know when they knew about his sexuality problem.
The two medals of the Olympics have become the famous LGBT campaign leader and used his appearance at Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to attract more countries to avoid discrimination against homosexuals.
He said he was talking because he felt lucky to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world champion three times said he fell in love with a filmmaker from the United States Dustin Lance Black, who was found in 2013 -- "surprising me."
Daley married an Oscar who was 20 years older than she was last year, and she said that age is not a problem.
"When you have so many problems at a very young age"--he followed his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later--he said it was very difficult to find someone of the same age who had the same e-mail.
The couple have become parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says "all his perspectives" have changed.
"If you ask me a year ago, all of a sudden 'I have to win the gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there's something bigger than just winning the Olympic gold medal.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they got a ticket for the London 2012 Olympics - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I can't tell him 'You won't sit on the front row of your father," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and still didn't really stop breathing until he died, I finally admitted that he wasn't defeated," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the championship.
"What I know is, this is what I've been focusing on all my life--to drown in front of the crowd at the Olympics, there's no better feeling than that," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Proud by Heather Small - that has joined him in his preparations for the Olympics and still makes him faint.
Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 broadcast on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson changed his role when proposed on Ryder Cup on Saturday
U.S. Officer Phil Mickelson will record the record on Sunday when he played the 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to change his role to avoid unpleasant achievement.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event to record the 12th record, was suggested by Captain Jim Furyk for a four-ball game and group four on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of action, as he usually did for the United States, the main winner this five times divided the time between being a cheerleader and doing his game on that stage, with hope to fix what made him trouble.
Never become the most direct golfer at the top of his career, this 48-year-old man doesn't fit to follow a very tight course at Le Golf National, which routinely gives a long and harsh punishment for every wrong shot.
And for his own field, it wasn't scary enough for Mikkelson, in a nine-day game on Sunday, to meet the very exact English champion Francesco Molinari, who has worked with the new arrival Tommy Fleetwood to win all of their four matches this week.
If this American player starts 12 single games with four points below, starts with a hot start, then the Mickelson game will prove very important.
Fury expressed his confidence in this man, not because he could say many other things.
"He really understands his role today, turns his back and embraces me, and says he'll be ready for the game tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He's so confident.
He was Hall of Famer and he gave so much on this team last week, and this week.
Maybe I can't imagine him playing two games.
I pictured others, but that was the way they were playing, and that was the way we thought we should go.
He wants to enjoy another atmosphere, just like most people."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most played Ryder Cup game on Sunday.
It can mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup that will never match his individual record height.
Mickelson scored 18 victories, 20 defeats, and seven series, although Furyk said his presence brought some things he could not say on the team.
"He's funny, he's hot, he's hot, he's hot, he likes people to joke, and he's cool in the team room," he explains.
"I think the younger player had fun with her, too, this week, which is quite fun to see.
He's given a lot of things, more than playing."
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great power can soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, Captain of Europe, learned from experience that someone who led quite a large way to his last single match at Ryder Cup could easily become an unpleasant journey.
Dane did his first debut at the 1997 Valderrama game, with the captain of the Seven Ballesteros team holding five points over America, but just touched the finish line with their nose with the smallest margin, winning 141 1⁄2-131/2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we get great superiority in Valderrama; we get great superiority in Brooklyn, where we lose, and in Valderrama, where we win, but only recently," said Bjorn, taking pictures, after watching Class of 2018, won 5-3 good on Friday and yesterday by leading 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you'll enter a really boring game.
Go out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you get a point on the writing board.
We have a target, and the target is to win this trophy, and that's the focus.
I've been saying for a long time, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we're also very aware of what's on the other side -- the greatest players in the world."
Glad to see the players playing in the hard golf field, Bjorn added, "In this thing I will never go on my own.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, the individual player will progress, and this is the different thing to do.
It's nice to be out there with a friend if everything goes well, but if you're out there playing individually, then your ability as a golfer will be tested.
That's the message you have to tell all the players, get the best out of yourself for the game tomorrow.
Now, you leave your friend and he must go to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk would ask his player to play better individually than they did as a pair, except for Jordan Spielth and Justin Thomas, who won three of the four points.
The force itself has been on the two ends of the last round of that big game day, has been part of the team that won in Brooklyn before the end of the defeat of Europe by performing the "Miracles in the Medina."
"I remember all those words," he said, answering the question how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, united his players to the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start it fast as you see in Brooklyn, as you see in Medina.
When the moment goes one way, it will give a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We've also arranged a list of players and put people in various ways that we think, you know, we're trying to do miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to try to lead the fight against Rory McIlroy at the top, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, the other European players on the top row.
"I went with this group of people in a row like this because I think I can close all the way," said Bjorn about his only choice.
The new German warship is delayed.
The German Navy's newest watchman was supposed to be working in 2014 to replace the old Cold War warship, but it won't be there until at least the next year because of the wrong system and its rising cost, local media reports.
The mission "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg guardship, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which directs military speech.
The ship was supposed to be connected to the Navy in 2014, but the issue of shipping passports had disrupted the fate of this ambitious project.
The fourth Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship to be notified to the Marine Corps in 2007 will be replaced by an old Bremen class guard.
This ship will be equipped with powerful minerals, an array of anti-aircraft missiles, and anti-shipcraft missiles, as well as some advanced technologies, such as radar removal, infrared, and acoustic keys.
Other important features, including the extended period of care, were the use of the modern - day Watch Tower Society for two years from its original port.
However, the landing continually means this great warship -- which is said to allow Germany to highlight its power abroad -- will be delayed at the beginning of its task time, the Die Zeit recorded.
A bad fateful F125 guard ship was announced last year, when the German Navy officially refused to place the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss bay in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the ship’s shipyard after shipping.
Only a few reasons are known behind the ship's return, but the German media reported a number of "hardware and hardware" that make the warship useless when used for the war mission.
The lack of software is very important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - only half of the work force on the older Bremen class.
It is also known that the ship’s boat would be far too much to reduce its engine and limit the capacity of the Navy to add to the update in time to come.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" with this 7,000-ton bobot is convinced twice as much of the same class as Germany used in World War II.
In addition to broken hardware, the cost of production of all the projects — including ship training — is also a problem.
It's said to go up to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) -- up from the beginning of €2.2 billion.
The problem of retaining the latest guard ship became very important to remember the latest warning because of the torture of the German naval forces.
Early this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy actually "ends of the ship with extensive capacity."
The officer said that the time of this problem is growing, because old ships are no longer in use, but there are no replacement ships available.
He apologized that not one of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class guards could join the Navy.
National Trust listens secretly to the secret life of a stranger
A recent research has been done at a farm in the Highlands of Scotland, which aims to reveal how the glaucoma is used in their food hunts.
It is expected that this finding will provide new light on the behavior of this unique flying mammals and will help guide conservation activities in the coming days.
This study by scientists in the National Trust for Scotland will be followed by a general, soprano, and long-acting chocolate potion and Daubenton in the Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
A special set will be placed in the main location around the property to track cloud activities throughout the year.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also perform a cell phone survey using a pulse detector.
The sound expert who analyzes all the recordings will ensure the frequency of the call and the species doing what activity.
Then the map and the habitat report will be made to take pictures with a detailed scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation counselor for NTS, hopes this will reveal which habitat area is most important for the deaf and how each species uses it.
This information will help determine the benefits of the habitat management work, such as the cultivation of vegetation and the best way to preserve the forest for floodwaters and other related species.
The populace in Scotland and throughout England has been steeply down in the last few centuries.
It is threatened by the construction and development work that affects the environment and the habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose risks, such as stick paper hung to trap the hatchery and chemical treatment of the building, as well as attacks by the cat.
Actually, it's not blind.
However, because of his habit of hunting at night, his ears were more useful than his eyes in catching victims.
They're using high-end gem location techniques to track insects correctly and prevent them from flying.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land across the country, is of great concern to the outback.
They have ten trained personnel, who regularly carry out inspections, checkouts, and sometimes try to save.
This organization has also set up the first and only natural waters in Scotland in the Thrave farm in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of seabirds in Scotland.
David Thompson's farm manager said the farm was a suitable area for the sheep.
"Here in Treve, we have a good area for the gateway," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees, and all good habitats.
But there's still a lot we don't know about the tunnels, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand more about what they need to develop."
He stressed the importance of checking the hatchery before doing maintenance in the property, because without realizing the possibility of the destruction of a single hatchery could kill up to 400 female and still small hatcheries, which might destroy the entire local population.
The snake is protected, killed, raped, or disturbed, or destroyed by the snake is an illegal act.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scotland’s Preservation Officer, encouraged the public to come and help.
He said, "We still need to learn a lot about our cubs and for many of our species that we don't know how their population's fate is."
Ronaldo, who rejected the charge of rape, is preparing a lawyer for the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo referred to the claim of self-defense as "false news," and said that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyer would challenge the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the charge.
The Portuguese and Juventus were accused of rape by an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was then supposed to have paid it by giving $375.000 to keep his mouth shut about this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Talking in a video The Instagram News to 142 million followers a few hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33 years old, threatened the report as "false news."
"No, no, no, no.
What they say today is false news," the winner of Ballon d'Or five times said it to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's the usual thing.
They want to be known by calling my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added with a smile.
Prosecutor Ronaldo is preparing to challenge Der Spiegel on the charge, which they call a "report of suspicion in the private sector that cannot be accepted," according to Reuters.
The Christian Schertz lawyer said he would ask for compensation as "for moral damage in a number of ways appropriate to those violations, which may be one of the most serious personal rights violations in the last few years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reported back to the player's room, where he was supposed to have raped him, according to a report sent to the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo kneeled after an incident that was charged and told him that "99 percent" he was a "good man" that disappointed only "one percent."
The document says that Ronaldo allowed both of them to have sex, but it was based on desire together.
Mayorga also said she went to the police office and had made a visa for her injuries in the hospital, but then agreed to settle the matter outside the court because she felt "fear of getting revenge" and worried that "would be humiliated in public."
This 34-year-old woman says now she's trying to cancel the peace settlement because she's still having a trauma to the incident that's due.
Ronaldo almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the attack, and this summer he moved to the giant Italia Juve club with a €100 million deal.
Brexit: English 'will regret forever' on the loss of car manufacturers
English "will regret forever" if it loses its status as world leader as a car manufacturer after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added to Toyota, England has told the BBC that if England comes out of the European Union without an agreement, for a while it will stop production at its factory in Burnston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said that if there was no agreement, Brexit would be losing in the job cost.
The factory in Burnston - which made Auris and Avensis production Toyota - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year that 90% were exported to the whole European Union.
"I think it's if England comes out of the European Union at the end of March, we'll see the production stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's executive director at Burnston.
The other British car manufacturers have expressed their concern about its exit from the European Union without any agreement on how the border trade would run, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said to close the mini factory in Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem related to what the car manufacturers said is the risk of a market chain if there is no agreement with Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on the basis of the "precisely time" production principle, with a layer that enters every 37 minutes from the British and the European Union for cars made according to the load.
If England leaves the European Union without an agreement on March 29th, there may be a disturbance in the border, which, according to industry, could lead to a break-in and a lack of the burden.
It will not be possible for Toyota to keep more than one day's supplies at his factory in Derbyshire, the word of company administration, and thus production will be stopped.
Clark said the Chequers Theresa May plan to connect with the European Union at the time was "calibrated properly to avoid border checks."
"We need to have a deal, we want to get the best deal that will also allow what I say not only to enjoy success at this moment, but for us to get this opportunity," he told the BBC Radio Today program 4.
"It's not just from Toyota, but also from other producers, that we really need to be able to continue what's already been a very good supply chain."
Toyota couldn't say how long his production would be stopped, but clearly in the long run, warned that the cost supply would reduce the competitive power of the factory and ultimately lose in the cost of the job.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the director of the United Workers' Association at the factory, says the members are becoming increasingly concerned: "Because of my experience, so far away, this work will never return.
The jury says, "We have put in place an accurate and reasonable plan for our relationship with the European Union at the coming time."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be back in the dark, the atmosphere of the White House
The high-risk meeting of Donald Trump with the high-level attorney Rod Rosenstein can be "re-cast" once a week because the battle against the chief court of Brett Kavanaugh still continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the special advisory work of Robert Mueller, who is investigating the involvement of Russia in public elections, the relationship between Trump and Russia's assistants, and the potential to hinder justice by the president.
Whether Trump would fire a high-level attorney or not, which would endanger Mueller's freedom, has sparked rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing using telegrams to record talks with Trump and the possibility of excommunicating the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein objected to that report.
But the other day he went to the White House, in the middle of a report that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he'd "choose not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was called back to avoid interference with the Senate justice committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI's investigation for a week at the top of the claim against Kavanaugh, which later delayed the hearing of the Senate.
Press Secretary Trump, Sarah Sanders, appeared at Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "Depends on the meeting that's not settled, it could be this week, I can see that it's going back to the next good week also remember the other things that happened in the grand court.
But let's just see, and I always want to deliver the latest news to the press."
Some journalists will oppose the statement: Sanders has not held a press meeting in the White House since September 10th.
The director of Chris Wallace's show asked why.
Sanders said it's not uncommon to meet because they don't like TV reporters "who are trying to attract attention," though, he said, "I don't really agree that they're trying to attract attention."
Then he suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press be strengthened.
"The president did more questions directly than the previous president," he added without mentioning the evidence: "We have seen these numbers."
The meeting will still happen, says Sanders, but "if the press has a chance to ask questions to the President of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do it more often and you've seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and it'll replace the press conference if you can talk to the president of the United States."
The trumpet routine asked questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with high officials.
The solo press conference rarely happened.
This week in New York, the president may be showing his reasons, making his appearance free and sometimes weird before the press gathers.
Health Secretary wrote to European Union workers in NHS Scotland about concerns about Brexit
Health Secretary has written to the staff of the European Union working in the NHS Scotland to express their gratitude to the country and hope that they will continue to work here after the Brexit problem.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months to England to withdraw from the European Union.
The government of Scotland has made a commitment to meet the cost of permanent status assistance for citizens of the European Union who work in the services transferred.
In his letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between England and the European Union on this flight continue, approaching the decision expected in this fall.
However, the British government has also prepared for the possibility of a scenario without an agreement.
I know this must be very disturbing for you all.
That is why I now want to stress again how much I appreciate the contributions of each member of the staff, left behind from their homeland.
Fellows from all over the European Union, and others, have gained valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance health services, and benefit the patients and society we serve.
Scotland really is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie Launches Emergency Operations After Coping With Headache
Tennesssee State Tigers background, Christian Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after having had a head injury at 31-27 of Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Coach Head of Tennessee State, Rod Reed told the injured reporter that it happened shortly before the baby was finished.
"He came to the back of the field and fell down there," said Reed.
Training and medical power gave oxygen to Abercrombie in the back of the field before putting it in the den and taking it to further evaluate it.
An officer from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris adds that "there is no detail about the type/level of injury that is experienced" and the State of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurs.
Abercrombie, the two-year-old student, was in his first spring with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He got a total of five bikes on Saturday before he got out of the game, which made his total bike this summer 18 bikes.
A foreign buyer will be charged higher material costs if he buys property in England
Foreign buyers will be charged higher material costs when they buy property in England, as well as additional money to be used to help the uninnovators according to the new Tory plan
This step will hold back the progress of Corbyn's movement in attracting young voters
The cost of these materials will be paid to those who do not pay taxes in England.
The Finance Department estimates that it will collect up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreigners will be wearing a higher mammoth when they buy property in England - along with the additional money that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce it today.
This step will be seen as an effort to hold back the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts in attracting young electorate by promising to provide a more modest and profitable enterprise.
The cost of materials will be borne to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in England, along with additional money that stimulates the government’s efforts to combat fraud.
The additional costs are additional to the current material cost, including the higher level identified two years ago at a second - and - a - half - house purchase to reach three percent.
The Finance Department expects this move to go up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built property in London was purchased by non-English residents, causing price increases and making it more difficult for the first buyer to raise his feet in the yard.
A lot of rich areas in this country -- usually in the capital -- have become "the ghost city" because a lot of foreign buyers spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy came out just a week after Boris Johnson called on the cashier to help more young people have their first home.
He accused a large construction company of maintaining a high price of property by buying land but not using it, and pressured Ms. May to ignore the quota for the homes in order to repair the "supply" in England.
Corbyn has announced a series of exciting corporate reform issues, including renting and ending the call "without guilt".
He also wanted to give the council greater power to build new homes.
Mrs. May said, "I promised last year that I would dedicate myself to the prime minister's office to restore the British dream that life should be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our broken corporate market.
English will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, it is not the right thing for individuals who do not live in England, as well as a foreign - based company, to buy a house that is easy to use in Britain.
For many people's dreams of having a home become something very far away, and the conduct of the ignorant towards the still real.
Jack Ross: 'My main ambition is to lead the Scotland team'
Boss Sunderland, Jack Ross says "main ambition" is to be Scotland's manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scottish player, enjoying the challenge of revitalizing the North-East Club, which currently holds the third level in the 1st League, a range of three points from the top position.
He moved to the Stage of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Prime Minister's League last summer.
"I want to buy my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that's him," Ross told Sportsound, BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up and often watched the Scottish team at Hampden with my father as a child, and it always became something that drew me back.
But the chance will come, if I succeed in team management."
Sunderland manager before Ross, among others Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
This former boss Alloa Athletic said he didn't feel eager to follow the big names in that whole club, after before refusing to offer from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"To me, the success of this moment will be measured by 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because the structure and facilities in this club are no longer suspected of being in the Premier League," he said.
"Don't make it easy to be there, but I might just see myself as a successful person here, if I could bring this club back there."
Ross' career in team management was only three years, after some time as a boss assistant in Dumbarton, and spent 15 months as a training staff in Hearts.
And then he helped Alloa recover from the degradation to the third position, and turn St. Mirren from the degradation shield into the winner of the next season's championship.
And Ross says now he feels more comfortable than he ever did during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"This may be the passage I have to go through," he recalls when he took over Alloa.
"I'm really sure management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds really weird because I'm okay, looking for a decent way to make a living, and enjoying some things that's right.
But playing can be hard.
Many things you have to spend every week.
I'm still experiencing it in the matter of working pressure, but in managing it feels good.
I always want to lead something and now I do it, the most comfortable thing I've ever felt for the rest of my life."

Survey found, the right time to drink beer is 17.30 a.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has increased public income in England fighting to survive, but more pressure on the restaurant network.
The figures show that the audience and the bar saw sales of 2.7 percent in July — but incomes of 4.8 percent in the restaurant fell.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant, who prepares these figures, says: "The rising sun and the British participation in the World Cup longer than expected, July will follow the same pattern as the previous June, where public income increases by 2.8 percent, except for a restaurant that gets severe support.
The trade in restaurants down to 1.8 percent in June will get worse in July.
Public and bar sales selling drinks so far are the strongest appearance compared to what happened at the restaurant down.
The public who sell food also suffers from the heat of the sun, although it does not separate the restaurant operator.
Looks like people just out for a drink.
Sales all over the pub and the bar that sells drinks up to 6.6 percent for this month, selling three percent down."
Paul Newman, a recreation analyst and RSM hotel, says, "This has been on the train we've seen since April.
The weather and impact of social events or sports remain the biggest factor in the sale of markets outside the home.
No wonder that the group of restaurants continues to fight to survive, even though the total sales of 4.8 percent a year will be very painful over the current cost pressure.
The long hot season should not come at the time of the food sales operator having bad times, and the time will tell you whether the good enough temperature we enjoyed in August will give you a little rest you need."
The total sales growth in all the pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, showing the bridge on the launch of the brand.
The supply of the Coffer Peach Tracker industry for the pub, bar, and restaurants in England collects and analyzes film data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than £9 billion, and is an industry-size gap that can no longer be reached.
One of five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
Survey reveals, one of the five children - some of whom are 11 years old - have a secret social media account they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the development of the fake Insta page.
This report has raised concerns about posting sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" account to show their parents
One of five children is still 11 years old — making social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a fake Insta account growth -- a reference to a photo-sharing website in Instagram.
The news has raised the anxiety of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say they operate a "main" account that's been cleaned to show the parents, while they also have a personal account.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret site, found a teenager who asked others to "strengthen me."
Research conducted by the English Digital Association and the Conference of the Head of the School of Men and the Head of the School of Women (HMC) from independent schools found 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, with half of them admitting to keeping a personal account.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said, "This disturbs so many young children that they try to create an online space that their parents and teachers cannot find."
Elid Doyle will be "a voice for athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Chamber.
Elid Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Chamber as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is an athlete in the ski and the most respected of Scotland's fields and the leader of Ian Beattie described this movement as a great opportunity for those leading the sports field to benefit from his many experiences at international level for the past few decades.
"Eilid is highly respected throughout Scotland, England, and the world's athletic community and we're sure athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing him into the hall," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I act as a voice for athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help lead sports in Scotland."
American athletes, who won the 200-metre race and 400-metre race at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta between the total four gold medals of the Olympics and now become this BBC expert, are now unable to walk after a momentary ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "This month I suffered a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctor says only the time that can determine if I can recover and to the extent that it recovers.
It is a very difficult job to recover completely, to learn again how to walk, and to do today’s sports training!
Thank you for sending me strong messages."
A breast pump advertisement that compares mother to cow has split opinions in the online world
The breast pump company has shared views in the online world with an advertisement that compares mother to a cow being washed.
To mark the launch of a product called "a breast pump that can be used with the first silence in the world," the consumer technology company Elvie launched an ad inspired by sexual music video to show the freedom that this new pump was given to express a mother.
Four moms danced in a cave full of straw and followed a song that reflected the lyrics like this: "Yes, I'm shaking myself, but you don't see the tail" and "If you don't notice this isn't black, it's my breast."
It goes on with the refrain, "The pump goes out, the pump goes out, I feed them love, the pump goes out, the pump goes out, I wash my woman's milk."
However, advertisements published on this company’s Facebook page have led to online controversy.
With 77,000 times seen and hundreds of comments, this video has received a mixed response from the mirror, with many who say it makes a "power" in the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision to use a cow to advertise this product.
Just like us, the cow must also be pregnant and give birth to produce milk, unless the baby is stolen from them within a few days after giving birth," said someone.
Elvie's breast pump is very common in BH following (Elvie/Mbu)
Another comment: "A trauma that can be understood well for mothers and babies.
But why don't you use it to announce a breast pump to the mother who has to keep her baby?"
Others add, "A lost advertisement."
The other guy's defending the advertisement, with a woman admitting that he found that song "lucky."
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'll buy it if I still get it.
Meeras made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but I got it.
It's a brilliant product," somebody wrote.
And some of them say, “This is a good news for the pregnant mothers, and they feel like dogs.”
It's not an advertisement that commends or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all felt dancing with hidden pumps inside their arms.
The basic concept of this campaign comes from the custody of many women who are striving for ASI who say they feel like a cow.
However, the Elvie Pump is really crazy, without cable or pipe and passage in the bra followed, which gives women freedom to move, hug their babies, and even go out and crawl.
Ana Balarin, a teammate and ECD at Mother, commented: "The Elvie pump is a product that is worthy of being launched with conviction and provocative.
By comparing the image between expressing women and cows our desire to pump the ASI and all its challenges, and showing it through how to comfort and enjoy the full freedom offered by the new pumps.
It's not the first time Elvie's pump was the main news.
On the London Fashion Week, a mother with two young children was on the stage for designer Marta Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Move Quietly to the Tent Camp in the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained is increasing, although the monthly border crossings remain unaltered, most of the consequences of the harsh statements and policies introduced by Trump's government, which make it difficult to support children with sponsors.
Basically, most of the sponsors themselves are non-documented immigrants, and they are afraid of endangering their own ability to stay in that country by making progress to save children.
The risk increased in June, when the federal government announced that the sponsors and other adult members of the house had to hand over their fingerprints, and their data would be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer in the field of Immigration and Bea Cukai, witnessed in front of the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied for child support under the age of the desert.
The branch then made sure that 70 percent of those arrested did not have a history of crime.
"Almost 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or members of the sponsor's group are illegal in this country, and most of them are evil foreigners.
That's why we keep hunting those people," said Mr. Albence.
In order to process the children faster, the officers introduced new rules that required some of them to attend the court within a period of one month after being detained, not after 60 days, which became a previous standard, said the shelter worker.
Most of them appear through video conference calls, not directly, to request their legal status case to the immigration judge.
Those who were considered unworthy of receiving help would be deported.
The longer children are detained, the greater their anxiety or pressure, the greater their risk of increasing their violence or trying to escape, the more they have been subjected to surveillance and reports of the systems that have been accepted in the last few months.
The lawyers said that the anxiety increased in larger facilities such as Tornillo, which signs that a child struggling tends to be ignored, because of its size.
They said that moving children to a camp city without giving them enough time to get them emotionally or saying good-bye to their friends can spread the traumas that have been fought.
Syria asked the 'sitting forces' of the United States, France and Turkey to retreat immediately.
Being part of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Wild al-Moualem also asked the Syrian refugees to return, although the country's war has now entered the eighth year.
Moualem, who also served as prime minister's representative, said that foreign troops were illegally occupying Syria's land, for reasons of combating terrorism, and "will be dealt with in full."
"They must withdraw quickly and without imposing any conditions," he said to the nobleman.
Moualem stressed that "war on terror almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with more than a million refugees from their homes.
He stressed that Damascus would continue to "remove this holy war until we clear all Syrian territories" from the terrorist group and "the presence of an illegal foreign army."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, especially training and influencing the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war zone.
With regard to the refugee problem, Moualem insisted that they return immediately, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "extraordinary fears" that prompted refugees to move further away.
"We've asked the international community and the human organization to facilitate this future," he said.
"They're policing what's supposed to be a whole humanity problem."
The European Union and the United States warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war was agreed.
The U.S. diplomats said the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the great Idlib rebel castle has given the last opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a major attack from the Syrian troops supported by Russia in that province, where there are three million people.
But Moualem stressed that the treaty had a "clear date" and gave rise to the hope that military action would target the scholars including fighters from the Nusra Front related to Al-Qaeda, who "will be defeated."
The US envoy Staffan de Mistura hoped to speed up the first meeting of the new committee of government and opposition members to make the War Law for Syria and open the way to a public election.
Moualem laid down the requirements of the Syrian government's next meeting in the committee, stressing that the panel work should be limited to "to check the latest legal clauses," and warning against the mixing of hands.
Why Trump Will Win Second Period
According to that logic, Trump will win the general election again in 2020 except for the many liberal viewers who hope, the prosecution and scandal will end his presidency today.
No one doubt, "The end of the most dramatic presidency ever existed!"
So far, there are no signs of fatigue for the viewers.
Since 2014, the CNN's main service hour rate has increased more than twice as high as 1.05 million and the MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million master watch, an increase of 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has sat on top of cable TV levels with 3.5 million viewers on the night of the main news.
"This is a spirit that makes people interested in being something that is not yet understood," says Neal Baer, director of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor," about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And Some Hard Truths Going Into Hollywood Boys," has another theory.
He remembered taxis in Boston before the 2016 general election.
The driver said he'd give his voice to Trump.
Why?
"She said, 'Because she made me laugh," Miss Scovell said to me.
There is the value of entertainment in a troublesome situation.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, the stories that come from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether the immigrant family can reunite and restore the global economy.
In turn, a privilege that can only be felt by the most special viewer.
By the way, not just being a citizen of a country known when you found yourself watching the panel of experts debate the use of "backdrop" sources Bob Woodward for his book called "Fair," wearing a bird skin jacket for Paul Manafort's $15,000 worth of clothes with pride," Uphah The Washington Post and the implications of the terrible description of Storm Daniels about Trump's anatomy.
This time, I'll never see Super Mario again.
"The part of the politics that he does makes it the same as a real event that comforts you every night," says Brent Montgomery, executive head of Wheelhouse Entertainment and created "Pawn Stars," about the show scene player and Trump's daily story (choose enemy with NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).

A lot of money from outside won the choice contests of the most time-consuming time in White House
It is only true that Pennsylvania 17 received a flood of money, the blessings of repatriating the convention districts that provided two survivors in the same session.
The Pittsburg district was recently re-established, calling Conor Lamb from Rep. The Democrats - who won the seats in the other districts through a special summer election last year.
The progress against another survivor, the Republic of Keith Rothfus, is now representing the 12 - year - old Pennsylvania district, which has suffered from a new 17th Pennsylvania district.
These maps were re set after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that the old districts were unconstitutionally on the side of the Republic party.
Competition in the new Pennsylvania 17 district has resulted in a huge campaign of financial support between the large party, the Democratic Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a brief victory in the Maret special election that was held in general for the 18th Pennsylvania Convention District.
The seat has been held by the Republican Bureau for over a decade, and President Donald Trump wins the district with 20 points.
Politicians sent the Democratic Party a little higher.
A.S. Balanced the punishment of El Salvador for supporting the barber, and then retreated.
Diplomats make sure that the Dominican Republic and Panama have acknowledged Beijing, giving little pressure from Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and ordered hotels in Panama until the team expelled the Trump Management Team.
The Department of Foreign Affairs decided to withdraw the head of the American diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on "the latest decision that no longer recognizes Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a departmental juror, posted in a statement earlier this month.
However, punishment was considered only for El Salvador, who received assistance of some $140 million from the United States in 2017, including for drug control, development support, and economics.
Sentences, including financial support and targeted visa restrictions, will harm the Central American country and rise to the level of unemployment and murder.
When internal meetings took place, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to attend the same year that was considered a step forward to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior government officials insisted that they want a conference to be continued, so that an effective end to the trial for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to give a speech at that conference, this time scheduled for mid-October, as an import signal by the government in that neighborhood, the diplomats' representatives.
And the third American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing new counsel or severe punishment from Washington.
A White House jury for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate presented by the third U.S. office, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal consideration of this unclear situation.
Their statements were reinforced by external analysts close to government and also spoke about these indistinct conditions.
Study Edition
The other surprising story is a special advisor's report by Robert Mueller on the possibility of Mr. Trump's extradition, which is now a very important evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller's report also discussed his investigation into whether Trump's campaign was collaborating with Russia in an attack on our public elections.
When Congress moves hands, Mr. Trump will be called upon to assume responsibility for himself, as soon as he prepares to go back to the electorate, and may eventually become a jury of his fellow believers.
Therefore, there is still much to be done, and I do not mean to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump's reign cannot be avoided or reduced in Europe.
There's a better choice we'd make on both sides of the Atlantic that'd affect how long we'd been fighting.
In 1938, German officials were ready to fight Hitler, had the West opposed him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We've failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the years that followed.
The beginnings of history have been centered on the point of such a change, and the speed of democracy or postponing of it cannot be avoided.
Today, the United States faces a number of such changes.
What should we do if Trump fired General Rod Rosenstein, the one who watched the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since then reports that, last year, he suggested that he secretly record the president and think that he was not worthy of the president.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times account was wrong.
"How do we respond if the F.B.I. investigation that has just been requested by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he has been appealed to the Supreme Court even if there is a strong charge of sexual assault and unfair testimony?
And besides, are we going to give a half-time voice to Congress that will demand Trump's responsibility?
If we fail to pass that test, democracy will continue to deteriorate in the long run.
But I believe we will succeed, because the lessons I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my great position.
He survived, then immigrated to America and, 60 years later, asked me to light the candles on the table that wrote the toilet.
By leaving that legacy to me, how can I lose hope about our future?"

Rangers 'Graham Dorrans feel optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are visiting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, fighting Austria, following a good deal of money in Spain against Villareal this early month, will strengthen their position to get away from the Group of the G League of Europeans.
The knee wound made the middle of Graham Dorrans can't be seen in this first season until the result of 2-2 against Villareal, but he's sure Rangers can take advantage of it as a stone to greater hope.
"This point is very good for us because Villareal is a great team," said the 31-year-old player.
"In this game we're sure we can get something and go with one point at a time.
Finally, we may be able to do so, but we believe that the results may be fair.
In the first chapter, they may look better, but in the second chapter, we get up and become a better team.
On Friday, tonight is another great European day.
We hope to climb the three points even though they will be a difficult match because they have good results in their last match, but, with support behind us, I'm sure we can keep moving forward and get positive results.
In the past year, we had a hard time, because my injuries and changes in the club itself have occurred, but now there is a very good hope in this club.
It's a good shot and the kids really enjoy it. It's a good training.

Although it turns out that surveyors have a dirty idea of how they want to be treated, there are not many people who have talked to their family about it.
Probably half of the people in the nationwide study discussed long-term care costs with their mates.
Just 10 percent of them say they're talking about this with their kids.
"They want family members to provide care, but there's no way to start the trial," said Holly Snyder, president of the National Life Insurance Business.
Here's the time to start.
Start talking to your spouse and children: you won't be able to prepare your own family to care if you don't tell your wishes first.
Speak with your family’s advisers, where and how you get treatment, because the choice you make will mean a lot to determine the cost.
Give your financial advice: Your advisers can certainly help you by showing you how to pay those fees.
The services you choose for long-term care include traditional long-term care insurance policy, hybrid cash insurance policy that guarantees these costs or ensures yourself with your wealth-- as long as you have money.
Show your legal documents: In case of a pending legal dispute.
Immediately show the power for your health care, that is someone you trust to ensure your health care and ensure that your wishes are carried out by professionals when you cannot communicate.
On the other hand, the letter of power in the matter of financial matters should also be considered.
Someone who trusts to manage all your financial decisions you have to choose, except to make sure your bill is paid if you can't.

A man was shot by a windgun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot with a wind gun on his way home from a party night.
Those 40-year-old victims were in the Oxford Grove area, Ilfracombe, Devon, when several shootings were about their breasts, their stomachs, and their hands.
The shooting was described by the officer as happening around 02:30 BST, and it was said to be "an accident."
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
The injuries suffered by the victim are not a threat to his soul and a number of witnesses have been reported by the police.
Earthquakes and tsunamis surrounding Indonesia
Earthquakes and tsunamis were so intense that the city of Palu, Indonesia, on Friday, had destroyed a few 384 souls, the number of officers, and the number of victims was expected to increase.
It was decided that the communication would make officers who provided trouble relief to get information from the Doggala Republic, a region north of the Palu city that is closer to the centre of the earthquake that hit with the power of 7.5 Richter scale.
In Palu, after the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Below are a number of major facts about the cities of Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located on the narrow edge of the west coast of the Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, this city is celebrating its 40th birthday.
In the meantime, Dotaka was an extensive population of over 300 km (180 miles) from the shoreline on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi.
This province, which is the administrative region under the province, is estimated to have 299,200 souls in 2017.
The economic eyes of Andlan in the South Sulawesi province are searching for fish and matching crops, especially on the coasts of Dongala.
However, the presence of nickel - building is also important in this province, although most are located in Morowali, on the other side of the Sulawesi coast.
Listed in the last 100 years, Palu and Dondalla have been sent several times to tsunamis, based on data from the Indonesian Disaster Management Board.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in tsunamis and hundreds of homes in Dongala.
In 1996, nine people died in a tsunami in western Dongal.
In a seismic way, Indonesia is located on the Pacific Fire Cincinn and therefore the earthquake will happen in an orderly manner.
A number of shocks and big tsunamis that have been going on for the last few years are as follows:
In 2004: December 26, Indonesia was hit by a massive earthquake, right on the west coast of the province of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, which also triggered tsunami in 14 countries, to eliminate 226,000 lives along the coast of the Indian Ocean, and more than half of the victims died in Aceh.
2005: At the end of March and early April, a violent storm struck the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the Sumatran coast.
2006: An earthquake of 6,8 southeastern Java, the worst island in Indonesia, triggered tsunamis on the southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: The city’s capital, West Sumatra, was hit by an earthquake of 7.6 in the vicinity of Padang.
The victims are more than 1,100 people.
2010: One island on the island of Manatwai, in the south of Sumatra, was also hit by an earthquake of 7.5, causing it to reach a peak of 20 feet (10 m) a minute and to kill about 300 people.
2016: Pidi Jaya, Aceh, native of the Republic, also experienced shock and destruction, as well as the panic of people who remembered the devastating effects of earthquake and tsunamis that killed in 2004.
Although this time there is no tsunami, more than 100 people have died because of the collapse of the building.
2018: Lombok, which is considered a tourist island, has also suffered a massive earthquake that kills more than 500 people, most of whom are on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake forced thousands of buildings to be destroyed, and thousands of tourists were thrown into it.
Suulul son of Sarah Palin was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and candidate for president, has been captured with a plot of attack.
Palin, 29 years old, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence, obstructed domestic violence, and opposed attempts to arrest, such as a report by the Alaskan National Police on Saturday.
According to a police report, when a woman's acquaintance was trying to call the police to report a suspected crime, she picked up the phone from the woman.
Palin was handed over to the Mat-Su Prapedradilan Prison, with $500 in security, as reported by the KTUU.
As reported by the news network, Palin attended the trial on Saturday, stating himself "innocent, confident" when asked about his defence.
Palin faced three minor Class A violations, which could put him in prison for a year and a fine of $250,000.
In addition, he was also charged with the claim of Class B, with the punishment of one day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
For Palin, this is not the first time.
In December 2017, he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the attack.
The case is now referred to the Alaskan Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of seeking domestic violence, of preventing reports of domestic violence, and of holding firearms in a drunken state, which is also related to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of looking at his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was threatened by a group of veterans seeking to link her son’s violence with PTSD as a result of his work in Iraq.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of victims died
On Friday, the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia was struck by a terrible earthquake until at least 384 victims died.
A 7.5-scale earthquake that has the potential to trigger tsunamis has forced thousands of homes to be destroyed.
The electricity grid and communication connections are broken, and the number of deaths is projected to continue to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake was at that time beating the central Sulawesi, which lay east of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos that show how intense the moments of the disaster go through social media.
Hundreds of middle-aged people gathered to celebrate a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time, when the tsunami broke down the beach.
The federal prosecutor tried to force a death sentence that rarely occurred to suspect a terrorist attack at NYC.
The federal prosecutor in New York attempted death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City, where eight people were killed -- that sentence was rare and had never been done in the country of the federal crime most recently since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, was supposed to have been attacked by hitting a truck he was hired from Home Depot on foot and a bicycle driver on a bike along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October.
In order to allow this death penalty, the prosecutors must provide evidence that Saipov "in deliberate" killed the eight victims and "in deliberate" caused serious bodily injury, based on a statement of intent to lower the death penalty, which was referred to the South New York District.
On the basis of the court’s documents, the two charges allowed the death penalty to be dropped.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov's federal jury seized 22 charges, including eight charges of murder in an attempted murder, which were usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime, and charges of violence and attempted to damage the motor vehicle.
According to the prosecutor, the attack requires "substantial planning and early development," as a depiction of Saipov's crimes committed with "worse, cruel, and inadvertent."
As stated in the statement of intent, "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, danger, and loss of family and friends from Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five victims of the incident were visitors from Argentina.
Counted one decade since the South New York District dropped the death penalty last time.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, accused of murdering two drug addicts, was finally sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last execution of the death sentence at the New York federal court in 1953 was dropped in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were convicted of spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
The Rosenberg couple were executed with the power station on June 19, 1953.
On the basis of the court documents, Saipov, from Uzbekistan, did not show how sorry he had been for the day and month after the attack.
When questioned by the investigator, he said that he was happy with what he had done, the police.
Saipov also revealed to the authorities that the attack he was making was inspired by the video ISIS that was watched from his phone, like the content of the claim.
He also asked the ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, the police station.
He stated that he was innocent of 22 charges against him.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said "evidently disappointed" about the prosecutor's decision.
"In our view, the decision to execute death rather than receive a request for guilt for the life sentence without a guarantee of release will only extend the trauma of the people involved in the incident," Patton said.
Previously, Saipov's defence team had asked the prosecutor not to drop the death penalty.
NIGEL FARAGE is responsible for the Brexit negotiations, says Tory MP
Nigel Farage called for 'crowding the population' today in protest action at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the Ukip said that politicians should feel 'hot' Eurosceptics -- because one of the members of parliament, Theresa May, suggested that they join the EU negotiations.
Conservative group supporters, Peter Bone, told road action in Birmingham that England should 'be out' right now if Farage served as Secretary of Brexit.
However, the challenge faced by May in reconciling his shared position has been undermined by Remain Tories supporters who join in separate protest actions threatened Brexit in that city.
Prime Minister fought to defend the Chequers compromise plan to remain in its path even though in the middle of the Brexiters, Remainers and the European Union.
The partners stressed that he would be moved to reach agreement with Brussels, even though he had a bad back reaction -- and forced Eurosceptics and labour to decide the choice between its source package and the 'disquiet' package.
Bone told the Left Means Leave in Solihul that he wanted to remove the Chequers.
As a result, Farage has to point out to his colleagues to be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If the boss remains responsible for him, we'll be out now," he says.
Members of Parliament Wellingborough said, "I'm ready to stand up for Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers."
His point, he's still showing his opposition to the European Union: "We don't fight in the world's war to be subdued.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country.'
Bone notes that public opinion has been able to bring about changes since the 2016 sound release: "The idea that the English people's thinking has changed and wanted a regular condition is absolutely not true."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkins, also involved in that mass action, posted to the reporter: 'Simply, I want to say, Prime Minister, listen to your people.
"Chequers are not popular among the generals, but the opposition will not choose them, because they are not popular with the parties and our activists who really went down the road and made us selected in the first position.
Our request, remove the Chequers and start listening to us.'
And he said, “The Minister will preserve their matter when they have agreed.”
Farage said that political demonstrations had to be thwarted in order to "taste its heat" if they wanted to disobey the 2016 referendum decision.
"Now the most precious thing is the belief among us -- our people and our political people," he said.
And they said unto them, We will not let you go, because ye have rejected Brexit this day.
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: 'I want you to make our political people, who are preparing to disobey Brexit, also feel its heat.
"We are moving the soldiers of this country who will conquer us in Brexit and never give up until the British is in power, self-government and pride."
Meanwhile, the remnants moved through Birmingham before calling for action in the city center for two hours.
Activist lines appear to spread the Tories Against Brexit after launching the line at the end of this week.
Fellows in the line of work, Lord Adonis, mock the conservative group related to the security issues of their party's application when the conference was opened.
"These are the people who told us that they can control the IT system and all the technologies for Canada, whatever, for the sake of anti-freedom, free trade patterns in Ireland," he recovered.
"It's a show.
There's no good Brexit at all,' it's growing.
Warren planned to do 'serious break' in the president's lobby.
Senator Elizabeth Warren said he was going to "break up the president's strike" after the election date in November.
Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democratic Party announced its future at the city hall in Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who was threatened by President Donald Trump, urged his election back in November against the country's GOP prosecution, Geoff Diehl, the leader of the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
In national speculation, he was marked as a Trump opponent in 2020.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon at Holyoke was the 36th with the electorate, which was marked with city hall format since Trump served.
An actor asked him if there was any plan to promote himself as president.
Warren replied, "This is the right time for a woman to enter the Washington district to restore our corrupt government, and that includes the time for women to sit on the top."
He's been captured by Sims' shooter, LSU player.
On Saturday, Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced that he had been arrested by the suspect of shooting until the death of Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested at 11 a.m. in the ET press conference.
They got video clips on Friday, where an identified man asked for help as seen in the recording.
Friday morning, Sims, 20 years old, was shot and found dead near Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound in his head and eventually died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, through 247 sports.
Wayde was trying to protect his friend and Simpson fired a shot at him.
When questioned, Simpson admitted to being at the scene, holding firearms, and shooting him toward Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without a fight and imprisoned in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A junior player with six feet high, grew up in Baton Rouge, that's Sims, has played in 32 matches with 10 early last season and an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 points in each match.
Grand Prix Ajang in Russia: Lewis Hamilton won the world's title after the team acknowledged his victory over Sebastian Vettel
It all became clear when the Bottas Valteri was in front of Lewis Hamilton in a qualifying regiment on Saturday that would bring the Mercedes team's command to play a major role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start position and almost left Hamilton because he defended his position in the first two rounds and drew Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel became the first to go into the pit and let Hamilton move into the pit at the end of the crowd, something that should have been very determined.
Mercedes entered one sheet after and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton continued on after some action that showed the Ferrari driver's entry left the part empty with the risk of holding up after a double move to survive on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started starting at the back of the grid and was in the seventh position at the end of the first sheet on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race because he held the ban shift to plan a quick settlement and took over the Kimi Raikkonen position for the fourth position.
He finally got into the pit in the 44th, but he couldn't increase his pace in the eight remaining leaves because Raikkonen finally took fourth position.
It was a difficult day because Valteri did a fantastic job all weekend and a real man who let me.
Tim has done a great job to have one two," said Hamilton.
It's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein in a relic on Saturday through his village, he didn't throw a letter from Christine Blasey Ford about sexual abuse of the High Judge Brett Kavanaugh
Speaking in a newspaper in West Virginia, the president did not directly present a statement made by Ford before the Senate's Pradial Committee, but instead commented on what was going on in the Senate that showed people who were "slow and unscrupulous and dishonest."
"Something can happen and the beautiful thing is happening over the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people angry and evil and insanity and dishonesty," he said.
"When you saw the lightning and the lightning, then they said, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you fire her?
Remember the answer... did you burn the document-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't throw it away."
Okay, wait a minute.
Did we fire... no, we didn't fire it," plus, as a senator's impression.
Feinstein had sent a letter that pointed out the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and it had been fired earlier in September — but Feinstein objected that it did not come from his office.
"I'm not hiding Dr. Ford's accusation, I'm not throwing away his story," Feinstein's statement to the committee, said Hill.
"He asked me to hide it and I kept it as a secret as his request."
But the opposition seems to be unconfirmed by the president, who commented during a line on Saturday night: "I'll tell you, it's a very bad language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but it's the worst language I've ever seen."
Further his defense against the High Judge, who was accused of sexual harassment against three women, the president was impressed that the Democrats were using charges for their own sake.
"They are determined to take over power in various ways.
You see wickedness, harmony, they don't care who they're sick, who they have to walk to get power and surveillance," Mediaite reports on the president's speech.

The airflow driver then left to secure hundreds of passengers on a plane safe from the quake
A pilot passed an airship in Indonesia and was banished as a hero after his death when he made sure a plane that took hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
More than 800 people have died in the world and many others have disappeared after a major earthquake over the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering the tsunami.
A strong storm continues to strike the region and many trapped in the ruins of Palu city.
But according to his colleagues, the 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan the Great refused to leave his post at a driving tower that crashed hard in Sis Al Jufri Mutiara, Palu.
He chose to stand by to make sure that the 6321 Batik Air Flight was then on the runway, could safely take off.
He then jumped out of the driver's tower and crossed when he felt the tower began to fall.
He died after he was in the hospital.
The jury spoke to the Service Navigation Bureau of Indonesia, Johannes Sirat, about his decision to save hundreds of lives, reports from the ABC Australia news.
We made a helicopter from the Balichpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost our sail this morning before the helicopter reached the Palu.
"We're all sorry to hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities worried about the death of the victim could reach thousands after the National Disaster Relief Board had made it difficult for them to access the city of Dongala, Sigi, and Boutong.
"Sacrifice assured will continue to increase because of the many bodies of victims that are still in ruins and many others that cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a national body spoke of the disaster of Sutopo Nugroho.
The volume of the six-metre wave has led to a rising tide that caused mass funerals on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft brought relief supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance carries a body.
Clean water becomes rare.
Minimarkets everywhere in history"
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Arrow in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Arrow is working hard to help the survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's been a tragedy, but maybe it's getting worse."
Indonesia President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and asked Indonesian national soldiers: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Ready?" CNN report.
In the early years of this year, Indonesia was also sent by a earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Water Niugini reported a missing person after an aircraft crash
The air carrier operated a plane crashing into the Pacific basin in Micronesia and reported that one person had disappeared, after being previously reported to 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from a sinking aircraft.
Water Niugini presented a report on Saturday afternoon, the authorities were unable to identify a passenger.
The company said the company had cooperated with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the man.
The company did not respond quickly to the passengers ’ requests for more details, such as their age or nationality.
Local boats help rescue passengers along with other ships, after a plane hit the water when trying to land at Chuuk Island.
On Friday, the officials reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The company reported the remaining six passengers to the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the order of events still remain unclear.
The company and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed on the runway.
Some witnesses feel a plane crossing the runway.
U.S. citizen Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
"That's really good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others were able to cross the water at a height through the emergency door on that sinking plane.
He reported panic and screaming to the refugees, and he suffered a little headache.
The U.S. Navy says that fishermen who work close to the repaired dermaga also help rescue ships use carte to transport people to the ground before sinking in the interior about 30 meters (100 feet) in the water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicates 111 people have died in an accident of registration-PNG for the last two decades but none of them have involved Air Niugini.
Analysis releases a woman's life-burning nightline
The demand for detention of things that took place on Saturday in a man's re-examination that was charged with a life-burning fire against a Mississippi woman in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, witnessed for several hours as a witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He made a big line to the jury about how he used cell phone records to collect all the moves that were made at the age of 29 Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victims, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received location data from some cell phones that showed Tellis to be in one location with Chambers on the night of his death, compared to a statement previously accused, announced by Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that the cell phone was in one location with Chambers during that time, he argued that he was at the time with his friend Michael Sanford, the police finally asked for an explanation from Sanford.
Sanford followed the trial on Saturday and he testified that he was not in the city on the day of the incident.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck on the night of the incident, Sanford said he was "a liar, because my truck was in Nashville."
The other inconsistency reported by Tellis was his statement that he knew Chambers about two weeks until the death of the victim.
Cell phone records indicate that they were acquainted with each other within a period of one week.
Rowlett reported that after the death of Chambers, sometimes Tellis deleted messages, calls and contact with Chambers' information from his phone.
"He removed the victims from his life," Hale said.
The survey was scheduled to begin on Sunday’s closing remarks.
The judge announced that he hoped that the trial would be brought to the jury that day.
The High Breed: What is the spirit of hip hop?
A group of hip hops want to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, who comes from Bristol, claims that hip-hop movements are far from the origins of political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make the hip hop more popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons have seen recent resurrections in the UK through some artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Other black people?
NY guardian demands a couple because they attack after issuing a "racialist" message
A New Yorker demanded a couple because he had attacked in a discriminatory way after receiving an indirect message from a complain mother and said that he was "the other blacks."
The couple refused if they were considered racist, and they considered it more like "aggravation."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed concern when she realized that the new care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black after she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"There's no way we're going to get another one," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
Anyway, instead of sending it to her husband, she even sent it to Ms. Maurice twice.
After realizing his mistake, the "ungood" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, stating that they had left the foster home, which was an African-American blender, because he had done a bad job and he was expecting the Philippines, based on the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one day’s work and then used Uber.
Now, Maurice demands that the couple pay compensation for the placement, and asks for compensation of about $350 a day for a period of six months, as a substitute for the foster work that initially had to work, even though there was no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you can't do anything like that," he said to the post on Sunday, and he added, "I know it's a discrimination."
The couple opposed the claim that they said they were rational, that the worker who hired Maurice was a reasonable thing to do, that they were afraid they couldn't believe it after being offended,
"My wife has sent something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But can you let your children be treated by someone you've been rude to, even if it's just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
It's like being wrapped up in a "frequent," said Plasco's wife for two months gave birth to her baby and was in "a very difficult situation."
"You're going after someone like that?
It's not a good thing to do," the investment bank added.
When the legal case is still under way, the public opinion distribution has made a rapid threat to the couple in the social media, blaming them for their attitude and logic.
Paddington readers are worried that the reader will not be connected to the bear talking, the new newspaper is under arrest.
His daughter Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born not long after her book was accepted, explained in a letter: "It's hard to just talk without knowing the position in her mind, read it for the first time before it was published.
It's so funny to know how we know about the great success of Paddington."
Said his father, who was a BBC cameraman before inspired by the writing of a child's book with bear toys, who was very optimistic about the results of his work that had been rejected, he added the 60th anniversary of the publication that felt "sanctured" after his father's death last year.
For Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family," he added his father quite proudly with the end of his success.
"He's quite calm, and he's not proud," he said.
"But because Paddington means so much to him, it's like you have a son who's got something: you're proud of them though not all your efforts.
I think he looks at the success of Paddington like that.
Although it was the result of his creation and imagination, he always praised Paddington himself."
My daughter is in a state of death and I have to say goodbye to her through the phone.
At the time of his arrival, his daughter was quickly taken to Nice Louis Pasteur's hospital, but the doctors failed to save him.
"Nad called quietly to say it was very bad, that he was very likely not to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I got a call from Nad that said he'd die in a couple of minutes ahead and he asked me to say goodbye to him.
And I did it too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be right with you.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors have been given to keep her heart beating slowly and leave her body.
He died a few times during the process of handling and everything felt dead.
I could just sit there and wait, understand all this has been caught.
I can't scream or cry or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I really have to hold it all."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, at the moment of grief over the loss of her daughter, on board the plane with the other passengers - without realizing what she's been through.
"No one knows," he said.
"My head is drawn down and my eyes are still fixed all the time.
It's very difficult to explain, but when I was on the flight, I felt such a deep sympathy for Nad.
That he needs love and understanding from me.
I know how much she loves him."
Women who are mourning post cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones tried to prevent others from killing themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a bridge in Welsh with inspiring messages and numbers that can be contacted to get support.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, age 13 when he began to suffer depression and suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel like I feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, says that her son is a promising cook with a loud smile.
"Everyone knows him from his smile.
They always say that his smile reveals the atmosphere."
But, he stopped working before he died, like he was in a very dark place.
In 2014, Brother Tyler, then 11 years old, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm still worried if there's any side effects."
Mrs. Davis made those cards, "to tell people that there's someone out there that you can almost talk, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit down and shut up - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her husband for 15 years, not long after her mother died.
"He didn't say if he felt sad or depressed or anything," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed there was a change in his behavior.
He was in the coolest point of Christmas--when the kids opened their gifts he didn't look into their eyes or anything."
He said that his death was a great trauma to them, but they had to go through it, saying, "It makes a hole in the family.
That separates us.
But we have to go through it and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh was uncertain when the FBI started its investigation.
"I think, if we really get something like what he's asking -- an investigation that's limited in time, limited in time -- we might be able to bring a little unity," Mr. Flake's weather on Saturday, adding that he's afraid of the "destruction" committee in the midst of the division of the board.
Why doesn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
It's all because of time.
On November 6, when, as expected, the Republic did so badly, it would become very weak in its ability to make the people whom they wanted to choose to sit in the highest court.
George W. Bush has contacted the senators, beat them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him to meet his wife Ashley, who is Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI made the report?
There will be elections in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats will sit.
It's still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the president's representative, to determine the winner and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean producers 'anjlok' below Kim
The number of people from North Korea to South Korea has dropped dramatically since Kim Jong-un ruled seven years ago, under the auspices of a member of the United Korea parliament.
Byeong-seus Park, posting data from the southern integration government, said there were 1,127 rounds last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said border controls between North and South Korea and the higher tariffs supported by people's floodwaters are the key factors.
Pyongyang didn't give a public comment.
Most Northers were finally offered the South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fled through Tiongkok, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier across than the Demilitarization Zone between the two Koreas.
As a result, the fugitives were treated as illegal migrants and often forced to return them.
The relationship between the North and the South — still technically in war — has increased greatly in the last few months.
At the beginning of this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for a discussion focused on the negotiations of denuclearization.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un of Singapore, when they agreed in broad terms to work together on a nuclear-free trip to Korea.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blames US sanctions for the lack of development since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in that situation, we will not be able to drop our weapons on the one hand," Mr. Ri said in a speech in the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosio accused Brett Kavanaugh of "history," saying he did not fit to serve at the Supreme Court
The chief opposition party Nancy Pelosi accused the Supreme Court of being "histories" and said he did not fit in the temperament to serve at the Supreme Court.
Philosophy made that comment in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a Chinese woman like that, they'll say "history," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's witness in front of the judicial committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally protested that he had committed sexual harassment against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and sometimes almost screamed and had trouble speaking when discussing his family and his years in high school.
He also mistakenly condemned the Democrats in the committee, claiming that the "unreasonable and coordinated murder" was organised by the liberals who were angry because Hillary Clinton lost in the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's witness to prove that he could not serve at the Supreme Court because he was normal to the Democrats.
"I think he discredited himself with those statements and with his attitude towards Clinton and Democrats," he said.
Philosophy objected if he tried to claim that he was in agreement, and if the Democrats got more voices in the People's Court of Justice.
"I'll say this -- if he doesn't really tell Congress or the FBI, then he doesn't fit to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," said Pelosio.
Kavanaugh is now a judge at the D.C. High Court.
Philosophy added that as a Democrat he was concerned about the potential of Kavanaugh's decision on Health Services Or Roe V. Wade's Laws, because he was regarded as a conservative sense of justice.
In the committee of inquiry, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would distort certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for someone who's hysterical and usual to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that great?'
And the woman has to handle it.
It's ethical dissipation, anger for months and years, and he can't get it out without crying.
"We cried when we were angry: Miss Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"That's not strange to me, what do you think?"
He continued, "I'm really helped by a woman who's executive somewhere, who says she's also crying when she's angry, but developing a technique that means that she's angry and starts to cry, she's going to say to someone who's talking to her, "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then he goes on.
And I think it's brilliant."
The water was poured out as a way out of some anger because he was basically misunderstood.
One of my most powerful memories of the early work, in the office dominated by a man, at a time when I cried with unexpressed anger, was my stomach burned by a woman who was older - a cold manager who was always a little scared - who dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think they're successful."
Patricia Schroeder, a member of the Colorado Congress, once worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested in an out-of-marry affair on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Ms. Schroeder, was very frustrated, realizing that there was no reason for himself not to resign as president.
"It's not a mature decision," she said to me as she laughed 30 years later.
"There are seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Someone called it "The Snow Princess and the Seven Horses."
Because he's late in the campaign, he's left behind in a fundraiser, and so he swears he won't follow the election unless he's able to collect $2 million.
It was a battle that ended in defeat.
He found that some of his supporters gave the man $1,000 just gave him $250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" he asked.
When he went on to announce that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was overpowered by emotions - thank you to the people who supported him, frustration with a system that made the withdrawal of funds so difficult and to draw the electorate from the delegation, and anger against sexism - making him difficult to talk about.
"You may think that I'm too nervous," recalls Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacts to him.
"You'll think that Kleinex is my sponsorship.
I remember, I thought, what would they write in my sketch?

How the U.S. trade competition might be good for Beijing
The opening of the US-Tiongkok trade competition is so dissipated, and when the fight is still far from a word of effort, the gap between the two countries may only benefit Beijing in the long run, according to the experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, launched the first warning this early year by taxing Tionkok's key export goods including solar panel, steel and aluminium.
A very significant adjustment started this week with a new tariff that affected the value of $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods entering the United States through Tingkok.
Beijing has paid back every time, recently charged to five to ten percent of American goods worth $60 billion.
Bitch has requested to match the United States alone, and the second largest economy in the world will not change in the near future.
Ordering Washington to back off means following his wishes, but publicly defeating the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President Tiongkok.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards correctly, U.S. trade pressure can support Tingkok in a positive way in the long term by reducing inter-economic interdependence.
"The fact that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing can make economic movement in both countries even more dangerous than previously noted," said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focused on Asia in the Center for New American Security, a member.
Syria 'prepared' for the time of refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria said that they were ready for a voluntary flight and offered to help rebuild a country that had been destroyed by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the U.S. General Mayor, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in his country were improved.
"Today's situation in the field is more stable and secure, the blessings of progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the area that the terrorists have been destroyed to return it back.
All conditions are now present because refugees return voluntarily to the country they have to leave because of terrorism and the economic decisions that make their lives day by day and night as a target.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian citizens have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
Six million others who still live in that country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would receive help to rebuild a destroyed country.
But he stressed that they would not receive help or conditional assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.

It's a tough year.
Thank you very much to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so glad, I'm so glad to get the ball back.
It's about a team, and I'm glad I can help," Garcia said emotionally after winning Europe.
He gave his responsibility to his teammate John Ram who won the legendary US Tiger Woods 2&1 golfer in a single game in the week.
"Wonderful pride that I think, defeat Tiger Woods, I grew to see him," 23-year-old Rahm says.
Woods lost in his fourth match in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career records of Piala Ryder.

There's a time this morning when we're making Europe difficult.
We're fighting.
Honor Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players play very well.
We'll redesign, I'll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Piala Committee and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 people and I'm proud to be captain.
You have to give the honor.
We're losing pride."
