Members of the Assembly in Wales were afraid to "pass through Marretas"
There is a consensus by some Members of the Assembly of Wales (AM) on the suggestion that their title be changed to MWP (Galês Parliament Members).
The origin of this controversy is in the plans to change the name of the assembly for "Galês Parliament".
Some members of this House, from all the political colors, were afraid that this would make them laugh.
One AM worker said the group is concerned about the fact that "the designation rhyme with Twp and Pwp".
For non-galese readers: in the Welsh language, "twp" means "idiot" and "pwp" means "excrements".
A Plaid AM said that the group in its globality "was not satisfied" and suggested alternatives.
A French Conservative said that the group was "open-minded" about the change of name, but said that the MWP designation was literally very close to Muppet (Marreta).
In this context, the letter w in Welsh has a statement similar to that of the letter or in the English of Yorkshire.
The Committee of the Assembly, currently drafting legislation to introduce amendments to the name, stated: "The final decision on how Members of the Assembly are appointed will obviously be taken by themselves".
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave its assembly the power to change names.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with general support for the proposal to appoint the assembly by the Galês Parliament.
On the issue of the title of the AMs, the Commission favoured "Galês Parliament Members", or WMP, but the MWP option was more favourable in public consultation.
The AMs are apparently suggesting alternatives, but the effort to bring together consensus can be a headache for President Elin Jones, who should present a draft legislation on the amendments within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other amendments to the way in which the assembly is carrying out its activities, such as rules on the disqualification of AMs and the configuration of the commission system.
When the legislation is discussed, the AMs will have the final word on the question of how to be designated.
Macedonians will refer to the change of country name
The voters will vote on Sunday on the change of the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a conflict of decades with the neighboring Greece, which integrates a province with the name of Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting that the name of its neighbour in the north constitutes a claim on its territory, having repeatedly objected to its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, the rapporteur's supporters, among them Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the amendment of the name is no more than the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
Sons of St. Martin calm down at a time when the churches of Harlem struggle for survival
"No historical perspective, the elders I spoke to told me that there was a bar and a church on each corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's no one."
The disappearance of the bars, he said, understood.
"People socialize differently," he said today.
"The bars have stopped being the living rooms of the neighborhood where people go regularly."
As for the churches, he is concerned about the chance of winning money with the sale of heritage not to last as long as the leaders expect" and that sooner or later, everything will return exactly to the point of departure."
The churches, added, can be replaced by apartments with condominiums inhabited by people who will not support the sanctuaries of the neighborhood that still remain.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and so will the arrival of the day when these churches will all close, for it is unlikely that most of those who change for these complexes will join these congregations."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left here in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was then laid by a black congregation that carried out its worship in the immediate vicinity.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to the 125th Street lodgers, an important commercial street in Harlem that resisted the recruitment and promotion of black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged. However, when they made plans for their reconstruction, Father Johnson's parishioners ordered the carriage.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the carriage "the sons of the poor".
The specialist who touched the carriage in July called it another thing: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
This specialist, Tiffany Ng, at the University of Michigan, also mentioned that it was the first carriage of the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to the largest carriage in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather claimed St. Martin's didn't replace it.
What happened in St. Martin's in recent months was a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that this "procures to pass the costs", was bad that it had not been involved in the contract of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Tubarão causes injuries in 13-year-olds in a lobster hunting dive in California
A tuber attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a lobster hunting dive in California on the first day of the lagoon season, the authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly after the 7th of the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour how much he heard the boy screaming for help, and then ended up in his direction with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he initially thought it was just an enthusiasm for having caught a lobster, but that he later realized that the boy was shouting "I was bitten"!
I was bitten!
The entire key zone was dilated, Hammel described what he observed when he arrived at the boy.
"I cried out to everyone to get out of the water: "There is a pipe in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by air to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical state.
The species of the tube responsible for the attack is unknown.
The life-saving Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a pipeline had been detected in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma at the top of the trunk.
The authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Giles reported that there are more than 135 species of tubers in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetic market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with cosmetic sections like the big warehouses, supported by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to gain a quota on the UK cosmetic market, evaluated at 2.8 billion pounds, which has continued to grow while sales of fashion clothing and household articles are coming back, these major cosmetic sections will be tested in 11 stores scattered by the country and will be implemented in more stores in the year that comes if their success is demonstrated.
This investment in cosmetics results from the search by supermarkets in ways to use other exposure space used for TVs, microwaves and household articles.
Sainsbury's mentioned that it would duplicate its catalogue of beauty products with the offer of up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L'Oréal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with brand areas similar to those of shops such as Boots.
The supermarket network is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products obey the vegan recipes, something increasingly required by the younger buyers.
In addition, the fragrance shop The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which opened in Croydon, southern London, last week. It is expected that the second, in Selly Oak, in Birmingham, opens near the end of the year.
Online purchases and changing food purchase habits for small daily quantities in nearby stores have led to the fact that supermarkets now have to work harder to convince customers to visit their stores.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that stores will increasingly resemble large warehouses, at a time when the supermarket chain tries to fight Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has come to install Argos sales points in hundreds of stores, having also installed a series of Habitats, since he acquired both chains two years ago, and says that this has strengthened the sales of commodities and made the most profitable acquisitions.
The company's previous attempt to renew its cosmetics and pharmacy departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a difference on the distribution of revenue from health products stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy emerges after Sainsbury's sold three years ago his pharmaceutical business with 281 points of sale to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
It was said by the company that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding in four stores a wide range of luxury brands for skin care such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and essence of our cosmetic sections to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We also invest in specialized training of colleagues, who will be available to advise the customer.
Our range of brands has been designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, the inviting environment and practical locations make us now an insurmountable point of sale of beauty products that breaks with the old ways of making purchases."
Peter Jones "hot" after Holly Willoughby left business 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, the Dragons Den star, was "furnished" after the TV show Holly Willoughby had left a business of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for the brand of articles for home and True accessories.
The business of both had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The presenter of this Morning, 37 years old, announced in Instagram that he would abandon the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragons Den Peter Jones star light by abandoning the lucrative brand in the last minute to focus on its highly profitable new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones became "furnished" when the gold girl admitted, during a tight meeting last Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business (their value may rise to 1.5 million pounds) meant that she would stop having time to dedicate herself to her brand of household items and True accessories.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37 years old, announced in Instagram that he would leave Truly, Jones caught a plane for one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said, "Truly was far above Holly's priorities.
It would mean a long-term resolution of its future and would be financial support for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone absolutely frightened.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday... was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of items ready to sell at the headquarters in Marlow."
Experts believe that this Morning presenter, who is among the most lucrative stars in Britain, will be able to cost the company millions, given the advanced investment in products, which go from lunches and watch the clothes and articles for the home, and the potential for additional delays in the launch.
In addition, it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and Dan Baldwin's husband, are close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp ten years ago.
Willoughby created True with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined the project as president in March.
Couples make vacations together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is about to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a presentation of the I'm The Celebrity of ITV.
A nearby source of Jones said last night that "We do not intend to comment on his business".
Hard conversation "and then we fell in love"
The President of the United States referred to the criticisms that he would be the target of the media by making a comment that some would consider "indignity of a president" and by revealing such a positive attitude to the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump said, in his fake voice of "telejornal pivo".
"I didn't give up on anything."
He said that Kim was interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, and stressed that it would be a big step in the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations for denuclearisation are drawing up.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "corresponding " response from the United States to the first steps towards the disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, he said, the US continues with sanctions designed to maintain pressure.
Trump adopted a more optimistic point of view in his speech at the beginning.
"It's running very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to go into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been dead.
We now have this excellent relationship."
Trump said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim led to positive results: the end of the fire tests, support in the liberation of hostages and the return to the country of the mortal remnants of American soldiers.
In addition, he defended his uninvited approach when he spoke in his relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this superheated arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia cause destruction on an island, causing the deaths of hundreds of people
In the heat of the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was said to foreign non-governmental organizations that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population had been displaced, there was no national disaster, a pre-requisite for channelling international aid.
"Unfortunately, they were, in many cases, clear to say that they are not asking for international aid; therefore, it becomes a bit difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team that will head to Palu, there is still no guarantee that foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson for the national disaster response agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Despite the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains terribly ill prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although built in Aceh, shelters against tsunamis are not commonly seen in other coastal lines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a series of tsunami alarms in Palu, a poor degree of validity of a warning, had contributed to the loss of lives.
In the most favorable times, traveling among many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to deal with earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of this new disaster.
President Joko Widodo, who made the improvement of the infrastructure decreases a central part of his electoral campaign, spent enormous amounts on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected Mr Joko's executive, at a time when he faces his re-election in the coming year.
The president is also pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority of Muslims adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were evicted while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using catanas, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
View: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool makes a long finish for the empathic goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved a Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League against Chelsea, with a goal on the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a passage from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's ball, with his team losing for 1-0.
He gave a touch to his left before he made a finish towards the second track.
In the attempt, the ball flew high over the big area when heading to the top right corner of the network.
In the end, the ball fell on a Kepa Arrizabalaga on a flight and fell inside the network.
"I was just trying to reach that position, to go to the ball, and the players like Shaq made as much progress as possible, so I was just making as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I got a touch, and I didn't think too much about it. I just finished."
Chelsea won 1-0 at the range after marking a goal at the 25th minute of the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In this game, the advanced blues gave a step back to Mateo Kovacic before unmarking near the midfield and perform a sprint towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick mid-field pass.
Then he made a beautiful finish that crossed the counter-defence, leading Hazard to the great area.
This one crossed the defenses and made the goal against the network of the second beam with a finish with the left foot that passed through the Alisson Becker's network of Liverpool.
Liverpool faces Naples in the team phase of the League of Champions at three from Wednesday afternoon, at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face the videoton at the UEFA Europe League at 3 p.m. in London.
Number of deaths in tsunamis in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia rose to 832, declared the country's disaster response agency at the beginning of Sunday.
There are reports that describe a large number of people imprisoned in the ruins of buildings that emerged during the magnitude earthquake 7.5 on Friday, which triggered waves reaching the 6 meters high, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the agency, said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the ruins of the buildings that had disappeared.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man for murder after a woman's disappearance to death
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found this morning at Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The victim, 44 years old, was found at 7:55 a.m. in the morning with cutting gun injuries at Grayson Mews, on John Street, having a 32-year-old man arrested for murder.
The police urged the population of the area that could have witnessed something to give information.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to all those who were in John Street's immediate presence at Birkenhead and who were present with some suspicion that they would contact us.
I would also like to appeal to those who may have obtained pictures with taxi cameras, especially taxi drivers, who can contact us because they may have crucial information for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was resident in Birkenhead and was located within a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe to know the victim went to the site of the incident to investigate the place where she had been found this morning.
The investigations are under way, and the police have mentioned that they are currently reporting to the relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to access his apartment, but was informed by the police that entrances or exits from the building are prohibited.
When he was informed of what had happened, he was speechless.
The residents are now being informed that they will only be able to return to their homes from time to time.
A police officer was heard to tell a man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the dinner bath in tears.
Repeatedly affirms that "it's so horrible."
At two o'clock in the afternoon, two police cars were within the cordon and another was stationed in the area immediately outside.
A number of police officers within the cordon were highlighted to watch the apartment building.
We ask who has information that you contact by DM @MerPolCC, contact 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers through the number 0800 555 111 indicating the register 247 of 30 September.
Parliament's Cromwell statue became the most recent monument swallowed by the contents of "historic revisionism"
Their removal would constitute an act of poetic justice for their destruction, which recalls the perpetuity of the Taliban, of so many English cultural and religious artifacts, and which was carried out by their fanatic Puritan followers.
However, Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "a crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that, in the current debate on the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell's figure next to the Palace of Westminster would become a target to be destroyed.
The iconoclasty of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed by the acts of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's author, is a witness of the opinion of the 19th century and of the history of a figure that many still believe to be worthy of honor.
Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is faced by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
Whether or not this is an entirely necessary description is the subject of a further historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure with individual notoriety that represents a side of this division.
His successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of honor and commemoration."
Killer pigs attack and kill Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to reports of local media.
The man, identified only by his name "Yuan", was found dead, with a cut and covered blood artery, close to a pocket in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, read in the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig farmer prepares to inject pigs vaccines in a pig culture on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, you will have traveled with the prince from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found a door to a nearby village.
In that pocket, he said, there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the pig had attacked the pig until death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were covered with blood and smashed, said the cousin, referred to by his so-called "Wu", according to Guiyang Evening News.
The security cameras footage show Yuan entering the market at 440 a.m. on Thursday to feed their pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been closed to prevent other people from attacking while the police collected evidence at the scene.
Reports state that the Yuan family and the market authorities are negotiating a compensation for their death.
Although rare, cases of swine attacks on human beings have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their fifth in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a pig with 300 kilos immobilized a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the woman managed to scare the animal.
After a Oregon farm had been eaten by its pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the smell of blood can work as "stimulant".
"They're just playing.
They like to beautify, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them due respect," he said.
Rest of the pink hole should bring strong generalized rain to the southwest of the United States
As expected, the Rosa storm is weakening when moving on the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, it will bring torrential rains to the entire north of Mexico and to the south-west of the United States in the next few days.
At 5 o'clock in the morning, on the east of Sunday, the Rosa caused a row of 137 km/h, a category 1 hole, located 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
However, it begins to take shape a depression on the Pacific Ocean that moves to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the peninsula of Lower California, Rosa, now a tropical storm, will start pushing a strong tropical humidity towards the north in the south-west US area.
On Monday, it will cause precipitation which can reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At that time, tropical humidity interacting with the approximate depression will produce strong generalized rains in the southwest in the next few days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain may cause dangerous sudden floods, flooded with debris and possibly landslides in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause precipitations that may reach 5-7 mm in point areas, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 mm of precipitation were expected in southwestern areas, especially on much of Arizona.
Sudden floods with rapid aggravation conditions are possible due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is highly inadvertent to walk in the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rains.
The strong precipitation can make the sliders turn into good rivers and the encounters will bring strong bridge winds and dust clouds.
The approaching depression will bring with it strong precipitation over parts of the southern coast of California.
Total precipitations of more than 12 mm may be possible, which may cause small incisions of debris and passageways.
This may be the first precipitation of the region's wet station.
They will begin to take place in Arizona some tropical waters scattered at the end of Sunday and at the beginning of Monday, before the rain becomes more scattered at the end of Monday and on the third.
The strong rain will spread on the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last up to fourth.
The month of October can record strong temperature changes throughout the U.S. territory as the Arctic cools down. However, the tropical areas will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes in short distances.
There is an excellent example of the drastic differences in temperature throughout the central U.S. area on Sunday.
There is a difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the persistent summer heat will tend to increase and expand again.
It is expected that much of the central and eastern U.S. area will start in October, with temperatures ranging from 27 to 30 degrees from the South Plains to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York can reach the 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above average in the eastern United States until the end of the first half of October.
Over 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people attended six television stations yesterday at Brett Kavanaugh's kidnapper's testimony, appointed to the Supreme Court, and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse allegedly occurring in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
However, the political impasse continued, with the stations interrupting regular programming due to a turnaround of the last hour: an agreement drawn up by the Senator of Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Commission that he had absolute certainty that Kavanaugh had beaten her while drunk and tried to take her off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflamed witness, said he has absolute certainty that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, numbered by Nielsen on Friday, attended the hearing.
The company accounted for the average number of viewers in the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
The number of other stations that transmitted it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, was not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring hearings of those who see programs in offices.
To give some perspective, this is a level of hearings similar to the end of an American football game or the Oscar ceremony.
The Fox News Channel, whose commentators gave their strong support to the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the hearing that lasted all day, referred to Nielsen.
The ABC was seconded by 3.26 million spectators.
Next comes CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen referred to.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of the Friday drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement stating that his vote would be in favor of Kavanaugh, the senator was caught by the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning to be verbally attacked by demonstrators when he tried to enter a lift to address a hearing of the Judicial Commission.
The senator remained motionless to look to the ground while he was criticized directly to the CNN cameras.
"I'm here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that "you have power while so many women have no power."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, that he would say more at the committee hearing.
The cable and radio stations were all covering the event in just hours later, when the Judicial Commission was voting to make the appointment of Kavanaugh continue for a vote in plenary session of the Senate.
However, Flake said that he would only do so in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against him during the next week, which the democratic minority had come to demand.
Flake was partly convinced after talking to his friend, democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and then with some other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, since it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation by the FBI into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of "making politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critics of her plans to abandon the European Union to "make politics" with Britain's future and to harm national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, arrives at the Conservatory Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
Another interview with which he gave on the first page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on what is known as the Minister's "Checkers Plan" for Brexit, stating that a proposal that provides for Britain and the EU to cover the tariffs of the other party is "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims Homicide: police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson of the LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect of Sims' death shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player in the LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, aged 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department's communication.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, with police claiming that Sims lost his eyes during the fight.
The police recovered them at the scene and declared that they had found Simpson's DNA in them, told WAFB, a CBS subsidiary.
After questioning Simpson, the police said that this guy had killed Wayde with a firearm.
A loan of USD 350,000 was established, the lawyer said.
The medical-legal office of the East Baton Rouge parish issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a bullet wound in the head extending to the neck.
The department reports that the collaboration of the action group of the Louisiana State Police, the criminal lab of the state police, the South University police and residents of the area who collaborated in the investigation led to this detention.
LSU's athletic director, Joe Alleva, thanked the authorities in the area for their "diligence and effort to obtain justice".
Yes, he was 20 years old.
This advanced, 1,98 m high, grew in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Its average was 5.6 points and 2.6 highlights per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU Will Wade's basketball coach said the team was "destroyed" and "in shock" for Wade's death.
"That's what we're worried about for eternity," Wade said.
Volcano casts ashes in Mexico City
Eminent ashes of the Popocatepetl volcano reached the south-east of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans on Sunday to stay away from the volcano after a resumption of activity in the Crater, which recorded 183 emissions of gas and ashes within 24 hours.
The center has detected numerous deaf and trembling noises.
Images in the social networks showed fine layers of ashes covering the car crashes in the neighborhoods of Mexico City like Jochimilco.
Geophysics recorded an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 72 kilometres from the capital, provided that a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit the central area of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Comparisons between the Catalan police and separatists before the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after confrontations between independent protesters and the intervention police, while thousands of people joined the rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizer referring to Catalan on the secession.
A group of masked separatists, disturbed by the intervention police, touched her with eggs and threw ink in dust, creating dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
There were also confrontations later, in which the police used batons to contain the conflicts.
For a few hours, independent groups that sang "Don't forget, don't forgive" faced unionist protestors, who shouted "Long life for Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment of minor injuries suffered in protests, can be read in the local press.
The tensions remain high in the region inclined to independence, one year after the 1 October referendum which was considered illegal by Madrid, but which was celebrated by the Catalan separatists.
The voters chose the independence in a devastating way, although the flow to the urns had been low, with a majority boycott of those against.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to block the current vote in voting tables spread by the region, resulting in violent confrontations.
Independent groups had camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support to the national police.
Although this event has been performed, it was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year, we lived our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy because they can vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although they have won a vital but tangential victory in the regional elections in December, the Catalan independent parties have had difficulties keeping the momentum this year, with their most well-known leaders in voluntary exile or in detention to await trial for their role in the organisation of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who registered the protest in support of the police with his phone, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"He's becoming more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been detained for trial since last year, announced that he would apply to the European Parliament in the elections next year.
"Presenting me as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression that we see on the part of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car hit against a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car hit several times in a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at the Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m., British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage occurred in the gates and in the building itself.
At a certain point, someone may also have shot a beast against the car.
Menga's attack gives a 1-0 victory to Livingstone against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingstone secured the victory
Livingstone, promoted to the first division, frightened the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second defeat of only two in 18 games as an Ibrox club technician.
Dolly Menga's attack made the difference, at a time when Gary Holt's team changes level, with the Hibernian in second place.
The Gerard team, which continues without a victory out of the house in the first division this season, faces the Hearts leaders, with more than eight points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will face the Rapid Vienna in the European League at home on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone has expanded to six games its succession of unbeatable confrontations in the division, with main coach Holt without losing once since he replaced Kenny Miller in the past month.
Livingston loses opportunities against disturbed visitors
Holt's team should have advanced in the marker long before the goal, because the incisive character of their game was causing all sorts of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but he let himself be dragged in front of the bullet and then Alan Lithgow managed only to direct his effort far after he had slipped to find Craig Halkett's head on the bullet.
The house team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of her, knowing that it could cause problems for visitors in the ball games.
And that's how the crucial goal came up.
Rangers gave a free and Livingston got an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to take the pass to Menga, which gave a touch and scored from the center of the big area.
At this point, Rangers dominated the ball's possession, but he faced a defense of the impenetrable house team, and Liam Kelly's network guard had no big problems.
This pattern continued in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly into a defense.
Scott Pittman was frustrated by the ranks of Rangers' network guards, Allan McGregor, and Lithgow gave a shot away from another Livingstone stop ball game.
They continued to come crossings to the great area of Livingstone, which were subsequently solved, and two claims of great criminality, one after Halkett's investment on the Glenn Middleton replacement and the other after one hand, were rejected by the arbitrator.
Livingstone "phenomenal" analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland on Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingstone.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to exceed expectations in this upward trajectory.
Their game style and staff have changed little since their return to the major teams, but it is necessary to commend Holt for the way he galvanized the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was a colloquy, achieving an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall to give the maximum during the game.
Whatever the case, Rangers has revealed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality shown by Gerrard at times, the team was very close to these standards.
Its final game was little inspired (only once they were able to open the home team), constituting a kind of warning to the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is received ambitiously in Cologne
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for a breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, whose objective was to repair relations between NATO allies.
The difference involved issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new and huge mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside its country.
The police have claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25 000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters pointed out the presence in the urgents to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also became heard, condemning both the president's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The antagonistic protests reflect the divisionist character of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred close to the crossing of Bestwod Street with Evelyn Street, a street driven in Deptford, west of the city, close to 10 a.m., British summer time.
The driver stopped and an interview team, but the cyclist died at the site.
This collision occurs months after the death of another cyclist in a collision with escape on the Children Street, about a mile and a half of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the agents are trying to identify the person and inform his family.
There were barriers and deviations to buses, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six agents injured in disorders
Six prison officers were injured in a high-security male prison, the Prison Office reported.
The still ongoing disturbances began at the HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 0930 hours, British summer time on Saturday.
Special agents called "Tronado" to solve the problem, which involves eight prisoners and is restricted to one wing.
Agents received treatment for small facial injuries on the site.
A spokesperson for the Prison Services said: "Specially trained teams were used to resolve the current incident at the HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received treatment for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it must be made clear that the names of those responsible will be communicated to the police and they will be able to spend more time behind the ranks."
The HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, some of them the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
Furthermore, in October last year, agents of the intervention police were summoned to resolve a serious disturbance in which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Furacão Rosa threat Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (the areas affected by drought can benefit)
It is rarely a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but it is exactly what is expected for the beginning of next week, when the remaining energy of the Rosa storm passes through the southwest Desert, involving the risk of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued sudden flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday, for the south and east of Nevada, for the south of California and for Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct tour of Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching at the end of Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported on a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of tropical storm or depression in a radius of 300 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 60 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Furacone Center provide 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated quantities that can reach the 15 mm in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest Desert, such as the Central Rock Mountains and the Great Bacia, will be able to receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of isolated totals that can reach 10 mm.
For those not affected by the risks of sudden floods, the rain of the Rose may be a blessing, because the region is affected by the drought.
Although the floods are a very serious concern, part of this precipitation can be beneficial, as the southwest is currently being affected by the drought.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, little more than 40% of Arizona suffers at least extreme drought, the second most serious category," the weather.com site reported.
First, the Rosa storm will reach the continental mass through the peninsula of Baja California, Mexico.
The Rosa, still with force of lightning on Sunday morning, with wind speeds up to 137 km/h, is 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, in Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it's weakening.
Thus, it is expected that it reaches the coastal zone in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or when it falls from Monday night.
Strong precipitation may occur in parts of Mexico, resulting in a significant risk of flooding.
"A total precipitation of 8-10 mm from Baja California to the north-west of Sonora is expected, with a maximum of 25 mm," the weather.com website reported.
The Rosa will then head north, crossing Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the first hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. It will then head south of Utah in the last hours of Tuesday night.
"The main expected danger of the Rose or its reefs is the very high precipitation in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and in the southwest of the U.S. Desert," said the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to produce sudden and inundated floods of deserts, with risk of life, and shelters in mountainous lands.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three male adolescents and a 20-year-old man were arrested for murder after a 16-year-old boy had been found with cutting gun injuries in Somerset.
The adolescent was found injured in the area of the Excelsior Terrace of Midsomer Norton, close to 4 a.m., British summer time on Saturday.
It was transported to the hospital, where it remains "stable".
During the night, a 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-olds, and a 20-year-old man in the Radstock area were arrested, reported Avon and Somerset police.
Agents have called on everyone who can have mobile footage of the event that they present.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "was a victim of evil and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of rejection of the implacable and ultrasonic tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a committee in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "was a victim of malice and anger" of the Democratic Party during its nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed to the Congress on Thursday, with a strong and emotional contempt for Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he had sexually abused her for decades when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified in the hearing on his claim.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people testified to Kavanaugh's brilliantism, quality and courage that day.
"A vote of confirmation by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of confirmation of one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant public service curriculum," said a number of supporters of West Virginia.
The President later referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of republican affluence to the polls in the interim elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not competing, but I'm actually competing," he said.
"That's why I'm going all the way to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump argued that the democrats are in a mission of "resistance and obstruction.
The first procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, CNN said a senior member of the leadership of the Republican Party.
Hundreds of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia; the number continues to rise
At least 384 people died, many of them dragged by the giant waves that hit the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had met for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves with up to six meters high landed on the beach late, dragging many to death and causing a devastating trail on their way.
The tsunami occurred following a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the threat of tsunamis arose yesterday, people were still in their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, having been victims of the accident," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the agency to reduce the effect of Indonesia's (BNPB) disasters in a communication in Jacarta.
"The tsunami didn't move alone: it pulled cars, trunks, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved in the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before reaching the coastal line.
Some people trip the trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The air photographs published by the agency show a lot of destroyed buildings and stores, deformed and demolished bridges, and a mixed water.
The coastal city continued to be swept away by replicas on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated in a statement that energy released by the huge avalanche of Friday was about 200 times the power of the large atomic bomb on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's geography, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have amplified the size of the tsunami, is read in the statement.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had disappeared.
Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of the broken buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage can be deeper along the coast line 300 km north of Palu, an area called Dongala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely incapacitated and there was no information" about Dongala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 inhabitants in the area," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can worsen much more," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities said that the waves had emerged at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur film released on social networks, you can see a man on the top floor of a building screaming frenzy warnings that the tsunami is approaching, for people on the street below.
In a few minutes, a water wall fell on the coast, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the filming.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive cut in energy that interrupted communications in the area of Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began to send cargo aircraft with Jacarta help and other cities. However, the evacuations still desperately need food and other basic products.
The city airport was opened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo marked a visit to Palau's evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of deaths in the tsunami in Indonesia increases exponentially to over 800.
It's too bad.
Although he has managed to reach the city of Palu safely, where the staff are housed in shelters in the yard of his offices, the staff of World Vision de Dongala crossed the devastating scenes on his way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's too bad.
Even when the relief groups began to begin the dark task of assisting the victims of the disaster, some complained that the highly experienced workers of foreign aid were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and foreign personnel can only be accessed if it is declared "national disaster zone".
It hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a level of provincial catastrophe," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says "OK, this is a national disaster", we can open the doors to international assistance, but this status still does not exist."
When the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunamis of Friday, friends and relatives of the still missing still remained the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that attenuated the dark spots of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was removed from an outage.
On Sunday, the relief workers released a woman who had been trapped in the trash for two days next to the mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the national team of paragliding Indonesia, had trained two of his missing athletes for the Asian Games, completed at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Other prisoners at Hotel Roa Roa, including Mr. Mandadi, were his students.
"As a senior parachute practitioner, I have to carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon said that, in the hours after the news of the collapse of Hotel Roa Roa began to circulate among the paragliding community, he sent desperately messages to whatsApp for the sportsmen of Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages produced only a grey check mark instead of a pair of blues.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take 26 750 USD during automatic box refill in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed 26 750 USD to an officer of Brink's who repatriated an automatic box in Newport on the Levee, according to a report from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an automatic box in the fun complex and preparing to introduce more money, according to Detective Dennis McCarthy in the communiqué.
While he was busy, another man "runs behind the Brink's staff" and stole a bag of money that was intended for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Those who have information about their identities should contact the Newport police by number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper rename for Ye
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name--to Ye.
In announcing this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "To be previously known by Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, received some Ye and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before your participation in Saturday Night Live, where you are expected to present your new Yandhi album.
This intervention is intended to replace the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled it for "emotional reasons", informed the creator of the show.
At the same time as an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has a religious meaning for him, according to West.
"I think "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West at the beginning of this year, when he commented on the title of his album with the Big Boy radio presenter.
"So it's you, it's me, it's us, it's us.
They come from Kanye, which means "one", for only Ye - being just a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, of everything.
The album is another reflection of who we are."
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known alternately by Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also used variations of his name with or without hyphen and maesculines.
In Mexico, AMLO undertakes not to use military against civilians
The elected Mexican president Andres Manuel López Workers pledged not to use the military force against civilians, at a time when the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
López Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people".
Militarys shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a number of deaths that may have risen to 300, when left-wing student movements were deployed throughout Latin America.
López Obrador committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and opening more public universities.
The president said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag young people into gangs of criminals.
The US should double funding for artificial intelligence
At a time when China is strengthening its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the research costs in this field, said the investor and professional in the Kai-Fu Lee area, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments take place after several departments of the U.S. government have made announcements related to the IA, even though the country does not have a comprehensive formal strategy on the matter.
However, China presented its plan last year: it aims to lead innovation in IA by 2030.
"Duplicate the IA research budget would be a good start, since all the other countries are so behind the US and we are looking for the new revolution in IA," Lee said.
Duplicate funding can double the chances of the next great success of IA being achieved by the United States, Lee told NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent IA companies in China, face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an IA system that defeated Othello's best-class American player. Later, he performed executive functions in Microsoft Research and was president of the Google branch in China.
Lee credited the previous U.S. government technological contests as the Robotics Challenge Agency Agency of the Department of Defence for Advanced Research Projects and asked when it would be next, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
US researchers often have a great deal of effort to obtain state funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that's stealing academic leaders; it's companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired universities to work in IA.
Lee said that changes in immigration policies could also help the US to implement its efforts in the field of IA.
"I was of the opinion that green cards should be automatically granted to doctors in IA," he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Plan for the Development of the Artificial Intelligence of the Next Generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to that used by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to finance researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the United States Department of Defence set up a Joint Centre of Artificial Intelligence, which aims to involve partners in the industry and the academic environment, and the White House announced the formation of the restricted Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month an investment of $2 billion in an initiative designated by AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than USD 100 million per year in IA research.
However, the legislation of the United States that was intended to establish a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence did not go forward months ago.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change of country name
Macedonians voted on Sunday to decide on the change of the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", an initiative that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that blocked its requests for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its neighbour in the north represents a claim on its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposal for a new name, but the opposition nationalists argue that the change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of the Macedonian population, mostly Slavic.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the flow to the urns would be sufficient to meet the 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The rapporteur's question was, "Is it in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying to continue the accession efforts in agencies with the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that have emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I come today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the auspices of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the rapporteur is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament said that he would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The National Elections Committee stated that there had been no record of irregularities until one afternoon.
However, the fluctuation was only 16% compared to 34% obtained in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of the registered voters appeared to vote.
"I have voted for my children; our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a capital elector, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in the referendum on the change of country name, which would open the door for his accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents mounted by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are by NATO and the EU, but we want to join the service door with an elevated head and not with the service door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you don't want to receive us as Macedonia, we can address others as China and Russia to become part of the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO entry will bring much needed investments to Macedonia, which record a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
According to him, a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future".
A survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required flow.
Another survey, conducted by Telma TV from Macedonia, found that 57% of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote.
For the referendum's success, the flow must be more than 50% more than one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first major disaster in the policy of the pro-Western government since it took hold in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero do Manchester City crosses the entire Brighton defense towards the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling forgot Brighton's defense in the 2-0 victory against Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
I'll make it look ridiculously easy on your neck in a minute 65.
The Argentinian advanced received a pass in the middle field at the beginning of the game.
He made a sprint between three Brighton defenses before cutting to reach an open field.
He was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He made a defense before neutralizing the race more in the borders of the great area of Brighton.
Then he took a walk to his left, where he was Sterling.
The advanced English used its first touch in the big area to return the ball to Aguero, who, with the right boot, defeated Brighton Mathew Ryan's netguard with a finish to the right side of the network.
"Aguero is arguing with some problems at his feet," he told reporters Pep Guardiola, city coach.
"We promised he'd play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he had marked a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage against the Premier League.
That goal was marked at 29 minutes.
Aguero got the ball well in Brighton's territory in that game.
He took a walk on the defenses along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
This gave some touch before driving Sterling towards the second track.
Sky Blues' advance hit the ball for the network immediately before sliding off the border of the field.
The city faces the Hoppenheim in the group phase of the Champions League at 12.55 a.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make Rockies' life difficult
With the Nationals removed from the end, there were not many reasons to force another start.
However, always competitive Scherzer has hopes to enter the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications regarding the end for the Rockies, which hold a leadership of a game about the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a victory of 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still intend to ensure their title of the first division.
"Although we're playing for nothing, at least we can go into the field knowing that the environment here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the maximum level that I could face this year.
Why would I not want to compete in those conditions?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the launcher's title for Sunday, but there are those who say they are inclined to allow Scherzer to launch in this situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, held a session in the bullpen on Thursday and would launch in his normal position on Sunday.
Washington's right player goes 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts on 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump begins in West Virginia
The President later referred to the situation involving his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he mentioned the importance of republican influence in the inter-hour elections.
"All we've done is in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not competing, but I'm competing, and that's why I'm fighting for excellent candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump went on, "They're seeing this horrible, horrible group of radical democrats, they're seeing it happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power using all the necessary means.
They don't care who they deal with, who they have to go through to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, have the task of "resisting and obstructing".
"And they saw it in the last four days," he said, calling it "aggressive, evil, absurd and false" to the democrats.
The president referred to the name of Diane Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judicial Committee, and received bad public sounds.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did you get the escape of the document?
Whoa, whoa, what?
No, um, no, I, wait, one - that was a even bad body language - the worst body language I ever saw."
The Labour Party has ceased to be inclusive.
It is intolerant to those who openly give their opinion
When the Momentum activists of my local party organization voted to censor me, it wasn't a surprise to me.
At the end of the day, I am the most recent of a number of Labour Members in Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome - all because we openly express our views.
My colleague in Parliament Joan Ryan was the target of a similar treatment because he has resolutely faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticised me for contradicting Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement to Nottingham East's Labour Meeting in the sixth fair mentioned that "we assume that the meetings are inclusive and productive".
During most of my eight years as a local worker representative in parliament, the meetings of the General Committee were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today, it has ceased to be the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of "more kind and gentle" policy has been forgotten, if it has ever been realized.
It has become increasingly apparent that the different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that each opinion is judged whether or not it is acceptable by the party's leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy took the lead, because the colleagues with whom he thought he shared a similar political perspective began to expect me to return and assume positions with which he would never agree - either on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public (and it doesn't really matter what I say), there's a torrent of insults in the social networks that call for "reparation", reporting the policies of the centre, telling me that I don't have to belong to the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one who's going through this.
In fact, I know that I have more luck than some of my colleagues, since the comments I have been addressed tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who face a barring of sexist or racist insults every day, but who never give up in front of them.
One of the most disillusioned aspects of this era of politics is how these levels of insult have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we have stopped being inclusive, and with each motion of "censorship" or change of selection rules the party narrows its views.
I have received numerous advice over the past two years, urging me to keep my head down, not to be so expressive, and that this would "be all right" to me.
But that's not why I came to make politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party for 32 years as a student, implicated by the neglect of the Thatcher government that left the classroom of my school, which is literally in ruins, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need them most, either as an author or as a minister in the government.
I've never hidden my policies, including in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been somewhat confused about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country is headed for a Brexit that will harm families, companies and our public services, not understanding the desire to waste time and energy on the subject of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the message I have is not for the Momentum of Nottingham; it is for my constituents, members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of "reparation" or political expeditions will prevent me from acting in the sense of what I believe to be the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the unbeatable Ayr goes to the top
Two late tests sent the result somehow, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to succeed in this incredibly interesting game of Tennnet's Premiership of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only ten without defeats.
In the end, it was a superior defense and better risk management that made the home team bring the best, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games so far and we're still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "The merit goes to Ayr. They manage the risks better than we do."
Grant Anderson's trial in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, placed Ayr in the front, but a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, given to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to express the numbers, having Jason Baggot took advantage of an unconverted trial.
Climo extended the advantage of Ayr with a great penalty, before, immediately before mid-time, having marked and then converted a soil test to place the marker on 17-5 for Ayr at the interval.
However, Melrose well started the second part and Patrick Anderson's trial, converted by Baggot, reduced the disadvantage to five points.
There was a long interruption due to a serious injury by Ruarid Knott, who was transported from maca to the outside and, after resumption, Ayr strengthened leadership with a trial by Stafford McDowall converted by Climate.
Ayr's executive captain, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card and once again Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with an unconverted trial of Bruce Colvine at the end of an intense pressure invested.
However, the house team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for having destroyed Climo without the ball, at the launch of the penalty, MacPherson placed the ball on the ground behind the evil in progress of Ayr.
Climo converted, as he had almost immediately followed him to the reinstatement, after Kyle Rowe had picked up David Armstrong's kick box and sent Gregor Henry's wing to the fifth test of the house team.
Still Game star ready for a new career in the restaurant business
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, seems ready to enter the restaurant sector after knowing that a licensed restaurant company was appointed director.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, who writes and participates with the long-term comedian partner Greg Hemhill.
The couple announced that the ninth season, staring soon, will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is director of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, even though a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was intending to engage in the "flowering business of the restoration of Glasgow".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a land unspoiled from the coast, hopes that the court will restore a path to the Pacific
Marines patrol a covered ship base of rope in La Paz.
Public buildings feature a blue-marine flag.
The ship bases of Lake Titicaca for the Amazon point to the motto: "The sea is our right.
Getting it is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia, a landlocked country, is still living the memory of a lost coastal line for Chile in a bloody conflict with resources in the 19th century, as well as the desire to sail once again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be at the highest point in the decades, since Bolivia is awaiting a judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course it is a positive perspective on the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the issuing of the TIJ judgment on giant screens scattered by the country, hoping that the Hague court will resolve in favor of its country's claim, so that, after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election in the coming year, also has a lot in play in the Monday judgment.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," the president's votes were last August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will act in favour of Bolivia, and that it would not change much even if it did.
The United Nations agency, based in the Netherlands, has no powers to assign Chilean territory to another country and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
Only six months after the final allegations were heard indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have damaged it.
"The issue of access to the sea was kidnapped by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
The belligerent rhetoric of Morales struck some good-willed Chilean remnant, he suggested.
At a future time, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain the dialogue after this.
The two countries have not changed ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in Haia, rejected the idea that the court's decision process was innocuously quick.
The next Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, another one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political crusade.
"Bolivia will never deviate from its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we must go beyond the past."
North Korea claims there will be no disarmament without the country trusting in the US
The Foreign Minister of North Korea Ri Yong Ho said his nation would never give up its nuclear weapons if it did not trust Washington first.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
In his speech, he urged the United States to fulfil the promises they made during a summit in Singapore among the leaders of the rival countries.
Your comments arise when the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be ready to resume nuclear diplomacy in impasse, more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said that it is an impossible dream to consider that the continued sanctions and the objection of the United States to a declaration that puts an end to the Korean war will sometimes lead the North to resign.
Washington was afraid to accept the statement without Pyongyang taking the first significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US president Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread ceticism about Pyongyang really intends to reduce an arsenal that the country is probably the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo planned to visit Pyongyang in the month that comes to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of huge hats on the way to a store near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't need to look any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the pass a series of extravagance hats and oversized for their spring-summer 2019 collections, which left the style set in Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very little practical hats and these designers sent these amazing creations to the passerby.
Valentine's most outstanding piece was an extravagant bege hat decorated with a wide abate similar to a pen that flooded the head of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jammed melanas of jewelry, a hat of craftsman and even a pineapple, although the same ones were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks...even in carnival time.
Many of the colored masks had boiled lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than with high sewing.
One of the creations resembled the dive equipment, with tubes and glasses, while the other looked like a frozen cone.
And if you want to continue this great statement of fashion, you're lucky.
The stylistic observers predict that these huge hats are on the way to a store near you.
The oversized hats appear effervescent on the "La Bomba" path, the straw hat with a 61 cm abate that has been used by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the very little practical hat that spread through the social networks sent another great creation for the passersby: a beach bag almost as large as the model in fact of the bathroom that transported it.
The reddish-colored orange bag, decorated with rafia strips and with a white leather stick, was the most prominent piece of the Spring-summer collection La Riviera of 2019 by Jacquemus in Paris Fashion Week.
The famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I am looking forward to seeing large hats and beach bags arriving at the shops for the next summer. Once the designer had so impact, it would be difficult to ignore the search for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
The independent schools in Scotland benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, with this trend continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in the exams, reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students scattered throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to achieve the best level of service for both students and parents.
Independent schools intend to prepare their students for the deepening of their studies and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of designing and implementing a school curriculum as a measure, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought-after theme in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If we talk to a man in a language he understands, we can get into his mind.
If we talk to him in his own language, we can get into his heart."
This quote reminds us that we cannot depend only on English when we intend to create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of the recent reviews this year, we have verified that the languages are at the top of the table, with the highest rates of use of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the maximum classification of A.
These data, collected in 74 schools under the scope of the SCIS, show that 72% of students received the highest score of A in mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that Scottish independent schools are promoting foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly serve children and young people in the future.
The languages, as an option, are now addressed in the same way as the STEM themes (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculums of independent schools and not only.
A 2014 UK Employment and Competence Commission survey concluded that 17% were concerned with the lack of language skills among employers’ difficulties.
Therefore, knowing other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential employment opportunities to demand language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have a tangible advantage in the future with a skill for life like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person in front of competition.
According to a YouTube survey of over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to keep a conversation, being French the only language spoken by a proportion of two digits, 15%.
So investing in language teaching now is important for today's children.
The domain of various languages, particularly those of developing countries, will give children with the best chances of finding employment with relevance.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom for the 2020 horizon, such as mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, there will always be a set of languages to choose in independent schools, supported by teaching staff specialized in the area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a educational environment that prepares children and gives them the skills they need for success, whatever the future reserves them.
Today, in a globalised business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance for the future of the country, so it is necessary to reflect it in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to make this option available with diversity and excellence for young Scottish people.
It needs to be done well.

LeBron starts at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting is about to end for fans who want to see LeBron James get started in Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, a coach of the Lakers, announced that James will participate in the opening game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes will play is still to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
The Laker journalist Mike Trudell published a tweet claiming that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was interrogated on his plans for the calendar of six Lakers games in the pre-time period.
"I don't need pre-time games at this stage of my career to be ready," he said.
Time and YouTube channel of Trump's start in West Virginia
President Donald Trump launches a campaign round tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five commissions scheduled for next week, which include standings in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of censure pending for his election for the wave of the Supreme Court, Trump intends to strengthen support for the interim elections to be held shortly, since the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the vote in November.
What time is Trump's beginning in West Virginia tonight and how do you see him online?
Trump's start in Wheeling, West Virginia, is marked for 7 a.m., East Time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can attend Trump's launch in West Virginia online below on live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably address this week's hearings to Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, who have become tense due to allegations of sexual abuse.
However, the main objective of this comical torrent is to help Republicans, who face difficult elections in November, to gain some momentum.
Thus, the leaders of President Trump's campaign said that these five commissions intend to "give energy to volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they maintain in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so fundamental to the president's agenda that he will visit as many states as possible, as we approach the excitement of the campaign season," said a spokesman for Trump's campaign that he gave up on being quoted, told Reuters.
Marked for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the start of the night will attract supporters "from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get coverage of the communication media in Pittsburgh area", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time this month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the West Virginia Senate Patrick Morrisey, undermining the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him help in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team demonstrates that it has the strength to fight to keep the hope alive before the singles of Sunday
After three uniform sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum oscillation of the impulse is a completely invented sport concept, but it is one in which players truly believe, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where did they say the impotence will come now?
"They have an advantage of six points and now there are four, so we're dealing with this as a little bit of a push, I'd say," said Jordan Spieth while he was out of the field at the end of the day.
Europe is in advantage, of course, with four points forward and with more than twelve at stake.
Americans, as Spieth says, still have some reserve energy and many reasons to feel encouraged, especially given the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them achieved three points in four.
Spieth has been the killer of the tea to the green and is leading by example.
Those party gutural screams were getting higher as the round continued, with a crucial putt that made the fourth departure an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind in two.
His putt that won the match on the 15th produced a similar scream, from that guy who reveals that he still believes that the American team continues to compete.
"We just need to focus and worry about our own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left of each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Speeth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed revelation of Ryder Cup.
The improbable but adorable European couple is four in four and cannot be mistaken.
The "Moliwood" was the only duet not to make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon and on Friday afternoon back.
In this series, and given the way their energy seems to flow from and to this turbulent crowd, the idea that they are the players to beat on Sunday is reinforced, and that there is no more popular player to seal a European victory potential to the sun in Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably, both at the same time in different holes.
However, the speech on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourballs this morning, while teamed with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front of the ninny threw Spanish and Swedish into a hole that they'd never been close to leaving.
However, on Sunday, no one will help them get out of it.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see from close because of the interactions between partners, the advice they give and how the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played a better team so far and has gained a significant advantage on the final day. However, this foursomes session has also shown that the US team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe with a leadership of 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will enter on the last day of Ryder Cup with a broken advantage after leaving the fourballs and foursomes of the Saturday games with a leadership of 10-6 in front of the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari's inspired duet led the load with two victories on a Tiger Woods with difficulties to get to the Le Golf National classification, so far, four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, fighting to preserve the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an unsuccessful American team in the morning's furballs, winning the 3-1 series.
The US offered more resistance in the foursomes with two winnings, but failed to reduce the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in Sunday's singles on Sunday 12 to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points followed when he and Molinari, who received some of "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are only the only duet to win four points in their four opening parts in Ryder Cup's history.
Having smashed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they greatly consolidated the advantage, defeating a Powerless Woods and American initiator Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who pulled out during two games on Saturday, revealed occasional genius access, but already lost 19 of the games he fought in fourballs and foursomes, and seven followed.
Justin Rose, resting during the fourballs in the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the first and third world rankings.
However, this pleasant day with a light breeze in south-west Paris, Europe has not always been the best.
Jordan Speeth, winner three times of the main male tournaments, and Justin Thomas defined the reference to Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duet won a bold 2&1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain, and returned later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4&3 in the foursomes, having lost the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history a team has invested a four-point disadvantage before the singles, although the Furyk team, a title-holder, just needs to empattate to preserve the trophy.
After two days in the second position, a counter-attack on Sunday seems to be beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says "don't think" to a unilateral untrustworthy disarmament
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was exacerbating mistrust in the United States and that there was no way of the country unilaterally disregarding its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "significant good-will measures" last year, such as the interruption of nuclear tests and missiles, the dismantling of the nuclear testing centre and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we do not see any corresponding US response," he said.
"Without confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way to proceed with our first disarmament."
Although Ri has recycled North-Korean complaints already known about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded as gradual steps take place, its statements appear to be significant in so far as they do not literally reject unilateral denuclearization, in contrast to Pyongyang's earlier positions.
Ri mentioned a joint statement issued by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump at the first summit held sometime between a US president in operation and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim undertook to work in the sense of "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump offered security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States claims Pyongyang has first to abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted appeals to mitigate the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "first denuclearization" and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, opposing even the "declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an impossible dream of people who don't know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the extension of sanctions is exacerbating our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been mentioned by US leaders in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: "If the party concerned was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse."
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that guiding North Korea's rockets towards the U.S. territory was inevitable after Mr. President Mau Trump had called Kim the "man of rockets" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened to "destruct completely" North Korea in the past year, has filled Kim with praise for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but has stated that there was much to be done and that the sanctions would have to continue until the denuclearization of North Korea.
On Thursday, Trump said he had no calendar for this, referring to "while two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The application of the Security Council sanctions must continue to be effective until denuclearization is complete, final and verifiable."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened the sanctions against North Korea imposed since 2006, in an attempt to stifle the financing of North Korea's nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri on the side of the UN General Assembly and declared after visiting Pyongyang again in the month he came to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that they had made progress, although then North Korea had denounced him for "making gangster demands.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to dismantle a missile installation and also a nuclear complex if the United States "take corresponding measures".
Pompey said that Kim had told you that the "responsible measures" they sought were the security guarantees taken by Trump in Singapore, as well as initiatives to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend courses that teach you to give up enough
A new course at Harvard University this year placed all its students to sleep more, an initiative to combat Machist culture to study in "rights" impregnated of caffeine.
One professor concluded that the students of this university at the top of the world ranking had often not the least idea about the most basic concepts about the care they should have with themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, who believed to be the first of his kind in the United States.
The inspiration for the course arose after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to meet me and said, "Why are you just telling me this in the last year of the course?"
The young man said that no one had ever mentioned the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, served for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance as well as to improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry of Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of University Health Services, said that the institution decided to introduce the course after concluding that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In the section there is an image of a bedroom where students click on coffee cane, curtains, shoes and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and about how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficit, and the importance of a routine to pick up the bed.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of AVC, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know it won't change the behavior of students instantly.
However, we believe that they have the right to know, as we all have the right to know the health effects of the smoking option," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "direct" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students make this a growing problem.
To ensure that we sleep enough and quality should be a "secret weapon" of the students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid being swallowed, because the deprivation of sleep puts the brain in a hunger mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian physical and chemical biology student, helped Professor Cheisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a course for the entire campus, he said.
The next step, according to its expectations, is to ask all postgraduate students to attend a similar study programme before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students weigh the use of an alarm for the time to go to bed, as well as to wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and lead the problems to sleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal to defeat the men of Gerrard
Rangers suffered another access of sadness out of the house when the Dolly Menga attack caused Steven Gerrard's disarmed team a 1-0 defeat at the Livingstone Stadium.
The Ibrox team was trying to record its first victory in its race since the 1-0 victory in St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team ended up in the second defeat of Gerard in 18 games, leaving its team eight points behind the unencumbered Hearts, the leader of the first Scottish division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first part and the Rangers collective, unsolicited, never seemed to be equal.
With the Rangers now coming down to the sixth position, Livingstone goes up to the third, and only behind the Hibernate for the difference of goals.
And there may be even more problems for Rangers after the Calum Spence line prosecutor has been treated with a head injury caused by an object apparently shot from the visitor's area.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team that exceeded Ayr in the Betfred Cup's semi-finals.
Holt, for his part, used the same eleven of Livingstone who stole a point from the Hearts last week, and will have been delighted with the way his well-run team drowned the opponents in each game.
Rangers may have dominated ball possession, but Livingstone did more with what he had.
The team could have marked after two minutes, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's ball, but the average lost its great opportunity out.
A long free trip from Keaghan Jacobs went to meet Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only managed to finish off in the direction of the second train.
Rangers managed to regain control, but hope was greater than belief in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have been awarded a great penalty at the fourth hour with his collision with Steven Lawless, but the arbitrator Steven Thomson refused the Colombian appeals.
Rangers achieved only two completions to the score in the first part, but the old Ibrox Liam Kelly network had little to worry about Lassana Coulibally's head finish and Ovie Ejaria's weak finish.
Although Livingston's goal at the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was expected of the development of the game, it is inexcusable that the team deserved it, no longer because of its tenacity.
Once again, Rangers couldn't handle a long-standing Jacobs ball game.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher took a walk to Scott Robinson, which kept calm when he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerard moved in the range, having replaced Coulibally by Ryan Kent, and this exchange almost had an immediate impact when the lateral advance passed to Morelos, but impressive Kelly made a sprint from his line to make the block.
However, Livingstone continued to force visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett to take a long walk behind a long walk.
Holt's team may have increased its advantage in the final stages, but McGregor insisted well, defending himself from Jacobs before Lithgow ends up out in the corner.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again claimed a great penalty when he got married in Jacobs, but Thomson ignored the request again.
German: Geiger's Inventory
And now a page of our Sunday Morning Sunday Sunday: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago and continues to CONTAR ...was born in Germany the physical future of Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that ended up taking the device known as Geiger counter.
The key piece of science since then, Count Geiger has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Crownado" in which the unprovable scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals as a uranium.
When we put these earpieces, we can even hear the effects of atoms released by radioactivity on minerals."
Evans: "Look, you're really screaming right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd anniversary.
But the invention he gave his name still persists.
New cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise harmful cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and its changes in the laboratory
These cells, which can "see" a common protein to many cancers, are then injected again into the body
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a number of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, saw her cancer in the ovaries disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and its laboratory modification so that they can "see" a common protein to many cancers, designated by HER2. These cells are then injected again into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "controls the growth of various types of cancer", including those of the mother, of the ovary, of the lungs and also of the dyes, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach involves removing immune cells from patients and "teaching them" to attack cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a support diatribe to Trump by throwing a MAGA hat after its appearance in the SNL.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West was released to the studio on Saturday Night Live after an inconsistent performance in which the president of the United States, Donald Trump, commended him for applying to the presidential elections in 2020.
After performing his night song, with the name of Ghost Town, in which he enlisted a hat "Make America Great", he started a bravata against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white man and he says to me, "How can you like Trump?
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have abandoned America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began with a satire with Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star cut off Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it had not been transmitted, the West Bravata scene was published on social networks by the comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to change from West when he did.
In addition, West had complained to the public that it had been a bad bit in the barns because of the hat.
"They scared me in the barns.
They said, "Don't go there with that hat."
They scared me!
And then they tell me I'm marginalized," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the marginalization?", saying that "I was following my superman's coat, because that means that nobody tells me what to do.
Try love."
His comments caused public woes and the participants in the SNL appeared to be embarrassed, he told Variety, having someone from the program said to the newspaper: "The whole studio was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with the performance of song I Love it decorated with Perrier bottle.
West received a demonstration of support from the manager of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who published the tweet: "To one of our bravest spirits: BRIGTED FOR ENFRENTING THE TURBA".
However, the interview programmer Karen Hunter posted a tweet saying that West was simply "to be what it is, and that is absolutely wonderful".
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (buying his music or supporting his "art") who I believe to be welcoming and spreading harmful ideologies to the community.
He's free.
And so do we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, claiming that he was now "the former known by Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name, following Diddy's past, also known by Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dog has already used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the missing music legend Prince changed the name to a symbol and then to "the artist previously known by Prince".
Accuse of attempted murder after defamation in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man had been stabbed in a restaurant in the eastern part of Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, said the police.
The case is scheduled to be brought before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be analysed by the public ministry.
The Battle Star of the Kit Harington Thrones Attacks Toxic Manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as a sculptor like Jon Snow in the violent series of medieval fantasy of HBO, the Thrones War.
However, the actor, at 31 years of age, attacked the stereotype of Machist hero, claiming that such wallpapers on the screen often make boys feel that they have to be hard to respect.
In a conversation with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his colleague in the Rose Leslie Thrones War, also at the age of 31, admitted that he has a "very strong position" regarding the approach to the problem.
"I have a pretty strong personal position right now: what went wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men when they are growing up in terms of the problem we are seeing now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very male characters.
And he went on, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that make young people feel that they must belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I think this is one of the big issues of our time: how can we change this?
Because obviously something went wrong for the young."
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not enter any prequel or sequelle of the Thrones War when the series ended in the next summer, referring to that for him, the "fighting camps and horses" ended.
As of November, Kit will participate in a edition of True West of Sam Shepard, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considered finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the Thrones War.
"I met my wife in this series, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from here on," she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the loving interest of the character of Kit, Jon Snow, in the series of fantasy guaranteed with Emmys.
The couple gave the note in June 2018 on the grounds of the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health authorities said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmissions through sexual relations, which marks a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was reduced to practically zero, the Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of annual homologous variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual relations is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was described in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against the LGBT community is common.
Studies estimated that, due to the country's conservative values, 70 to 90% of men who had sexual relations with other men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases result from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to anti-HIV medication as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters desperately flees information about Republican senators by a collaborator and attacks the "dangerous lies" and the "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters denied on Saturday the allegations that a member of his team would have published personal information from three members of the U.S. Senate on the pages of the Wikipedia of the legislators.
Los Angeles Democrat stated that the accusations were promoted by opinion leaders and "ultradrite" sites.
"Truths, lies, and more contemptuous lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The information published allegedly includes the residences of the houses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a hearing with a Senate panel on allegations of improper sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court.
The information escape occurred some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as the Gateway Puntit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was associated with the Waters office and published the data of a Waters staff member, reported The Hill.
"This unsubstantiated charge is totally false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My collaborator, whose identity, personal and security data were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations, had no responsibility in this information escape.
This unsubstantiated charge is totally false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly attracted online criticisms, including those of the former press secretary of the White House Ari Flescher.
"This is disgusting," Fleischer wrote.
"That suggests she doesn't have the temper to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something that is not their responsibility, they can't be angry.
You can't have a challenging position.
You can't question the defendant's motives.
You must reveal calmness and serenity."
Flescher seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing to be too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will contest Waters' place in the inter-chamber elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very serious if it's true," she read on her tweet.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had warned "the competent authorities" of these fraudulent allegations.
"We ensure that the guilty will be revealed," he continued, "and will be legally responsible for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous to all and any members of my staff."
Review by Johnny English Back to Attack - weak spying film parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashionable to look for connotations with Brexit in any new film with a British flavor, and this seems indeed to apply to the new edition in the series of comedy films and action Johnny English, launched in 2003 with "Johnny English" and brought back to life in 2011 with "Johnny English Regresso".
Is ironic self-satisfaction about being so bad the new opportunity to export to the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes gloated and an excessively elastic expression, obtained his license to create the confusion, renewed a second time - with his name to signal, more than anything, that is a comprehensive comical creation for non-anglophils.
He is, of course, the secret idiot agent who, despite his bizarre claims to a soft glamorous, has a bit of Cloiseau, a bit of Mr. Bean and something of that fulan who contributed with only one note to the theme of the film "Moments of Glory" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
In addition, his character was originally based on the international traveler and mysterious man whose role Atkinson played in the TV ads for Barclaycard, who left chaos on his track.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JE.
I love the scene where Johnny English comes close to a helicopter pushing a medieval armor, with the rotor's legs to make a noise of carriage against the cap.
Atkinson's talent for comedy is obvious, but humor sounds weak and strangely superfluous, especially considering that "series" films like 007 and the Impossible Mission now confidently propose comedy as an ingredient.
We are left with the idea that humor is directed to children and not adults, and in my opinion, Johnny English's bizarre disadvantages are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film numbers in Bean's character.
Now, the assumption, always current, is that Britain is being put into serious trouble.
A computer pirate infiltrated the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground for the consternation of the service agent, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister who incarnates a pompous and conflictous figure, already suffering a total decal of political impolarity: Emma Thompson gives his best with this role that reminds the character of Theresa May, but the argument does not give much material for large flights.
Your Secret Service Advisers inform you that, since all the agents in the asset have been committed, you will have to remove someone from the reform.
And this one is the ruined Johnny English, now working as a teacher in a small school, but giving non-official classes about how to be an infiltrated spy: here are some interesting numbers, because English offers us a spy academy in the style of the movie "School of Rock".
English is quickly taken to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and to reunite with his auxiliary companion Bow, a role played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, tied to a submarine commander, a fusing character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin of the catastrophe in the Secret Service of His Majesty are back to action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletin, a role played by Olga Kurylenko.
However, the prime minister is being dangerously emboldened by the charismatic billionaire of the technologies that claim to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the late Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough started their hate of absurd acts: discolored from table employees, lit up a sighted French restaurant, created the confusion by entering as clandestines in the luxurious island of Volta, and English launched pure anarchy as it tries to use a virtual reality eye to familiarize itself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops were certainly created in view of this last sequence, but for the most sympathetic and stormy of all, the set has a lot of TV for children.
The result is quite medium.
And as in Johnny English's other films, I couldn't stop investigating: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
Workers say they're developing a plan for British workers four days a week, but getting five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party may be considering a radical plan to provide the British with a four-day work week, but with five-day payments.
Reports suggest that the party wants the patrons to pass the savings with the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) for workers, giving them a day of additional strike.
The workers got a three-day weekend, but keeping the order.
Sources refer to the idea of "adjusting" to the party's economic programme, which redirects the country to the workers' interests.
The transition to a four-day work week obtained the favourable opinion of the Congress of Trade Unions as a form of workers taking part in economic change.
A senior leader of the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: "We hope to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
"It will not happen from one day to the other, but a four-day work week is a aspirations adjusted to the party's approach to economic rebalance for the worker, as well as the overall strategy of the party for the industrial sector."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party had already proposed a four-day work week during its campaign for the 2017 legislative elections.
However, this ambition is currently not favoured by the whole of the Labour Party.
One party spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not part of the party's policy and we are not considering it".
The minister of the shadow finance John McDonnell used the party's conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell stated that he was determined to recover the power from the hands of the "directors without face" and the "speculators" of the basic services companies.
Its plans also include the non-recovery of the total shareholding of current water companies, as the Labour Party may make 'deductions' based on the perception of illegal conduct.
McDonnell also confirmed plans to put workers in company management councils and to create inclusive ownership funds that transfer 10% of the private company's share to employees, which could be paid annually dividends that can go up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes" if the FBI's investigation to Kavanaugh can do them or not change ideas.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote of his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, raising questions as to whether the conclusions can lead Republican senators to withdraw his support.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley's correspondent asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy proved to be more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"That's when I went to the hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when this claim came up, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolved, determined, without doubt."
Graham's vote, however, seems unfavourable.
"I've decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it would be necessary for an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett made a violent disappointment," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentioned couldn't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything change again."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the city of New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with an extremely impressive list of stars that will act on an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
Already in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people in the Grand Revaldo of Central Park, not only to attend the events such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to strengthen awareness of the real objective of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of defenses that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (at least if they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the spectators had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, a phone call or any other significant ways that contribute to raising awareness for the purpose of ending poverty.
However, what was the degree of success of Global Citizens in these 12 years in achieving their goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way of convincing them to demand action, or is this just another case of "cliquetivism" - do we find that it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
The Global Citizen claims that since 2011, it has registered more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters who have exerted pressure to achieve a number of different objectives.
These actions, according to the organization, contributed to the global leaders having announced commitments and policies valued at more than $37 billion, which would affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, with at least $10 billion relating to them already disbursed or aggravated.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people scattered around the world.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the United Kingdom bringing together investors and implementers committed to "helping children to achieve their full potential", which promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help end sub-nutrition in the country. This after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like all of us, we can make the social injustice of sub-nutrition a landmark note of history," said Tracey Ullman, the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, to a crowd in a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, after more than 5000 pressure actions on the United Kingdom in terms of improving the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would finance a project, the Power of Nutrition, which would cover 5 million women and children, with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the site, "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen answers: "It was a long and tortuous path - sometimes we fell and failed.
But, like the great movements of civil and anti-apartheid rights that preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are among the artists who will perform this year's event in New York, presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
USA can use the Navy as a "block" to put a stop to Russia's energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
"If necessary," Washington may use his Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, including in the Middle East, revealed the US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, in particular where the legitimate government is invited, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they intend to mediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the south-east of Europe," he said.
And, according to the governor, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has the ability, with its marine, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to block to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants in an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In his speech, he continued to compare Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, referring to them as effective.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to slow down and replace fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "magic of a single trick" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements arise at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, the authorities of the Trump administration, including the president himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "inadequate" Nord Stream pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has become a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stated that the North Stream pipeline, budgeted at $11 billion, intends to double the existing capacity by 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons, being an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure and that consumers must have the ability to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position motivated a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), appealed to the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, chief of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will analyze deeply" the possibility of candidates to the presidency in 2020, said the Senator of Massachusetts
The Senator of the Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he "will analyze deeply" the possibility of applying to the presidency to follow the intercalary elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider the possibility of applying.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and this includes a woman as the most responsible," The Hill said.
"After 6 November, I will thoroughly analyze the possibility of applying for the presidency."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, saying that "he was taking the country in the wrong direction".
"I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been a harsh vocal critic of Trump and his appointment to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On a tweet Friday, Warren said that "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a survey conducted on Thursday revealed that the majority of Warren's own constituents were not of the opinion that it should be applied to the presidency in 2020.
59% of the "probable" voters of Massachusetts said that the senator should not apply, according to the survey of the Political Research Centre at the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe.
32% support your candidacy.
The survey revealed greater support for a candidacy of the former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a potential candidacy and 48% against.
Other prominent names of the Democratic Party debated regarding a potential candidate in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and the Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions track Palin's post-traumatic stress at Donald Trump's beginning
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after his enlistment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of an incident of domestic violence
"What my own son is going on, what's going on after I've come back, I can identify with the other families who feel the branchings of post-traumatic stress and some of the wounds with which our soldiers, in fact, are coming back," said the public of a commission in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this detention "the elephant in the room" and said that his son and other veterans "return a little different, return hardened, re-examined whether there is this respect for which his comrades soldiers and airmen, and all the other members of the armed forces, gave to the country".
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence on a woman and possession of weapons while alcoholized, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
Eleven states and the District of Colombia support the response of the new asylum policy
Twelve states and the District of Colombia are supporting a legal response from a new US policy that refuses asylum to victims who flee from gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district sent a friendly statement curiae (friends of the court) on Friday in Washington, in support of an asylum-seeker who is responding to this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complaint in the Grace vs. Sessions process that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against politics was not revealed.
The person claimed that his partner "and his children, members of a violent gang", abused her, but the US authorities ignored his asylum application on July 20th.
The complaint was arrested in Texas.
The government departments supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, such as nations facing generalized problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Resources Council allowing immigrants without documents of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Colombia Karl Racine said, in a statement on Friday, that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international laws".
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances underlying them; this prohibition violates this principle," it reads in the statement of friends curiae.
The lawyers also argued in this statement that the ban on the entry of immigrants by police has a negative impact on the US economy, referring to the fact that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "disposal of the necessary workforce".
The Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims who fled from domestic violence and gangs in June.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on ethnicity, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or with a certain political opinion," Sessions said in their policy announcement on June 11.
The asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Rescue efforts desperate in Palu when the number of dead doubles in a counter-clock to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said Risa Kusuma, 35-year-old mother of a febrile baby of male sex, comforting him in an evacuation centre in the city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance brings more bodies.
There's a shortage of clean water."
Residents were alerted to return to their ruined houses to try to save everything they could find among their water-sucked parts.
There were hundreds of wounded and the hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Harris, who broke the ribs and shoulder, rest outside the Palu Army Hospital, where the patients were treated outside due to the strong replicas they continued.
His eyes were bathed in tears when he related what he felt when the violent earthquake hit him in the hotel room of the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then, silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" with "advertising ads"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page announcement in a daily newspaper in the United States promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, referred last Thursday to China's paid supplement Daily at the Des Moines Register, the most distant newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the elections of November 6th to Congress, an accusation denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the U.S. elections marked the beginning of what the US authorities, in statements to Reuters, designated as a new phase in the growing Washington campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently making an increasingly intense trade war that has seen both sides apply tariff gaps on imports from the other.
China's retail tariffs in the initial stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states that support the Republican Trump Party, Chinese and North American specialists claim.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged workers, farmers and American companies.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "is now putting the foot on the accelerator of this intimidation with the publication of advertisement ads in our free press".
"With the spread of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the accompanied American tradition of freedom of expression and press publishing a pay ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad said.
"In contrast, in the banks here in Beijing, we find very few dissident voices and we will never see a true reflection of the diversity of opinions that the Chinese might have of the worrying economic trajectory of their country, because the media are under firm control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
In addition, he added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not mention which.
Republicans alienate women's voters before the mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, warn analysts
At a time when many important Republicans support and defend the appointment of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various charges of sexual assault, analysts warn that this may lead to a negative reaction, particularly of women, during the short term elections.
The emotions surrounding the case have been very strong and the majority of the Republicans have already publicly stated that they intend to proceed to a vote.
These things have no backlog," said The Hill Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher stated that doubting that the last hour's pressure on Senator Jeff Flake (Republic of Arizona) to carry out an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm the elected rebels.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national spokesman for the Progressist Group MoveOn, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang "November is at the door!" when they appeared in the Senate court, since the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee chose to proceed with the appointment of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will beat all the memories," said the news site Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst without a party membership.
"People say it's already high; it's true.
But it can be even higher, particularly among the indecisive voters in the suburban areas and the younger voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a negative reaction could occur if the Republicans went ahead with confirmation.
"This has become a trap for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Republican Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote, or about whether Kavanaugh will take his place. It's also about how the Republicans dealt with the issue and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect democrats, to the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority aligning with the first.
A new survey by YouGov revealed that 41% of respondents believed absolutely or probably in Ford's testimony, while 35% said they believed absolutely or probably in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% claimed that Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied in his testimony, while only 30% claimed the same about Ford.
After Flake's proposal, the FBI initiated an investigation into Ford's allegations as well as another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford referred under oath to the Senate Judicial Committee last week that Kavanaugh had sexually harassed her while alcoholized, when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the appointment to the Supreme Court exposed its genital organs when the two attended a party during the period during which they both studied in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor intends to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, created a startup that aims to rival with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest design of this legendary character of technologies, Inrupt, is a company that takes part in Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
This allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to that information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee said in play that the intention underlying the Inrupt is to "dominating the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data storage", or POD.
This can contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in a single browser and simultaneously.
What is unique about the online personal data storage is that it belongs exclusively to the user to decide on who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal capacity through the data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the CEO of John Bruce, is to provide adequate resources, processes and competences to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some internal programmers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
At the beginning of this week, the world-wide technology makers will be able to create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee claimed that he and his team are not talking to the "Facebook and Google about the introduction or not of a total change in which all their business models are turned from the front of one day to the other.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a publication in the Media on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new Web created with Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even as the Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic with this next era of the Web," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Honor the clergy decorated with the Victoria Cross in the First Great War
The only clergy of the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross during the First Great War was honored in its 100-year-old city-natural.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann obtained the decoration on September 29, 1918 with the attack on Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a French-attractor four days later and never knew that he had received the highest British military honor.
His two grandchildren set off a memorial plate at a stop in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "bright symbolic" that the plate had been presented exactly 100 years after the fact that he gave the decoration to his grandfather.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Coronel Vann led his battalion through the Canal of Saint Quentin "a very thick fog and closed fire with portable and machine guns".
Then he ran to the fire line and, "with the greatest courage", led the line forward before attacking only one cannon and beating three soldiers from the standoff.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German freeman on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years of age, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know he'd never be equal, but also a lesson of humility".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a crown of flowers after the stop, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored for participating in the stand" and added that "the courage of a genuine hero is being demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people".
Fans of mixed martial arts all night long to see the Bellator 206 watch instead of the Porca Peppa
Imagine this: You are awake all night to see the Bellator 206, full of stars and, finally, you are prevented from seeing the main event.
The San José series included 13 matches, with six of the main groups, and was being shown live during the night in the UK, at Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, the spectators in the United Kingdom were frightened when the cover changed to the Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after they had been agreed to until early in the morning especially for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the change for animated designs for children as "a kind of bad taste joke".
"The regulation of the government says that the content is not suitable for the six in the morning, so they had to change for another programming," said Dave Schwartz, administrator with the hair of the marketing and communications when questioned about the transmission.
"Peppa's pig," yes.
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said that the same would correct the schedule of transmissions to include future UK viewers.
"I think that when I think about the repetition, I think we can solve the problem," said Coker.
"But there are six Sunday mornings there and we will not be able to solve it until our Sunday time, which is a second fair in British time.
But we're working on it.
I'm not lying when I say that, when the programming changed, there were many messages exchanged and none very nice.
We were trying to solve the problem, and we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't: it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We're going to reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we normally do.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low" about his sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that gave him motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize until he got into high school that "not everyone is like me."
In an interview with the first Desert Island Discs of Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was in favour of the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a father made him less concerned with winning the Olympic Games.
The program’s long-term regular presentation, Kirsty Young, took a series of months’ strike due to disease.
Appearing as a pair in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "lower" to everyone else because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
In his words, "to this day, this impression of feeling smaller and different has been the real reason that has given me the power and strength to achieve success."
His goal was to prove it was "someone," he said, not to disappoint everyone when they discovered their sexuality sooner or later.
The double Olympic bronze medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and used his participation in Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to appeal to more countries to describe homosexuality.
According to him, he manifested himself because he felt happy that he could live openly without consequences and intended to give "hope" to others.
The world trim champion said to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "I got caught by surprise".
Daley married Oscar's winner last year, 20 years older, although he said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When we go through so when we are so young" - its first participation in the Olympic Games was at 14 years of age and father died of cancer three years later - he said, it is hard to find someone of the same age who has passed through high and low levels.
The couple had a son last year in June, called Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all his perspective" had changed.
"If I had been asked last year, all that mattered was "to win a gold medal," he said.
There are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had the tickets for the London games in 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell you that "you won't be around to be in the first row," he said.
"He was holding his hand not when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and obtained a bronze medal.
"I was fully aware that it was what I had dreamed of the whole life: diving in front of a multitude of compatriots in the Olympics... there was no better feeling," he said.
All this was also the inspiration of his first choice of song - Proud, of Heather Small - with which he had identified himself during the preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives him chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs takes place on BBC Radio 4 at 11.15 a.m. on Sunday, British summer time.
Mickelson down in the bank at Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Saturday when he's on his 47th trip to a Ryder Cup, but he'll have to recover his way to prevent the frame from symbolizing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing at the biennial event for the 12th time, a record of participation, was sent to the bank by Captain Jim Furyk at the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the center of action, as often has been in the United States teams, the five-time winner of the main male championships divided the day between the role of a supporter and the work in his field game, hoping to correct what afflicts him.
Never given the most challenges even in the height of your career, the 48-year-old player is not ideal for the Le Golf National field, where the long rough usually punishes the wrong heels.
And if the field by itself was not sufficiently intimidating, Mickelson, on Sunday's 9th, will face the precise British Open Francesco Molinari champion, who teamed up with beginner Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four games they fought this week.
If Americans, with a four-point disadvantage to start the 12 single parts, register a good start, Mickelson's play can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but not that he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a palm on my back, placed his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a respected champion who gave these teams a lot of money in the past, as well as this week.
I probably hadn't seen him playing two games.
I thought more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we thought we would have to proceed.
He wants to be in the game, like everyone else."
Mickelson will cross Nick Faldo's record on Sunday of the biggest match at Ryder Cup.
This can mark the end of a career in Ryder Cup that has never equaled the successes of your individual career.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven empathies, although Furyk has stated that his presence has created some countless advantages for the team.
"He's sarcastic, funny and spiritual, he likes to play with people and he's an excellent person to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players have been having fun with him this week as well, which was fun to see.
It gives much more than just playing."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his great advantage can disappear in an apex
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that his leadership broke when entering the last day of singles at Ryder Cup can easily become an accident.
The Danish had its star in the 1997 game in Valderrama, where a team captained by Sve Ballesteros kept an advantage of five points on the Americans, but crossed the finish line with the nose with the narrowest of the margins, winning by 141 1⁄2-131 1⁄2.
"We always try to remember that we had a considerable advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but little by little," said Bjorn, in the picture, after attending the 2018 Turma victory for 5-3, both on Friday and yesterday, to lead for 10-5 in Le Golf National.
Thus, history has shown me and all those who are in this team that this has not yet ended.
Tomorrow, give your best.
Go over there and do everything right.
This doesn't end until we have the points in the marker.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophy and that is where the approach must remain.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are well aware of who is on the other side: the best players in the world."
Enthralled by the performance of their players in a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go ahead with myself in this.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What matters tomorrow is individual performance and this involves a different task.
It's great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when we're there on our own, our skills as golfers are tested to the maximum.
This is the message you need to convey to players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now they're going to leave the partner and he has to go and give the best of himself too."
In contrast with Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will try to make his players have a better performance individually than as partners, constituting the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points in four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of these great revolutions on the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up losing when Europe took out of the cartel the "Milagre in Medina".
"I remember all the words," he said in answer to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to get that fast start like what you saw in Brooklyn and what you saw in Medina.
When this impulse is directed towards one side, the pressure is very large in these parts of the middle.
We organized our actual in line and ordered the players the way we feel, you know, that we're going to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas, with the mission of trying to lead the counter-attack, faces Rory McIlroy in the main game, being Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players for this order because I think it covers the whole route," Bjorn said about his choices for the singles.
New German warship once again delayed
The most recent wreckage of the German Navy should have entered the service in 2014 to replace warships during the Cold War. However, it will be necessary to wait at least until next year, due to systems that are prone to accidents and a cost of exponential growth, according to local media.
The entrance to the service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the command ship of the newly broke Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was now delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper that quoted a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery have undermined the destiny of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the Navy had ordered in 2007 will serve to replace the broken old Bremen class.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, as well as a series of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-shipships, as well as some furtive technologies such as reducing radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenances, which would allow the most recent fractures to be sent to missions with a maximum duration of two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the late continuums have made that with the last-generation warships, considered as a form of Germany designing cross-border power, they will already be unattended when they enter service, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made stains last year when the German Navy refused to put it in service, having returned it to the shipyards of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
There is little knowledge about the reasons for the return, but the German media cite a series of crucial "hardware defects and software" that would make the warship useless if used in a combat mission.
The software deficits were particularly important, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the required quota in the oldest wreckage of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the marine capacity to install additional features in the future.
It is believed that the 'Rheinland-Pfalz' of 7,000 tonnes has the weight of similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the total project price, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that this will have reached a staggering EUR 3.1 billion, an increase compared to the initially budgeted 2.2 billion.
The problems facing the most recent fractures have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that German naval power is weakening.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, leader of the German parliamentary defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy is currently leaving ships capable of being used."
The policy stated that the problem had grown exponentially over time, as older ships had been out of service without ships being able to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg's fractures could have joined the Navy.
National Trust spys on the secret life of the bats
New investigations are being carried out in a property in the Scottish Highlands with the aim of revealing how bats use the landscape to look for food.
Results are expected to give some insight into the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common pieces and fruit, as well as long ears and Daubenton pieces in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations spread by the property to follow the activities of the mortars along the station.
Mobile studies will also be carried out by NTS personnel and volunteers with portable detectors.
The analysis by experts of all recordings will evaluate the frequency of the calls of the pieces and what each species is doing.
A map of the habitat will then be produced to create a detailed image of its behaviours on the territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, a consultant for the conservation of the nature of the NTS, hopes that the results reveal which areas of habitat are most important for the bites and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forests for bats and associated species.
The population of bites in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined considerably over the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect the bedrooms and make habitat scarce.
The wind turbines and the lamps are also a threat, together with the moss paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In fact, bites are not blind.
However, given your night hunting habits, your ears are more useful than your eyes when it comes to catching the prey.
It is used by them a sophisticated eco location technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the region, takes the pieces very seriously.
The organization has ten trained specialists who carry out regular studies, dormitories inspections and sometimes rescues.
It also created the first reservation in Scotland dedicated exclusively to the bites, in the property Thrave in Dumfries and Galloway, which hosts eight of the ten species of Scottish bites.
The property manager, David Thompson, says the same is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Thrave we have an excellent area for bites," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and all this good habitat.
However, there is still much about the pieces we don't know, so the work we're doing here and in other properties will help us know more about what they need to flourish."
It stressed the importance of checking whether there are pieces before maintaining the properties, as the non-intended destruction of only one maternity dorm may lead to the death of up to 400 young women and animals, which could eradicate the whole of the local population.
The bites are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, to sit them, to disturb them or to destroy their bedrooms.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish Conservation Trust's head, encouraged the public to participate to help.
It was said by her: "We still have much to learn about our bites, and for many of our species, we simply don't know how their populations are vending."
Ronaldo desperately charges of rape when his lawyers prepare to process German newspaper
Christian Ronaldo characterized the allegations of rape against him as "false news", claiming that people "want to promote themselves" using their name.
Your lawyers are preparing to process the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The advanced Portuguese and Juventus selection was accused of violating an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that then you will have $375 000 to keep the alleged victim silent on the accident, read in Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking in a live video in Instagram at its 142 million followers hours after disclosure of the allegations, Ronaldo, aged 33, characterized the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," he said to the chamber the winner of five Gold Balls.
"They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the profession.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to process Der Spiegel on the allegations, which have characterized as "an unacceptable report of suspicion in the field of privacy", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would require compensation for moral damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident will take place in June 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After being found in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga will have reportedly gone to the player's room, where he will have violated it annually, according to the documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo lay down his knees after the alleged incident and told him that it was "99%" "a good guy", damaged by "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual relations, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photos of her injuries taken in a hospital, but that she would later agree to enter into an extrajudicial agreement because she felt "attended by the prospect of retaliation" and was concerned about the possibility of "being humiliated publicly".
At 34 years of age, the woman now claims that she intends to cancel the agreement, as she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join the Royal Madrid, leaving Manchester United at the time of the alleged aggression. This summer he moved to the Italian giants Juve in a 100 million-euro business.
Brexit: United Kingdom "repent for ever" to lose car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "would regret it forever" if it lost its world leader status in the car factory after Brexit, said the Secretary for Greg Clark Companies.
Clark also mentioned that Toyota in the United Kingdom had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop production of its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of delays on borders in the case of a Brexit without agreement could lead to job loss.
The factory in Burnston, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My perspective is that if Britain unravelly leaves the EU at the end of March, we will attend the production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom expressed concerns about the EU's exit without agreement on the level of operation of cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said that it would close its Minis factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers claim to be the risks of the supply chain in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is managed on a "just-in-time" basis, with the pieces reaching every 37 minutes, from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU, for vehicles manufactured by order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, disturbances may occur at the border, which the sector says can lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of stocks in its Derbyshire factory, the company said, so production would have to stop.
Clark said Theresa May's "Checkers Plan" for future relations with the EU was "calibrated precisely to avoid these border checks".
"We have to have an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that allows, as I said, not only the current success, but also the use by us of this opportunity," said the BBC's Today Radio 4 programme.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers points out that we absolutely need to be able to continue with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains."
Although it has not been able to provide an estimate of the stop time, Toyota said that in the long term, the increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and could lead to the loss of jobs sooner or later.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at Burnaston's factory for 24 years and coordinates the United Union union in this place, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never return again.
A government spokesman said that "we have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "adjourned another week" since there is still no understanding of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, referred to the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump's advisers and Russia and the possible obstruction of justice by the President.
The fact that Trump could be preparing the resignation of the Deputy Attorney General, thus putting Mueller's independence at risk, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of discontinuing talks with Trump and the possibility of deposing the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But on Monday he moved to the White House, having information that he would be ready to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was in the United Nations, New York.
Trump said that "I would rather not say goodbye" Rosenstein, but the meeting was then delayed to avoid the overlap with a hearing by the Senate Justice Commission in which they testified to Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation with a week's duration on the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the final vote in the Senate.
Trump's press advisor, Sarah Sanders, participated in Fox News Sunday.
Questioned about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been marked, it may be this week, but it may also be delayed for another week, given all that has happened in the Supreme Court.
Let's see, I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists did not agree with this statement: Sanders has not organized a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences is not due to a "protagonism" of television reporters, although he said that: "Do not disagree with the fact that they like the protagonist."
He then realized that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President makes more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, adding, without adding evidence: "We have analyzed these numbers."
The press conferences will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has an opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that is infinitely better than to talk to me.
We have often tried to do this and have seen that we have done so in recent weeks, and the fact that they can talk to the President of the United States replaces any press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences, when receiving foreign representatives.
Press conferences on the ground are rare.
This week the President showed why in New York, appearing in a relaxed and sometimes bizarre way in front of the journalists present.
Minister of Health writes to EU workers in the Scottish National Health Service about Brexit's fears
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and request that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months after leaving the EU Kingdom.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to paying applications for the status of EU citizens working in the decentralized public services of the country.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "In the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, and decisions were expected for this autumn.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible escape scenario without agreement.
I know this is a very worrying time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reaffirm at this moment how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of his nationality.
The colleagues from all over the EU and other sources bring valuable experiences and competences, which strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we want you to continue here."
Christion Abercrombie submitted to emergency surgery after having had head injuries
The Tennessee State Tigers defense, Christian Abercrombie, was submitted to an emergency surgery after having had head injuries on Saturday for 31-27 in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ reported on the Tigers.
Tennessee's coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the interval.
"She approached the sideline and almost fainted," Reed reported.
The technical team and medical personnel put Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before sleeping in a cat and transporting it to a deeper assessment.
A team representative told Chris Harris of the Nashville WSMV, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type/gravity of the injury" and that the team is trying to find out when this happened.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, suspended the studies during the first season with Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He made five posters on Saturday before leaving the game, raising his entire season to 18 posters.
A higher seal tax will be charged to foreign buyers when acquiring properties in the United Kingdom
The Conservative Party announced plans to charge a higher seal tax to foreign buyers who acquired properties in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to be invested in aid to non-residents
The measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract the youngest electorate
The increase in seal tax will affect buyers who are not taxed in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
A higher stamp tax will be charged to foreign buyers who have acquired properties in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to be invested in aid to homeless people, today Theresa May will announce.
The measure is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's campaign's success to attract the youngest electorate, with promises to provide more affordable accommodation and to tax the highest income.
The increase in seal tax will affect people and businesses who are not taxed in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to boost the government's campaign to offer a roof to homeless people.
The surplus - added to the current seal tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second rooms and purchases for rent - may rise to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects that the measure will allow up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13% of the new buildings in London are acquired by non-residents in the United Kingdom, making prices rise and making it difficult to access first-room buyers to the market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "phantom cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers that spend most of the time away from the country.
The new policy emerges weeks after Boris Johnson has demanded a cut of the seal tax to help young people acquire their first residence.
He accused the large construction companies of keeping the prices of the high properties when landing land that they do not use, demanding that Ms. May leave the quotas on the premises available to resolve the "damage of accommodation" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced an appealing set of housing reform proposals, including income controls and the end of the "no justification".
He also wants to assign extended powers to the municipalities for the construction of new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for every new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not true that it is so easy to buy a house for people living outside the United Kingdom and for foreign companies as for British workers living in the United Kingdom.
For too many people the dream of being the owner of their home has become too distant and the shame of those who sleep over the delay continues to be too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to guide Scotland"
Sunderland Coach Jack Ross said his "last ambition" was coming to become Scotland's picker.
The 42-year-old Scotch has been successful in the challenge of giving a new life to the North-East club, currently ranked third in the First League, to three points of leadership.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St. Mirren on his return to the Scottish First Division in the past.
"You want to represent my country as a player.
But I just got an internationalization B," Ross told the BBC Scotland Sports Sound program.
"I grew to see Scotland playing in Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But this opportunity will only arise if you succeed in managing clubs."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says he didn't feel afraid to happen to names so consecrated in a club of such a large size, after rejecting invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, at the moment the success is summarized as "can I take the club back to the Premier League?"
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, its place is undoubtedly in the Premier League," he said.
"It won't be easy to take the club back, but I'll just think I've been successful here when I reach that goal."
Ross's career as a coach is only three years old, after a period as an assistant coach of Dumbarton and 15 months on the hearts technical team.
He then helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and led St. Mirren from the threat of depromotion to the title of champion in the following time.
Ross reports that he feels more comfortable now than he once felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Taking into account the Alloa "was a true crusade", he recalls.
"I've always seen myself more in the coach's role than in the player's role.
It seems strange because it went well, I won life as a player and I had some high moments in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face many challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of stress and load pressures, but I feel very good as a trainer.
I always wanted to train, and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I once felt during my adult life."

The perfect time for a painting is 17:30 on Saturday, according to a study
The heat wave of the summer filled the British pubs, but put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Restoration groups recorded a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but the occupation of the restaurants declined 4.8%, showing the statistics.
Peter Martin, from CGA consultant, who compiled the statistics, said: "The continuation of good time and England's career in the Football World Championship, longer than expected, made the pattern of June, in which the pubs recorded a growth of 2.8% in sales, would be repeated in July, but the restaurants met a reunion.
The fall of 1.8% recorded in the sales of the restaurant in June was worse in July.
Pubs and bars with the business absent in the drinks had the best performance far away, with a homologous growth more than they compensated the downfall of the restaurants.
Pubs with business absent in the meals also experienced difficulties, although not as dramatic as those of the restoration operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars run directly, the sales of drinks rose 6.6% during the month, with meals returning 3%."
Paul Newman, from the analyst of the laser and RSM restoration sectors, said: "These results extend the trend we have recorded since the end of April.
Meteorology and the impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors that influence the sales of the food market outside the home.
It is not surprising that the restoration groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual decrease in sales of 4.8% is particularly harmful when combined with the extension of the cost pressure.
The long and hot summer could not reach the worst time for operators with business absent in the meals. Only time will tell if the warmest temperatures we know in August will provide such relief."
The growth of the total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the brand launch threshold.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the sectoral indicator of sales of British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes the performance data of 47 operating groups, with a combined business volume of over 9 billion pounds, being recognized as the sector's benchmark.
One in every five children hidden from their parents secret accounts on social networks
One in every five children - some with only 11 years of age - has secret accounts on social networks that hide from parents and teachers, revealed a study
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in "false" pages in Instagram
The news exacerbates fears about publication of content of a sexual nature
Twenty percent of students claimed to have a "main" account to show their parents
One in every five children - some with only 11 years of age - creates accounts on the social networks that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid increase in "false" accounts on the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news exacerbates fears about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students claimed to have an innocent "principal" account to show their parents, having private accounts at the same time.
A mother who found the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter discovered that the teenager was urging others to "violate her."
The study, conducted by the UK Digital Awareness and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools, revealed that 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, half of which he admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Elid Doyle was elected Non-Executive Director of the Scottish Council of Athletics at the Annual General Assembly of the Regulator.
Doyle is the most successful Scottish athletes. President Ian Beattie described the nomination as an excellent opportunity for sports regulators to take advantage of their vast international experience over the past decade.
"Eilid is extremely respected throughout the Scottish, British and global community of athleticism and we are sure that Scottish athleticism will have much to gain with its presence in the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to be able to act like the voice of athletes and I hope to be able to contribute really to helping guide sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-400-metre test in the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular commentator at the BBC, stopped walking after a transient ischemic accident.
As he wrote on Twitter: "Do today a month that suffers from a stroke.
I stopped walking.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I could recover and to what extent.
It's been a painful job, but it's got a total recovery, it's getting back to walking, and I've even been doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising milk extraction pump compares mothers to cows, dividing opinions online
A milk extraction company divided online opinions with an ad comparing mothers who breast-feed cows in order.
To mark the launch of what is described as the "first silent portable milk extraction pump", the consumer technology company Elvie launched an ironic announcement inspired in music videos to highlight the freedom granted by the new milk pump to mothers who extract milk.
Four mothers dance in a pheno-filled holiday to the sound of a music that includes verses like, "Yes, I'm ordering, but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't repaired, I don't have tits, these are my breasts."
The refroner goes on to say, "Bombie, bombie, baby food, bombie, bombie, I'm ordering my kids."
However, the ad published on the company's Facebook page generated online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from the viewers, with many saying it would lighten the "horrors" of the Latino sector.
"You tried to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only their babies are stolen to them a few days after they were born," wrote one viewer.
The Elvie extraction pump is discreetly contained within a breast-feeding unit (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Comprehensively traumatic to mother and baby.
But why don't you use them to announce an extraction bomb for mothers who can stay with their babies?"
Someone said, "An announcement with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the ad, like a woman who admitted to finding the song "hilarian".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a crazy little bit, but it makes all sense.
This product is great," wrote one of the women.
Another commented: "It is a fun announcement addressed to mothers who extract milk (many times in bathrooms or in the workplace) and feel like "vacs".
It's not an announcement to praise or judge the Latino sector."
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they were dancing with the discreet bombs housed in the Sutians.
The concept behind the campaign is based on information that many women who extract milk with bombs claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie bomb is completely silent, it has no wires or tubes and it is discreetly inside a breast support, giving women the freedom to move, grab their babies and even leave home while they extract milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Director of "Mother", commented: "The Elvie bomb is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative release.
By establishing a parallel between women who extract milk and milk cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction, while we presented in a fun way and with which people can identify the incredible feeling of freedom provided by the new bomb.
It wasn't the first time the Elvie bomb was hit.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared in the passerelle for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children discreetly relocated to a camp at the border of Texas
The number of migrant children detained reached a peak, despite the monthly crossings of the border remained relatively unchanged, in part because severe rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump administration made it difficult for children to be fed up.
Traditionally, most of the "fathers" are themselves undocumented immigrants, fearing to compromise their own ability to stay in the country by offering to raise a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential employers and other adults who integrate their family aggregates would have to record their fingerprints and shared data with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Albanian Immigration and Control Service, testified to the Congress that the service has tens of people who have applied for minors who have not been accompanied.
The service subsequently confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
"Approximately 80% of the standard or members of the respective family aggregates are illegal in the country, many of them being aliens with criminal records.
That is why we will continue to pursue these individuals," Mr Albence said.
In an attempt to speed up the processing of children, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of the date of detention, instead of 60 days, the previous rule, according to the officials of the reception centres.
Many are present by videoconference, not in person, to defend their application for legal status before a judge of the immigration court.
Those considered to be eligible for aid shall be promptly deported.
The longer children remain detained, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to access to violence or attempts to escape, according to the staff of the reception centres and reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights defenders say that these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities such as those of Tornillo, where the large dimension contributes to the neglect of children.
They add that the transfer of children to camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends aggravates the trauma with which many are already arguing.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal from the US, French and Turkish "occupational forces"
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem also requested the return of Syrian refugees to the home, despite the war in the country in his eighth year.
Mouleem, who is also Vice-Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of the fight against terrorism, and that "will be treated as such".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the Assembly.
Moulem insisted that the "war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that left millions of displaced people still.
He said Damascus would continue to "break this sacred battle until we free all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "all and any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and advising the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this country devastated by war.
With regard to the refugee issue, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were assured, accusing "some Western countries" of "spare irrational fears" that led refugees to stay abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to put an end to the war.
UN diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security zone in the last great rebel base of Idlib created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement avoided a large-scale attack of the Syrian forces supported by the Russians in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement established "clear spaces" and expressed hope that the military action aimed at the jihadists, including the fighters of the Al-Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, would "be eradicated".
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene shortly the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, preparing the ground for elections.
Moualem laid down conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the panel should be limited to "revision of the articles of the current constitution" and warning against possible interference.
Because Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers are likely to expect, the challenge and scandals will soon end their presidency.
In the one that would no doubt constitute "the most dramatic end of a presidency forever"!
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue from the spectators.
Since 2014, the senior hearings have more than doubled to 1.05 million in the CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in the MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million spectators in good time, a rise of 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" by MSNBC led the cable hearings with up to 3.5 million spectators on the big news nights.
"This is a strong call for people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, a producer of ABC's "Designed Survivor" program on a cabinet chief who becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
In the Scovell, a veteran eater and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
Remember when you called a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told him he was going to vote Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
Chaos has value of entertainment.
Of course, contrary to television programmes, the stories from Washington will determine the future of legislation on abortion, the right to family meetings of immigrants and the health of the global economy.
Changing the program is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can give.
And yet this is more than being an informed citizen when we are attending a six-hour debate by experts on the use by Bob Woodward of sources "with deep knowledge" in his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's leather blouse of 15,000 dollars ("a piece of clothing full of insolence", as Washington Post said) and the implications of stormy Daniels'... um... President Trump's anatomy.
For my part, I'll never face Super Mario the same way.
"Part of what he's done seems to be a reality show because he gives us something every night," said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", on Trump's dynamic list and the daily revolvings of the circle (antigonizing with the NFL, praise Kim Jong-Un).
We can't lose any episode or stay back.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week they were 26 on the northern coast of Kaui, but he was closed at home, seeing MSNBC while recording CNN.
He did not detract from television while Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to witness to the Senate Justice Commission, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I still remember when we did all those crazy programs and people said: this is the principle of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but at last they were right."

Significant external funding in the inter-hour elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th Century of Pennsylvania is aware of a flow of funding, thanks to a realisation of the electoral circles that left two holders in the race for the same place.
The recent adjustment of Pittsburgh's suburban circles put the Democratic Conor Lamb in the race, which won its place in another circle in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb is running against another holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th circle of Pennsylvania, which is largely superior to the new 17th circle.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the former circles would unconstitutionally favor the Republicans.
The race for the 17th round triggered a difficult dispute over the funding of the campaign between the main parties' financial arms, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangential victory in the extremely controversial extraordinary March elections for the 18th electoral circle of the Congress of Pennsylvania.
This place was occupied more than a decade ago by a Republican and President Donald Trump won 20 percentage points in the circle.
Analysts have given the democrats a slight advantage.
USA thought to penalize El Salvador for supporting China, then retreating
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with few protests in Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled Trump Organization from the management.
Representatives of the Department of State decided to call the leaders of the US diplomatic representations in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after the "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the Department of State, in a statement this month.
But only sanctions against El Salvador were considered, which received approximately US$ 140 million in 2017, including for control of drug trafficking, economic aid and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial assistance and specific visa restrictions, would have severely penalized this Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
With the continuation of the internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America held a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, the top officials of the Administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, taking all due account of the sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has scheduled an intervention at the conference, now marked for mid-October, in a sign of the importance given by the administration to the meeting, the diplomats said.
The three American representatives discreetly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any hard messages or punishments from Washington.
The spokesman for the White House for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal deliberations to the coverage of the anonymity.
His reports were corroborated by an external analyst near the Administration, who also requested the anonymity.
Study the History
The next bomb to be released may be the report by legal adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, on which there are currently substantial evidence in the public sector.
Mueller will be allegedly guiding his investigation in order to find out if Trump's campaign has conspired with Russia in order to attack the elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face responsibility on the part of that body, at the same time preparing to present himself again to the electors and perhaps to be judged by their parents.
These are many hypotheses and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - not the one of his equivalents in Europe.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, some German officials were ready to deposit Hitler in a coup d'état, provided the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We talked and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnival that followed.
The course of history revolves around points of inflection such as this, in which the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or slowed down.
The Americans are currently facing several of these inflection points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been threatened since this paper reported that last year he suggested to record the President secretly, speculating on his inability to perform the task.
Rosenstein says The Times news is wrong.
"How will we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court, despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and dishonest witnesses?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress responsible for Mr Trump?
If we sink into these tests, democracy will be about to go through a long desert.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that in time occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to burn Sabbath candles on that table with swath.
With a legacy of these, how could he not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Optimist Rangers before the game with the Rapid of Vienna
The Rangers receive the Rapid of Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following the impressive match in Spain with the Villareal at the beginning of the month, will leave them in a good position to qualify in Group G of the League of Europe.
An injury in the knee prevented average Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the time until the tie to two goals with the Villareal, but he believes the Rangers will be able to use this result as a trampoline for higher flights.
"It was a good point for us because Villareal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We found the game with a positive mentality and we won a point.
Perhaps we could have won near the end, but in global terms, the empathate was probably the fairest result.
They were probably better in the first part, but we turned around and dominated in the second part.
Thursday will be another great European night.
I hope we can win the three points. It will be a difficult game because they have achieved a good result in the last game, but with the support of the public, I am sure we will do our best to achieve a positive result.
Last year was very hard, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good environment.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the training runs well.
I hope we can give our best, forget the past and achieve success."
Women are losing sleep with fear of this rescue-reform account
Despite the fact that participants in the investigation have a clear idea of the type of care they intend to take, few people spoke to their families about the matter.
About half of the individuals questioned in the nationwide study referred to the respective spouses about the cost of continued care.
Only 10% mentioned talking to the children about the same subject.
"People want a family to take care of themselves, but they're not having this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of the National Life Insurance Branch.
That's how it starts.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You will not be able to prepare your family to take care of them if you do not give them a chance to know their wishes in the right way.
Work with your consultant and your family, discussing where and how to receive care, since these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
It involves your financial consultant: your consultant may also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Their continuing care financing choices may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid policy with monetary value to help cover these costs or funding using their own savings, provided that they have these available values.
Prepare legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Name a health care prosecutor, choosing a person of your trust to monitor your health care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes in case you are prevented from communicating with them.
Consider the establishment of a commission on your finances.
You will have to select someone you trust to make the financial decisions by yourself, ensuring that your accounts will be paid if you are unable to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent suffers from a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you like to answer the questions about medication and allergies?

Who'll take care of the dog?
Prepare this plan."
Targeted man multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was targeted several times with an air pressure when he returned home after a night in the city.
The victim, at the house of the forty years old, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when it was reached in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The agents described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries do not involve life risk and the police have requested witnesses.
Systems and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities reported, hoping that the number of deaths could increase.
With the interrupted communications, the relief workers were unable to obtain any information from the Dongala region, a zone north of Palu which is closer to the epicenter of magnitude 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dongala is a region that extends over 300 km from the coast, north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with an administrative status lower than that of a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the province of Sulawesi Central, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
The extraction of nickel is also important in the province, but mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the last hundred years, according to the Indonesian disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Sismic Fire Ring, being regularly hit by Sismos.
Here are some of the main sixsomes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, in the north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong sixsomes reached the western coast of Sumatra, at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, along Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, resulting in a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit one of Mentawai islands along Sumatra, disposing of a tsunami with waves up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A little deep earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, spreading destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastating earthquake and tsunamis of 2004.
This time no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died buried under the ruins of the buildings.
2018: Great Sismos hit the Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The Sismos destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Older son of Sarah Palin arrested for allegations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for charges of aggression.
Palin, a 29-year-old resident in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, interference in an investigation into domestic violence and detention resistance, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaska police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he pulled his phone.
Palin was previously detained in the Mat-Su pre-trial detention centre, subject to a $500 loan, notified KTUU.
He was present to the judge on Saturday, declaring himself "openly, innocent", announced the station.
Palin faces charges for three Class A crimes, which means he can be sentenced to a fine of up to a year and fined at $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B crime, punishable with a day of chains and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges against Palin are brought.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is being brought before the Alaska Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interference in the complaint of a domestic violence crime and possession of alcohol-based weapons in relation to the incident.
Your girlfriend accused him of squeezing in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised in 2016 by veteran associations after associating the child's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress due to his service in Iraq.
Sism and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died following a earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.

Public Ministry requests rare capital punishment for suspected terrorist attack in New York
The New York Public Ministry seeks the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city - a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is accused of using a truck rented by Home Depot to carry out an attack in October, a cycle in West Side Highway, in the Manhattan Basilica, finding pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intendedly" killed the eight victims and "intendedly" inflicted serious injuries, according to the notification requesting the death penalty, registered in the South of New York.
Both charges can be punished with the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, the jury of a federal court accused Saipov of 22 crimes, including eight charges of murder to the service of organized crime, normally used by the Public Ministry in cases of organised crime, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "considerable planning and premeditation", the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed it as "atrocious, cruel and devious".
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the notification refers.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For a decade the South Zone of New York didn't demand the death penalty for an accusation.
The reu, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but the penalty was commuted to permanent prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced by conspiracy to commit espionage to the Soviet Union, two years earlier, during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the court's documentation, Saipov, natural of Uzbekistan, has not shown any delays in the days and months that followed the attack.
He told the researchers he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired to carry out the attack after seeing videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the charge.
He also applied for permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, referred to the police.
It was declared innocent in relation to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's defense lawyers, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution decision.
"We think that the decision to ask for the death penalty rather than accept a confession of guilt for eternal imprisonment, without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Conservative Member states that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the popular army" during a protest at the Conservatory Congress.
The former UKIP leader said politicians were supposed to feel the pressure of Eurocetics, while one of Theresa May's members suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservator Peter Bone said in Birmingham's demonstration that the United Kingdom would "have gone out" if Farage was the minister of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May to reconcile her deeply divided correlationaries was emphasized by the conservatives who advocated permanence, who organized a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister has been debating to maintain his commitment plan, known as the Chequers Plan, in the face of attacks by Brexit, the supporters of residence and the EU.
The allies insist that she will continue to try to reach agreement with Brussels despite the protests, forcing the Euro-Cetitics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and the 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone said in the beginning of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he intended to "end the Plan".
Bone suggested that Farage should have been given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we'd have gone out," he said.
Wellingborough said, "I will continue to defend Brexit, but we should end the Plan."
Reinforced its opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in two World Wars to be subordinate.
We want to make the laws of our own country."
Bone rejected the allegations that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their ideas and intends to stay is completely obscured".
Brexit Conservative Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the event, saying to journalists: "I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular to the public, the opposition will not approve it, is unpopular to our own party and to the militants who take the campaigns to the street and to whom we owe our election.
Let the Chequers Plan fall and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: "Only the prime ministers who know how to keep the promises keep their jobs."
Farage said in the demonstration that politicians should "sympathize with pressure" if they hurry to betray the decision that came out of the 2016 referendum.
"This has become a matter of trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them they're not going to get rid of it."
Turning to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want them to pressure our political class, which is at the edge of betraying Brexit.
We want to mobilize the popular army of this country that has given us the victory in Brexit and that will not rest until we become an independent, proud and self-ruled UK."
Meanwhile, the defenders of residence marched in Birmingham before organizing a two-hour start in the city center.
A crowd of activists pushed bands with the message "Conservators against Brexit" after the group was released this weekend.
The representative of the Labourists in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security problems they faced with an application of the party at the opening of the congress.
"It is these people who tell us that they will have computer systems and all technology prepared for "Canada more", for the border without friction, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit," he concluded.
Warren planned to "take seriously" the possible candidacy of the President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says he will "put the presidential candidate seriously" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a usual critic of President Donald Trump, is candidates for the re-election in November against Republican Member Geoff Diehl, co-mandate of the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that it will be able to face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters in the form of debate since Trump took possession.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to apply to the Presidency.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to correct the problems of our government, and that includes a woman at the top.
Detention in the context of the murder of Wayde Sims of LSU Tigers
Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the case of the LSU Tigers basketball player murder, Wayde Sims, Friday.
Baton Rouge Police announced the 20-year-old Detention of Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
The police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the images.
Yes, 20 years old, it was slaughtered near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims took a shot in the head, after which he ended up dying," the police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde defended a friend and was targeted by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to his presence at the site, imposing a weapon, recognizing having targeted Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without presenting resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish police team.

Russian Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title with a victory over Sebastian Vettel following team orders
It became clear from the time Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that team orders in Mercedes played a central role in the race.
Leaving the pole position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind defending his position on the first two curves, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first to the boxes and made Hamilton have to face the traffic of the end of the platoon, which could have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the boxes one time later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton crossed it after a renegade scarf, after which the Ferrari pilot retally left the inside of the free track, at risk of dequalification after a double trajectory correction to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was in the seventh place at the end of the first time, on the day of his 21st anniversary.
He then led a large part of the race, changing tires too late, which would allow him to be fast in the final part, aiming to cross Kimi Raikkonen to finish in fourth place.
He finished coming to the boxes in the 44th round but failed to improve his pace in the last eight rounds, which allowed Raikkonen to finish in the room.
"It's a hard day because Valteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real knight, letting me overrun him.
The team did an exceptional job, which allowed us to finish in the first two positions," Hamilton said.
Third Body Language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday because of his insistence that he would not have revealed a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
Speaking in a committee in West Virginia, the President did not refer directly to Ford's testimony before the Senate Justice Commission, commenting instead on what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "more, more malicious and false".
"See the beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate in the last days, see the wrath, see how people are more, evil and false," Trump said.
"When we see the leaks of information and communications and when they say 'oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, running away from you?
Do you remember the answer to her... did you disclose the document?
Oh, no.
The escape didn't leave me.'
Well, wait there.
The escape departed from us... no, it wasn't us," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with the details of the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the escape took place at the beginning of September, but denied that the escape had left his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the Commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked me for confidentiality, and I complied with her request."
But his disillusionment did not convince the President, who commented during the beginning of Saturday night: "You know that more, that was a bad body language.
Maybe it wasn't her, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In continuing to defend the nomination for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats would be using the charges in his favor.
"They are determined to regain power by resorting to all means.
We see wickedness, evil, no interest in who can reach, who have to walk to seize power and control," the President said, according to the Mediaite.

Aerial controller dies to help hundreds of passengers escape from seismic
An Indonesian air controller has been hailed as a hero after dying to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers is landing safely.
More than 800 people died and many are still missing after a strong earthquake had hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Powerful replicas continue to isolate the region, leaving many residents buried in the ruins in the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that his colleagues had fled to save themselves, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his seat while the control tower was violence at the airport of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri in Palu.
It was kept focused to ensure that Batik Air's 6321 flight, which was then on the track, landed safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower, in front of the imminent collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
The Indonesian air navigation agency spokesperson Yohannes Sirat said the decision could save hundreds of lives, announced the Australian TV chain ABC News.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to evacuate him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"We were devastated with this news," he added.
However, the authorities feared that the number of deaths could reach thousands, referring to the country's disaster management agency that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance sheet is increasing, since there are many bodies buried by the debris that we have not yet been able to rescue," said the spokesperson of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to six meters devastated Palu, where a collective funeral takes place on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are transporting aid and maintenance to the site.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute ambulances come with bodies.
There's no drinking water.
The minimers are being robbed all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, responsible for the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross Indonesia is in a race against time to help survivors, but we do not know what we will find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could be much worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday. According to CNN sources, he addressed the local military forces and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete the evacuation operations. Are they ready?"
At the beginning of this year, the island of Lombok in Indonesia was hit by the earthquake that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now reports that there is a man missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
The air carrier responsible for the plane that was deployed in a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, now reports that there is a missing man after reporting that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely rescued from the plane to sink.
In a statement, Air Niguini claimed that, from Saturday to Saturday afternoon, he could not confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger.
The area company has claimed to be collaborating with hospitals, researchers and local authorities to locate man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local vessels helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane had spent themselves in the water trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline advanced that six passengers remained hospitalized on Saturday, all of them with a stable clinical picture.
We still do not know for sure what was the cause of the fall or the exact sequence of events.
The U.S. airline and Navy were unanimous in stating that the plane failed to reach the track and amarried in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane had left the track.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane came very low.
"It was the best thing that happened," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and other people had managed to drag themselves with the water through the belt and get to the emergency exits of the plane to sink.
He told me that the boat attendants had panicked and started shouting, and that he had suffered a small head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, the mariners who were working on a mill improvement work in the vicinity also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable ship to transport people to the ground before the plane sinking at 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Based on data collected by Aviation Safety Network, in the last two decades 111 people died in accidents with registered PNG airlines, but none involved Air Niguini.
Analyst explains the chronology of the night events in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its allegations on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman living in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlet, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, witnessed for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the phone records to reconstruct the movements of 20-year-old Quintom Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of her death.
According to the newspaper Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several phones that confirm that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting the statements he had made earlier.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he had not been to the city that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in his car that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the car was in Nashville."
Another incongruity in Tellis' testimony pointed to the fact that he had claimed that he knew Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
The phone records indicated that they only met a week ago.
Rowlett said that, some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis turned off SMS messages, phone calls and contact information from Chambers.
"You paid her for her life," Hale said.
The defence should start presenting its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped that the trial would begin to be analyzed by the jury at the end of that day.

Another black?
Love New York couple process for dismissal through a "racist" SMS message
A New York lady is processing a marriage for discriminatory dismissal after having received a mother's text message deceitfully complaining that "it was more a black."
The couple denied the accusations of racism, claiming that the process was an act of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed some fear when she discovered that the new mother of Giselle Maurice was black when she presented herself for her first day of work in 2016.
"NO POSSO CRER... NO MORE PRETA," Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in an SMS message.
However, instead of sending the message to his husband, he sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when he realized about his gaffe, a Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice claiming the wrong performance of his former African-American lover and was waiting for a Filipino lover.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her only day of work and sent to Uber's house.
Now, Giselle Maurice is processing the couple and asking for a compensation of 350 USD/day for the period of six months for which she had been chosen without contract.
"I want to show them that they can't be punished," he said to Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination."
The couple rejected the allegations of racism, saying that rejecting Giselle was perfectly logical because they were afraid they could not trust her after being offended.
"My wife sent you something that I really didn't want to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racist people," Joel Plasco said to Post.
"Would your children trust someone who had treated you badly?
Your newborn son?
I don't believe it."
By appealing to the process of "extortion", Plasco said his wife had been a mother only two months ago and had to deal with "a very difficult situation."
"Will they pursue someone like that?
It's not very nice," the investment bank added.
While the legal process was taking place, the court of public opinion was censured by condemning the couple on social networks, criticizing their behaviour and reasoning.
New letter reveals that the editors of Paddington were afraid that readers could not identify themselves with a speaking bear.
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book had been accepted, commented the letter: "It's hard to get into someone's skin who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun to know this now, after Paddington's been so successful."
He commented that his father, who worked as a BBC camera operator before being inspired by a little bear to play the children's book, would not have borne the chest if the book had been rejected, and added that the 60-year-old anniversary of the publication had a bitter taste for its death last year.
About Paddington, who described as "a very important member of our family," said the father was very proud of the success achieved.
"He was a modest man, not a person given to gabarolice," he said.
"But as Paddington was so real to him, it was as if he had a successful son: we were proud even when the fact is not ours.
I think that's how I saw Paddington's success.
Despite being the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to my phone.
Soon after landing, the girl had been taken from the emergency to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"No one used to call to say that the situation was really bad and that there was no chance of survival," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
He said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
Soon we'll be together.
Together.
The medications that the doctors had given you to keep the heart working were slowly giving up and getting out of your system.
He had died a while ago, and all his organs were stopping.
I had to stay there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or complain because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to count."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers who were facing the test.
"No one knew," he said.
"I've always got my head down.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a tremendous compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women of mourning put cards in a bridge to avoid suicides
Two women who lost loved ones who committed suicide struggle to prevent others from following the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have placed cards on a galley bridge with motivation messages and phone numbers that people can use to get support.
Tyler, the son of Sharon Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want no father to feel what I feel every day," he said.
Sharon Davis, 45-year-old resident in Lydney, said that the son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said he was lighting the room."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he had "stolen in the darkness".
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always worried about a possible impact."
Sharon Davis created the posters "to know that there are people who are available to help and who can talk to, not to be a friend.
You don't have to talk to each other.
Kelly Humphreys, a long-term friend of Sharon Davis, lost Mark, his 15-year-old partner, shortly after his mother-in-law's death.
"I didn't say I was sad or depressed," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in her behavior.
On Christmas day, it was a trap. When the kids opened the presents, they didn't even look at them."
He said his death traumatized them a lot, but it's something they have to go through: "Destroy a family.
Nobody's indifferent.
But we all have to keep on living and fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake with the start of FBI investigation
"I thought that in terms similar to what I was asking - a research with defined time and scope - we could be more united," Jeff Flake said on Saturday, fearing that the committee would be "demorning" against a rooted party impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Its repulsion is just a matter of time.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away. On 6 November, if the Republicans are expected to have bad results, they will see their attempts to elect their candidate to the frustrated Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has contacted the senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met Ashley, the personal secretary of Bush at that time.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not true that Kavanaugh is able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pance to cast the vote of resignation and confirm his seat in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean deserters decrease during Kim's regime
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean deserters for North Korea has decreased since rising to the power of Kim Jong-one seven years ago.
Byeong-seug Park indicated that 1127 deserts occurred last year compared to 2706 of 2011.
Park said that the more stringent border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that smugglers of people were asking for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang didn't make any public statements.
General rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of the North Korean deserters.
Seoul revealed that more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strongly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers the deserters to be illegal and non-refugeeed migrants, and it is frequent to repatriate them.
The relations between North Korea and South Korea (technically still in war) have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearization negotiations that are in an impasse.
The talks took place after the historic meeting in June between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in general, to collaborate in the creation of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, it is impossible for us to take the first steps towards unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve at the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, a minority leader in the Chamber, said that Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, was hysterically and temporarily unfit to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted like this, it would be called hysterical," Pelosi said about his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Commission on Thursday
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all sexual abuse connections to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made a statement of emotional openness, sometimes in a stifling and soluble voice, speaking of his family and years of high school.
He also explicitly accused the Committee's Democrats of adjudicating the allegations made against himself of "grass and conspiracy murder" organized by liberals who were being held by Hillary Clinton had lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he has no conditions to serve in the Supreme Court because of his preconceived behaviour against the Democrats.
"I think he has dequalified himself with his statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
When asked if he would try to challenge the effective appointment of Kavanaugh and if the Democrats would win the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
"What I can say is that if you lie to Congress or the FBI, you don't meet the conditions to be in the Supreme Court, or even to serve in your current court," Pelosi said.
At present, Kavanaugh is a judge in the Court of the Circumsification Report of D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he received potential opinions from Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act (more known by Obamacare) or the Roe vs Wade case, given the reputation of being a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh raised questions about the possibility of abrogating certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not a time to choose someone hysterical and preconceived to the Supreme Court and to expect us to be happy with the decision," Pelosi said.
Women need to know how to control their emotions.
It's a justified diatribe, months and years of fury to cross, and can't escape without crying.
"We met when we went," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"Don't I think it's weird, don't you think?"
A woman with an executive position in a company helped me tremendously. She told me that she also cried when she was angry, but had created a technique. When she was angry and started crying, she said to the person I was talking to, "Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And he kept going.
And I thought to myself... it's brilliant," Mrs. Steinem went on.
The tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are misunderstood.
I remember perfectly, in an old job in an office dominated by men in which he was crying unexpressable anger, being gripped by an older woman's neck - an unfriendly manager who threatened me a little - and literally dragged to the stairs to hear me say
"Never let them see you cry."
"They don't know if you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're going to be happy that they got to affect you."
Patricia Schroeder, on the date of the Democratic Congress of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his candidacy with the presidents.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship on board a boat called Monkey Business and quit the candidacy, an extremely frustrated Patricia Schroeder did not see why she could not apply herself to the presidents.
"It wasn't a very thoughty decision," he told me to laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates and one was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who called the situation "The Snow White and the Seven Years."
Given its late entry, the fund-raiser was just the desired one and swore that it would only enter the race if it managed to raise $2 million.
A battle doomed to defeat.
He discovered that some of his sympathies gave him only 250 dollars, although they had given $1,000 to male candidates.
"Do you think I'm entitled to a discount?" he asked.
When he announced that he would not enter a formal campaign, the emotions came to the top - thank you for the people who had supported it, frustration with a system that raised so many obstacles to fund-raising and to bring the message to voters instead of delegates, and anger against sexism - and tears arose.
"It seemed that she was depressed," recalled Patricia Schroeder when she spoke about the reaction of the media.
"I'd have thought Kleinex was my business sponsor.
What would you write in my epitaph now?
"She cried?"
How the trade war between the US and China can be beneficial to Beijing
The first rescue of the trade war between the US and China was absurd, and although the end of the conflict is not in sight, in the eyes of the experts, the removal of the two countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, fired the first warning in the beginning of the year by taxing important Chinese imports including solar, steel and aluminium panels.
This week was the stage of a significant deterioration in the situation with the new rates to affect goods worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), taxing in reality half of all goods sent by China to the United States.
Beijing has always accounted for the same currency, with a recent increase of 5 to 10 per cent for American goods worth $60,000 million.
China has committed itself to following U.S. steps and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will come to vacillate in the coming days.
Making Washington back would mean meeting the demands, but showing a public subservience to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its trumps, the pressures imposed by the trade war with the US can support China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"In fact, the fact that Washington's or Beijing's interim political decision can result in an economic crisis in both countries is much more dangerous than observers could have anticipated," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher dedicated to Asia's study at the Center for New American Security, a reflection group.
Minister for Foreign Affairs says Syria is ready for refugee return
Syria claims to be prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven long years of war.
In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem stated that the country's conditions are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
There are now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who have left due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who have stayed in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulem said that the Syrian regime would receive a good deal of help for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries sponsoring the revolt.
Europe beats Ryder Cup in Paris
The selection of Europe beats the U.S. and wins the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National around Paris, France.
The U.S. has now accumulated six consecutive defeats in European soil since the last time they defeated Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe returned to victory after the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The North American star Phil Mickelson, who proved to have serious difficulties during almost all the tournament, took the tea off to the water at the hole 16, par 3, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined on all its rounds, becoming 1 of the 4 players to get 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Speeth lost 5&4 for the worst-class player in the selection of Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's most well-classified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 for Ian Poulter of England where he may have been his last participation in Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most prized European of all tournaments with 25.5 career points.
"It's not my habit to cry, but today I couldn't contain myself.
It was a tough year.
I can't stop thanking Thomas for choosing and believing in me.
I'm so happy that we beat the cup.
It was all a team effort and I am happy to have been able to help," said an emotional Garcia after the victory of Europe.
Pass the word to his compatriot Jon Rham who defeated the legend of the North American Gulf, Tiger Woods, by 2&1 in singulars on Sunday.
"It is impossible to describe the pride I feel for defeating Tiger Woods. I grew to see him play," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 at Ryder Cup.
Uninhibited statistical values of one of the greatest players of all time with 14 great titles won and only hit by Jack Nicklus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had a high-calibre performance throughout the tournament, the remaining elements of the U.S. Selection were debated by reaching the fairway.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, spoke after his team's disappointing performance. "I'm proud of them. They fought.
This morning, we managed to put some fear in Europe.
Let's fight.
My congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All your 12 players were excellent.
We will reorganize and work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to continue.
I like many of these 12 players and I am proud to be their captain.
I have to take the hat off to the other team.
They were better."
