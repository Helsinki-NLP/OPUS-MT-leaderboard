The main task of the kings was to build a tomb from which it was thought that it would seem as timeless as the stars over the sand of time, in which everything else faded. The planning of the succession was more important than the life itself, which was only the way there. Wars led them to remember peacefully at the walls of this tomb, in which the scenes were laid. Of course, much was surprised, and in later times even battles were presented that had not even taken place.
