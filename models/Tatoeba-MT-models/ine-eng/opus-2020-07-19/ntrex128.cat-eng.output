Members of the Galles Assembly worried about "Identifying them as Muppets"
Several members of the House expressed their condolences to the proposal to amend their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Gallès Parliament).
This debate is rooted in the plan to change the name of the Assembly by the Galician Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all the different political parties have shown their concern that this measure can become a cause for mockery.
A member of the labor party's assembly has said that his party was concerned about the fact that MWP "resides with Twp or Pwp".
For non-galley readers: In galleys, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party's assembly commented that the party's set "do not see it with good eyes" and proposed various alternatives.
For his part, a Gallesian conservative member said that his group was "open" in front of the name change, but he also commented that there was too little difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it must be said that the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced in a similar way to the letter "u" in Yorkshire.
According to the committee responsible for drafting the legal draft to introduce changes in names: "The final decision on any qualification to appoint members of the assembly will of course take place in its own members."
The Law of 2017 of the Government of Wales gives the Assembly of Wales all the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals, with a broad support for the proposal to change the name of the Assembly by the Galáles Parliament.
With regard to the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee was called upon by "Members of the Galles Parliament" or "WPM", the option of "MWP" is the one that received a broader support in public consultation.
It seems that the members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives, but the attempt to reach a consensus may imply a complete curse on the President of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on the changes in the matter of weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the assembly will vote definitively on their name during the legislative debate.
Macedonians will vote in referendum to change the name of their country
Citizens will choose Sunday whether or not to change the name of their country for the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular consultation was decided in an attempt to resolve a dispute that lasted for decades with neighboring Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has insisted for a long time on the fact that the name of its North neighbour represents a way to claim its territory and has repeatedly opposed its attempts to form part of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed to the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, those in favour, like Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change of name is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells stop ringing: the difficulties of Harlem's churches
"Historically, the big people I've spoken to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's none left, both of them."
According to Adams, the disappearance of bars can be understood.
"People have another way of socializing today," he says.
"The bars have stopped being that kind of living room for the neighborhood where people went on a regular basis."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money that comes from the sale of assets does not last as long as his leaders predict "and that sooner or later they return to the place where they came out."
The churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartments and condominiums with people who won't be of any help to the temples in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be of a white race," he says, "and so what they will do will accelerate the closure of all churches, since it is quite unlikely that the majority of people who move to these condominiums will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the church of Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist congregation that originally existed in the 1930 ’ s left.
A black congregation nearby acquired the property of the building.
St. Martin's passed to the hands of a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to minority traders in 125th Street, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who refused to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when the gladiator Johnson made plans to rebuild it, it was then when they commissioned the carriage.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to the church of St. Martin's, proudly described the carriage as "the campaigns of poor people."
The expert who made the carriage sound the July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng, at the University of Michigan, also observed that it was the first black-racing band in the world, Dionysius A. Lind, who had to move to the largest band of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What he has sounded to St. Martin's over the past few months, on the other hand, has been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them carried by the lay leaders of the church and others by the bishop diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, formed by lay leaders, wrote in the diocese last July while expressing its concern that the diocese "would attempt to pass the costs" to the council, although this latter was not involved in the contraction of the architects and contractors that the diocese sent.
Some happy people have complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A bull wounds a 13-year-old boy while looking for mice in California
A bull attacked and wounded a 13-year-old child on Saturday while he was drowning in search of hostages in California on the first day of the plague season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel on the KSWB-TV in San Diego, he spent half an hour busing with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the screams of a boy asking for help, and then they met with a group up to where the boy was to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was the joy of having taken a bite, but then he realized that he was calling 'I' had bitten!
I've been bitten!'
He had all the broken keys," he observed Hammel when he got to the boy.
"Because everyone gets out of the water, I called out, 'There's a bull in the water!' says Hammel.
The boy was transported by air to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego, where he was admitted into a serious state.
We don't know what kind of bull is responsible for the attack.
On a press wheel, a relief worker, Larry Giles, commented that he had been working for a few weeks that had detected a bull in the area, but that it was decided that this species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper area of the tower.
The authorities closed their access to the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours because of research and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of bull in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
The plans of Sainsbury's, to the UK's market for beauty products
Sainsbury's decided to compete in Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with fashionable products in the style of large stores occupied with specialized employees.
These large passages are only part of a considerable investment in the UK's beauty products market, a market that moves around GBP 2800 million and continues to grow while the fashion and household products sectors remain behind, and 11 stores across the country will be tried to expand to more shops in the year ahead if the test is successful.
Investment in beauty products is a product of the greed of supermarkets to take advantage of the space in their facilities that were previously intended for televisions, microns and household products.
Sainsbury's claims that it will double its offer of beauty to offer up to 3000 different products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space with areas of similar brands that can be found in shops like Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the process of relaunching its range of boutique makeup products so that most products are now suitable for vegans, an increasingly demanding aspect for younger consumers.
The Minorist Chain The Fragrance Shop, in addition, will open concessions to two Sainsbury's stores. The first one did so last week in Croydon, south of London, while the second one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and changing the habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day in small supermarkets has led large supermarkets to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, stores will increasingly resemble large stores in an attempt by supermarkets to fight off Aldi and Lidl supermarkets with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's went by introducing Argos' sales points to many of its supermarkets, besides a number of Habitat stores since he acquired both chains two years ago, which, he comments, has served to relaunch the purchases and increase the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to relaunch its department of beauty products and pharmaceuticals resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's attempted a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended up all of a sudden not agreeing on how to divide the benefits of the pharmaceutical chain into supermarkets.
This new strategy came up after the sale three years ago by Sainsbury's of its business of 281 pharmaceuticals in Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for GBP 125 million.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will have an important role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury products for skin, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, comments: "We have transformed the look of our fashionable products to improve the face-to-face environment for our customers.
We have invested in workers specifically formats that will be of great help in offering advice.
Our brand range is designed to adapt to any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and the practical location make us now one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and challenge the traditional way of making an understanding."
Peter Jones "fry" after Holly Willoughby is behind a 11-million-dollar deal.
Dragons' Den Peter Jones star went off "furish" after the Holly Willoughby TV show was made behind a 11 million GBP deal with Jones' lifestyle brand business to focus on their new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to devote himself to the joint business of home products and Truly accessories.
The business of these two media characters had come to compare with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This 37 - year - old presenter used Instagram to announce his departure.
Holly Willoughby has left the Dragons' star Den Peter Jones angry at withdrawing in the last minute of his profitable life-style business to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring him great benefits.
According to various sources, Jones was "furnished" when the star red of television admitted, during a tense meeting held in his capital on Tuesday in his empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new agreements of the presenter, worth GBP 1.5 million, implied that he would no longer have enough time to devote to the joint brand of household products and accessories True.
The business had come to compare with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at GBP 11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones took a private plane toward one of his vacation homes outside the United Kingdom.
According to one source, "Truly was far from Holly's main priority.
He was destined to be his long - term future, where he would be seen for the next 20 or 30 years.
His decision to go back left without a word all the parts involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Right now there's a warehouse full of merchandise in Marlow's centre ready to be sold."
According to experts, the departure of this Morning presenter, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost millions to the company due to the important investment that had been made in products, from kitchens and candles to clothing and household clothing, and the possibility of delays in its release.
Besides, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin had kept a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly along with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined him in charge of the president last March.
Both couples spend their vacation together, and Jones has 40 percent of the participation in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will be the next M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the I'm A Celebrity of the ITV program.
A source close to Jones last night commented that "We won't make any comment about his business."
Hard accusations... "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the possible criticisms he received by the media to make a comment that some would consider "less of a president" and to have such a positive opinion from the North Korean leader.
Why did he give up Trump so much?
Trump said, while making a noise noise noise from a news reporter:
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first June in Singapore was declared a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations for denuclearization are underway.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho commented on Saturday to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "response" by the US at the first disarmament initiatives made by its country.
He noted, however, that the US continues to apply sanctions with the aim of maintaining pressure.
Trump's point of view, in contrast, was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to declare the war in North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now we keep this great relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have had positive results: ending tests with missiles, helping to free hostages, and returning home to the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his little usual focus on the relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be Presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this neighborhood full of people, we'd have about 200," Trump said, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
A destroyed island and hundreds of deaths due to tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was said to non-governmental organizations in other countries that were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, which was required in order to catalyze international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so that the situation is highly demanding," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not certain that foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Disasters Agency, commented that the Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies were allowed to contribute at the time of offering assistance.
Because of the constant droughts in Indonesia, the country is unfortunately not prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although Aceh has been built in case of tsunamis, they are not frequent at other costs.
The apparent lack of alert sirens in Palu in the case of tsunamis, although there was a warning in force, is very likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the huge amount of them in Indonesia is, in the best case, a whole challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was caught in Lombok to deal with the victims of the earthquake is now headed to Palu; however, it will take at least three days to arrive at the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as the central element of his election campaign the improvement of Indonesia's poor infrastructure, and has invested huge amounts of money in roads and railway routes.
However, Joko's government faces the year it comes to the collection of funding deficits.
Joko also faces the pressure of the country's permanent sectarian tensions, where most Muslims have adopted a more conservative faith.
More than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of displaced persons are the result of the wars that take place in the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs with hammers, bows and arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Note: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool is the goal of the summit with a far-off court in front of Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the First League in front of Chelsea with his goal marked on the 89th minute in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a passage from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's gate when his team was losing 1 to 0.
The pilot was accommodated to the left before leaving an incredible court headed for the second suit.
The shot crossed the whole area with a great lift as it moved towards the right cross of the gate.
The pilot finally launched the descent over a full-run Kepa Arrizabalaga to try to stop her and ended up at the bottom of the network.
"I was just trying to get to that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible," Sturridge at LiverpoolFC.com comments.
"I saw Kanté coming, I made a touch, and I didn't think much of it, I just dedicated myself to playing."
Chelsea won 1 to 0 in a break after marking a goal at 25 a minute through her Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the game, the front of the Blue team went back to Mateo Kovacic before starting from almost half the camp and jumping to the Liverpool camp.
Kovacic made a quick combination from the middle of the field.
Next, he made a magnificent past in depth, leaving Hazard in the area with the controlled pilot.
Hazard overcome the defense to finish the second suit with a jute with the left bed where the porter of Liverpool Alison Becker could not reach.
Liverpool will face Naples at the championship league group stage next Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, for her part, will play with the video at UEFA Europe League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of deaths for Indonesia's tsunami in 832
The number of deaths as a result of earthquakes and tsunamis has increased to 832, according to data from the country's disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped between the ruins of the ruined buildings due to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that took place on Friday and caused waves up to 6 meters, according to the spokesman of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho on a press wheel.
The city of Palu, of more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the ruins of destroyed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect after finding a woman stabbed
Murder investigation started after the woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with several punches at Grayson Mews, John Street; then a 32-year-old man was arrested as a murder suspect.
The police have asked the people in the area who have seen or heard anything about the crime they're dealing with in front of the authorities.
According to Inspector Brian O'Hagan, "If the investigation is still at a preliminary stage, I would like to make a call to everyone who is near John Street at Birkenhead and who has seen or felt anything suspicious, that he may contact us.
I would also like to make a call to anyone, especially to the cab drivers who could have picked up anything through the car-side camera, who are being contacted, as they could have vital information for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman they found was Birkenhead's body and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As the investigation continues, the police have commented that they are reporting the facts to relatives closest to the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police have informed him that no one has allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he ran out of words.
He's warning the residents that they'll spend hours until they can get back in.
He could feel like a police officer telling a man that the whole area is treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene crying.
Don't stop saying, "It's terrible!"
At 14:00 a.m., two police vehicles were in the area agreed with another train parked outside.
A number of officers remained within the agreed area controlling the building block.
Anyone is asked to have information to send a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously via 0800 555 111 and mention the issue 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of the British Parliament became the last monument affected by the discussion around "rewriting history"
Its disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the destruction of the most pure-style Taliban of so many cultural and religious objects in England perpetrated by their puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "crazy" and an "intent of rewriting the story."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate about the withdrawal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would become one of the main objectives.
The iconoclasty of English civil wars was not ordered or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for his predecessor's actions that he did during the last century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the 19th century's opinion and part of the story of a figure that many still believe is worthy of being remembered.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than not now, as a advocate of parliament in front of external pressure, in his case obviously of the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a completely accurate representation is a theme of historical debate.
What is true is that the 17th-century media conflict was the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a banner of this division.
Their adjournments as Lord Protector are also worthy to be celebrated and commemorated."
A killer pig kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, reports local sources.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a cut artery and all covered with blood near a pig market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, as reported Sunday China Morning Post.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject pigs' vaccines in a court in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
As far as we know, he had traveled on Wednesdays with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave him a concussion of pigs.
According to him, there was a big male pig in the court with blood in his mouth.
Forensic examination confirmed that 250 kg of barley had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin had his legs torn and full of blood," said the cousin, by the name "Wu," as mentioned in the news of Guiyang evening.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show how Yuan enters the market at 4:40 in the morning of Thursday to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market officials commented on the news of the evening that the pig remained closed and isolated so as to avoid attacking anyone else, while the police gathered the evidence at the crime scene.
According to information, Yuan's family and market leaders are negotiating a compensation for their death.
Although very rare, there have been cases of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their Massachusetts farm, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a pig of nearly 300 kg took a galley farm against his tractor until his wife could scare the animal.
After a Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told the CBC news that pigs are usually not aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "degrading".
"They like to play.
They're like children, they're very curious... they don't have the idea of doing anything wrong.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve," he commented.
The remains of the Rosa hurricane will bring torrential rains all over the southwestern United States
According to the prognostics, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it progresses over the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, the Rosa will bring torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and southwestern America during the next few days.
The Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, owning a Category 1 hurricane at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, hours east of the United States, and was located 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, it is beginning to form a depression in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving towards the west coast of the United States. As the Rosa approaches the peninsula of Lower California on Monday as a tropical storm, she will start to leave a strong tropical humidity in the north toward the south-west of the United States.
The Rosa will leave up to 250 mm of rain on some parts of Mexico.
Afterwards, tropical humidity will interact with the depression that is approaching to generate torrential rains widespread throughout the south-west during the next few days.
At various points, between 25 and 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous rivers, waste streams and the possibility of land slavery in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause some precipitation rates of about 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected from 50 to 100 mm of rain on the south-west, especially in much of Arizona.
There's a possibility that they're laughing, as the situation is getting worse very quickly because of the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is totally discouraged to enter the desert on foot in front of the tropical rain threat.
Torrent rains could cause gorges to become uncontrollable rivers. In addition, storms can bring windmills and dust clouds to concrete points.
The approaching depression will bring torrential rains to certain points on the southern coast of California.
Total precipitations over 50 mm may be recorded, which could cause lower waste streams and reliable pathways.
This would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
They'll begin to arrive at tropical rain-sucking in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more widespread between Monday and Tuesday night.
The torrential rains will spread to the region of the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue throughout the entire Wednesday.
October there will be several important temperature oscillations for all the U.S. as the Arctic cooled down, although the tropicals will remain very warm.
This phenomenon can sometimes cause dramatic changes in temperature at a short distance.
The U.S. Central Region on Sunday is a clear example of drastic temperature differences.
Temperature differences of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa have been recorded.
During the next few days, the persistent heat of summer will try to expand again.
It is expected that the month of October will start with heat in large parts of the central and eastern US, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the Southern Plans area to parts of the north-east.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, representing about 10 degrees above the average.
According to the long-term forecast, there are many possibilities that temperatures are recorded above the average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million spectators saw Brett Kavanaugh's statement
More than 20 million spectators saw Thursday the passionate witness of the candidate in the Supreme Court member Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which was supposed to take place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford. The witness was broadcast to six different television chains.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with the broadcasters interrupting the usual Friday programming due to a turn of events in the last minute: an agreement designed by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake to put an end to the FBI's investigation of the charges for a week.
Ford explained to the Senate committee on judicial matters that he was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a school party.
Kavanaugh, in a exalted witness, claimed that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million spectators are likely to have seen this witness on Friday.
The company counted the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
Hearing figures were not immediately available for other chains that transmitted the witness, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen alone has trouble calculating the people he sees from his office.
From a perspective, it's a hearing similar to that of an American football party or Oscar's ceremony.
Fox News Channel, the opinion leaders who clearly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the most audienceed chain, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the day's witness, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second to 3.26 million spectators.
CBS achieved 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen's data.
The interest remains high after the witness.
Flake was the central figure of the Friday drama.
After the office of the moderate republican issued a communiqué saying that they would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, Flake was captured by the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while he was instigated by demonstrators when he was trying to climb a lift to go to a view of the Judicial Affairs Committee.
Flake stayed several minutes with her eyebrows while she was live on TV at CNN.
"Here you have me, in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
They told him 'you have power, while there are so many women who don't have it!'
Flake said his office had issued a communiqué and, before the elevator doors were closed, commented he would have more to say in the committee's view.
Within a few hours, all cable and broadcasting chains were already streamlining directly at the time when the Judicial Committee had to vote whether or not to proceed with the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate to submit it to the vote.
Flake said, instead, that he would only understand that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the face-to-face appointment next week, a condition required by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a subsequent conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
The option chosen by Flake was influenced, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" in relation to Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticised their plans to abandon the European Union to "play politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and to undermine national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In a further interview with May on the cover of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister May Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit, stating that the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU collect taxes together is "of all absurdity".
The murder of Wayde Sims: Police arrested Suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU team player
The police arrested a suspect for shooting off Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who was fighting the LSU team.
Dyteon Simpson, a 20-year-old, has been arrested and sent to a second-degree murder charge, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities made public a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA in them, according to the WAFB's branch.
After asking Simpson, this guy admitted to killing Wayde from a gunshot, according to the police.
His loan is set at $3500,000, as the lawyer reports.
The Forensic Office of the East Baton Rouge District issued a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head in the direction of the neck.
The department is grateful for the operational group of fugitives from the state police in Louisiana, the state police crime lab, the South University police, and the community's citizens for the assistance they have provided in the investigation that has culminated in this detention.
The sports director of LSU Joe Alleva expressed his gratitude to the forces of the order of the area for his "diligence and seeking justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
At a distance of 1,988 m, he played the field and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player on the LSU team.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 turns to break last season.
On Friday morning, LSU Will Wade's basketball coach commented that the team was "distorted" and that Wade's death was "a very strong time."
"Things like this are the things that make you suffer at all times," said Wade.
A sprint volcano in Mexico City
The ashes dug by the Volcano Popocatepetl have reached the neighborhoods of the southern capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexicans on Saturday that they were kept away from the volcano after they detected activity on the crater and registered 183 gas and ashes within 24 hours.
The center was overseeing several strepts and tremors that had occurred recently.
Images on social networks where a fine layer of ashes is appreciated in the umbrellas of cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Joachimilco.
Geophysics have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano 72 km south-east of the capital since a magnitude earthquake of 7.1 shook the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police are dealing with Catalan separatists shortly before the referendum on independence anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after protesters in favour of independence confronted the anti-avoidal police and thousands of people joined in protests to remember the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalonia on its secession.
A group of independent individuals detained by the anti-avault police began to throw eggs and paint in dust, which caused the appearance of dark clouds of dust in the streets normally invaded by tourists.
Later that same day, he was beaten by the police, who used his fists to contain violent protesters.
For several hours, independent groups sang "Don't forget, don't forgive" face to face with unionist protestors calling "Long Life in Spain."
Fourteen people had to be exposed to minor injuries during protests, depending on local sources.
The tensions have not diminished in this region of independent mentality a year after October 1st was held a referendum considered illegal by Madrid but also due to the Catalan separatists.
Voters chose independence for a vast majority, although the participation index was low, as the opposition to the section boycotted the vote mostly.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting in electoral colleges throughout the region, causing violent confrontations.
Independent groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support to the national police.
The event also took place, but the demonstrators were forced to take another route.
Narcís Termes, a 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independent demonstration together with his wife, said that he had little hope of the possibilities that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year we lived one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote, but now we're stuck," she said.
Despite gaining a vital victory, although in a short time, in the autonomous elections last December, the Catalan independent parties have suffered to maintain the momentum this year, as many of their main leaders are in an auto-imposed or detained exile awaiting trial on their paper in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the police support demonstration with his phone, and said that the conflict had begun with the politicians of both sides.
"Tension only increases," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned before the trial of last year, announced that he would participate in the elections in the European Parliament next year.
"Presenting as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the backwardness in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after investing a house with a car
Three men 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after a car repeatedly invaded a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says damage was caused to the doors and to the same building.
It's also possible, at some point, someone shot a bullet at the car.
A Menga game gives the Livingston win for 1 to 0 in front of the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingstone assumed victory
Livingstone, who had come up this year, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in which everything was the second defeat of Steven Gerrard in 18 games as a coach of the Ibrox district club.
Dolly Menga's game marked the difference, because with this victory, Gary Holt's team is in second position, which share with the Hibernate.
Gerrard's men, in exchange, continue without winning out at the Premiership this season, and next Sunday they will face the leader, the Hearts, with whom they will be separated by eight points.
But before that, the Rangers receive this Thursday the Viena Rapid in Europe League.
The Livingstone, meanwhile, expands to six parties its inviolable box in the league, with a Holt as a coach who still doesn't know what defeat is since Kenny Miller replaced last month.
Livingstone does not take advantage of its opportunities in front of the visitors' live game
Holt's team should have gone ahead of the marker long before the goal, as its direct game caused all kinds of problems in the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened his way between the defense, but he abused his chance when he was in front of the gate. Then Alan Lithgow sent the pilot out to try to finish Craig Halkett's head, which crossed the gate.
The locals were better off letting Rangers get to their area, as they knew they could put the visitors in trouble in isolated games.
And that's how this decisive goal came to be.
The orbit shook a gap against Rangers' interests and Livingstone opened up to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so that Menga could touch it first and finish it from the central part of the area.
Until then, Rangers had dominated possession, but he met with an impenetrable defense and a porter Liam Kelly who had very little work during the party,
The scene was repeated on the other side, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a farewell stop.
For his part, Rangers Allan McGregor's porter stopped with his feet one occasion by Scott Pittman and Lithgow ended up diverting another liveston combination game.
The Rangers were dedicated to hanging once and another pilot in the Livingstone area, just to be rejected, and they were claimed two fines, one for a supposed Halket's entry to the Glenn Middleton replacement, and one for a hand, both of which were dismissed.
Livingstone "phenomenal": analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingstone.
A man thinks they were excellent, and they continue to surpass all expectations in this uplifting trajectory.
Their game style and staff have hardly changed since they returned to the highest category, although much of the merit has to be attributed to Holt for the way he has galvanized the team since his arrival.
There was a good bunch of heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, at the head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be hanging from Menga throughout the game.
Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
Despite the brilliant moments presented with Gerard as a coach, they definitely didn't know how to keep the level.
They didn't know how to create occasions (only once they clearly exceeded the local defense), and this Rangers, who is in the middle of the table, should take it as a warning.
Aggressive reception for Erdogan in Cologne
They were all smiling and clear on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders from Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, which was intended to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan, then, moved to Cologne to launch a new giant mosque.
And it's that this city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside Turkey.
The police set up security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers joined around to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors opposed Erdogan, many of them Kurds, were also made to feel as they condemned Erdogan's policies as well as the German government's decision to welcome the country.
Both manifestations reflect the division of views around the visitor, considered a hero for some German Turks and titled dictator for others.
Deptford traffic accident: a cyclist dies meeting a car
A cyclist died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the street corner of the Beswod Street and Evelyn Street, a strong-traffic area in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m. local.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although the paramedics took care of the cyclist, he died in the act.
The accident occurs months after another cyclist dies in a case of an atrophy with a flight to Childers Street, 1.6 km from the site of the Saturday accident.
Metro police said their agents are working to identify the man and inform relatives of the facts.
The street has been cut off and deviations have been applied for bus routes. In addition, drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six agents injured in an altercat
Six prison officers have been injured in an altercation in this high-security men's prison center, according to the centre's office.
The facts occurred in Long Lartin's prison, Worcestershire, at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, local time, and still persist.
Specialized "back" agents moved up to the scene to put an end to the altercation, where eight prisoners were involved. The avalot could be held by one band.
The officers had to be careful about the injuries in the face instead of the facts.
According to a spokesperson for the prison service, "We have deployed specially trained prison personnel to try to resolve an incident that occurred in Long Martin's prison, which still persists.
Six employees had to be careful with injuries.
We're not going to tolerate violence in our prisons, and we're sure that those in charge of this altercation will have to pay back to the police and they might have to spend even more time in the garjole."
There are more than 500 inmates in Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was known that the head of the prison had to be put in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, anti-aircraft agents took action in prison to resolve a serious altercation in which the center's staff was attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with important rivers (the areas with even could be beneficial)
It's not common for tropical depression to affect Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen at the beginning of the week that comes when what's left of Hurricane Rosa passes through the south-west desert, with the resulting risk of laughter.
The national weather service has already alerted the rivers for Mondays and Tuesdays west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to arrive directly in Phoenix on Tuesday and approach Monday night with rains.
Phoenix's national weather service commented on a pillage that "only ten tropical cyclists have maintained the state of tropical storm or depression in a radius of 322 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) stayed 64 km from the border with Arizona."
The latest models in the national centre of hurricanes provide 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated points where they will be registered up to 150 mm in the Mogollon in Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west desert, including the Central Rocky and the Great Conca, could be recorded from 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points up to 100 mm.
For areas that are at risk of rivers, the rain of the Rose could become a very good news, since the region suffers from a severe drought.
Although laughter is a serious cause of concern, some of the precipices could be very beneficial, as the region of the south-west currently suffers from a drought.
According to the US drought control service, more than 40% of Arizona's state suffers at least extreme, the second highest category, reports weather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will play ground at the California Low Peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa continued to have force of hurricane on Sunday mornings, with winds of up to 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, which makes it lose power.
So it's expected to hit land in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or Monday evening.
Precipitation in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of laughter.
According to weather.com, "a total of 75 to 150 mm of rain is expected from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 250 mm."
After that, the Rosa will head north across Mexico with tropical storm force, before arriving at the border with Arizona in the first hour of the morning with tropical depression force, to finally cross Arizona state and reach south of Utah well entered on Tuesday night.
"The main risk that we expect from Rosa or what remains of it is very strong precipitation in Lower California, the northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States," according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.
Rains are expected to cause dangerous rivers and waste streams in the deserts, lovers of land slavery in the mountainous areas.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: four detainees for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with gunshots in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton by 4:00 a.m. on Saturday, local time.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he was found "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested the next day in Radstock's area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
Agents have made a call because any person who can have any kind of record of the facts with the phone is contacted.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered the misery and anger" of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to reject the ruthless and annoying tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump decreed in an election act in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has "painted the mosque and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh stated in front of Congress on Thursday, firmly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of having sexually abused her for decades when they were both teenagers.
Ford also declared in the view in relation to his associate.
The president said Saturday that, on that day, "the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, human quality and bravery."
"The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the brightest minds of the legal world of our time, a lawyer with an amazing service path in the city," he commented to the crowd of Western Virginia sympathizers.
The president referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the voter participation index in the mid-term elections.
"We're five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I didn't run, but actually I did," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for our big candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are dedicated to "resisting and obstructing".
It is expected that the first key procedural vote to be held in the Kavanaugh Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will take place as late as Friday, according to CNN, an assistant of the leaders of the Republican Party has reported.
Hundreds of deaths from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, where the number of victims continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, and many have been dragged by the waves of giants flying against the beaches, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a festival held on the beach in Palu city when waves of up to six meters hit the coast toward the end of the day, dragging many of the people to death and destroying everything they found on their way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
"When the threat came by tsunami yesterday, people were still putting their activities on the beach and didn't run away immediately, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, quoted from the BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, trunks, houses, destroyed everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before impacting the coast.
There are people who climbed up a tree running from the tsunami and were able to survive, he says.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency where the amount of destroyed shops and buildings, turned bridges and cracks and a mixed water is appreciated.
The replicas continued to shake this coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquake series were heard in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that energy released by the earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the city's geographical characteristics, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the volume of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as being "considerable" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he says, were found trapped among the ruins of broken buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were displaced.
According to Nugroho, the deaths and damage could increase on the coast about 300 km north of Palu, a zone called Dongala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications "were completely paralyzed and therefore no information came," says Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross commented in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, which unfortunately could end much worse," she says.
The agency was strongly criticised on Saturday not to report the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although the agents said the waves arrived during the time the alert was issued.
In a recording of a social media associate, it can be felt as a man standing on the top floor of a building gives desperate warnings to street people about the approaching tsunami.
In the matter of minutes, a water wall bursts at the edge of the sea, carrying buildings and vehicles.
Reuters was not able to authenticate to record immediately.
Earthquake and tsunami have caused a widespread cut of the power supply that has interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Despite the fact that the army has begun sending humanitarian aid to cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, the evacuations continue to need food desperately, in addition to other basic needs.
The city's airport is only reopened for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths for Indonesia's tsunami is above 800.
The situation is very serious.
Despite the fact that World Vision workers in Dongala were able to arrive safely and safely in the city of Palu, where the employees were accommodated in shelters installed in the courtyard of their office, during the journey they had to present scenes of total destruction, says Doseba.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's a disaster.
While the relief groups did the disappointing gesture of launching relief tasks, some people complained that they were preventing humanitarian workers from travelling to Palu.
According to the Indonesian regulations, the collection of funds, provisions and staffing of foreign personnel can only begin to flow if the place where a disaster occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, "Well, it's a national disaster," we can start asking for international assistance, but this level has not yet been declared."
While it was the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that took place on Friday, the friends and relatives of the missing people kept the hope that the miracle and their loved ones would escape the devastating account of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was rescued trapped in a locker.
Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next door.
Gendon Subandano, the trainer of the national Indian paragliding team, had trained two of the paraglided paragliders for the Asian Games, which were concluded early this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, there were his students.
"As a senior in the area of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon explained that, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel between the parapentist community, he had sent desperate messages for WhatsApp to Palu competitors who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages appeared with a grey check mark instead of a blue double mark.
"I think this means that the messages were not received," he added.
Thieves take $26,750 while filling an automatic boxer in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, a thief stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling up an automatic boxer at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport Police Department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy indicated to the vehicle driver that the driver was emptying the auto box in the entertainment complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While he was doing his job, another man "was running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money for distribution.
According to the statement, the witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper renames to Ye
The Kanye West rapper changes its name to Ye.
On Saturday, as he announced the change to Twitter, he wrote: "To be formally known as Kanye West."
A long time ago, in the West, 41-year-old, he was motorized by the nickname Ye, and he used this alias as the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change takes place before its appearance in the Saturday Night Live program, which is expected to present its new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons", according to the author of the program.
Apart from being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think it's the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you," said West in the beginning of this year, talking about the title of his album with the Big Boy radio presenter.
"So it's you, it's us.
I've gone from Kanye, which means the only one, just ye, that is a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, all.
The album is rather a reflection than we are."
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has known him by various names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former West co-worker, has been worth his last name with or without script and in capitals.
Mexico President AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised never to use the military force against civilians, when the country lacks little time to complete the 50th anniversary of a severe reprisal against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that "the military force would never be used again to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the death of 300 people at a time when left student movements were rooting across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador, who has committed to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
He said that the stop and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
The US should duplicate IA funds
"While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of money devoted to research in this field," says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and professional specialist in artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the North American Government have announced measures in the field of IA, although there is a general lack of formal strategy in the country in IA.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number 1 of the world in terms of innovation in IA in 2030.
"Dublining the IA research budget would be a good start, as the rest of the countries are far behind the US and we want to be pioneers of the next advances in the IA field," Lee pointed out.
"Duplicate funding could double the opportunities for the US to join the next great discovery in IA," Lee told CNBC in an interview that took place this week.
Lee, author of the book AI SuperPowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in Face++, one of China's most prominent IA companies.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an I.A. system that surpassed Othello's American player with the best ranking and then exercised as executive in Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee positively evaluated previous technological competitions of the North American Government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects (DARPA), and wondered when the next one would take place to identify the next visionaries.
"Sovint, North American researchers have to work hard to get public scholarships," Lee said.
According to Lee, "It's not China that takes academic leaders; it's companies."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university graduates to work in the field of IA.
Lee commented that the work of the US in the field of IA could also be driven by changes in immigration policy.
"I think they should automatically offer permanent residence cards to doctoral students in IA," he added.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its latest generation artificial intelligence development plan.
"The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China grants funds to people from academic institutions in the same way that the Foundation for Natural Sciences and other US public bodies give money to North American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower than China," Lee pointed out.
At the beginning of the year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre, designed to involve industrial industry and academic institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a select Artificial Intelligence Committee.
In addition, DARPA has announced an investment of $2,000 million this month in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to the Natural Sciences Foundation, more than 100 million USD are currently being spent each year in research in IA.
In the meantime, months ago, no measures were applied in relation to North American legislation, which was intended to create a National Security Commission in Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the change of name to the "Northern Republic of Macedonia", a step that would resolve a dispute that has existed since decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's requests for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of its North neighbour constitutes a claim from its territory and has pledged its entry to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the slave population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign questioned whether he would reach the minimum required participation of 50% to make the referendum valid.
The question on the referendum's paper is "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU, with the consent of the agreement with Greece?"
The name change partners, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to comply with Macedonia's accession, one of the countries that were created from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to organizations such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia can live freely in the European Union, because it means that we will all have a safer life," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have shown that they will deliver the result of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority is required in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission reported that no irregularities had occurred at 1 p.m.
However, participation was only 16%, compared with 34% recorded in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of the registered people voted.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted for Macedonia's referendum on the country's name change, which would open the way for accession to the European Union and NATO to Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small scenario and placing chairs in front of the tents installed by people who boycotted the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with the high head, not by the back door," Kavadarkov explained.
"I'm a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can resort to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO integration will be accompanied by investments more than you would need in Macedonia, which has a rate of more than 20%.
"I think the vast majority will vote for it, because more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev pointed out before depositing his paper.
Zaev showed that a 'yes' would mean 'confirming our future'.
In a poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum required participation.
According to the results of another survey, led by the Macedonian chain Telma TV, 57% of the polls are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said I would vote 'yes'.
For the referendum to be valid, participation must be 50% more than one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first hard one for the pro-Western government policy since it took the lead last May.
Look at the video: Sergio Aguéero, Manchester City, has a goal after flying the whole of Brighton's defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling cancelled Brighton's defense in Manchester City's victory went from 2 to 0 in the match at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England last Saturday.
Aguero scored a goal at 65 minutes in a game that seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentinian front got a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He left quickly between three Brighton's defenses, scratching with what he was walking through the field of play.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He ran a defense before he passed a few more on the edge of Brighton's area.
Then he made a passage to his left that he found Sterling.
The English front turned the pilot back to the first touch, inside the area, in Aguero, who with his right leg beat the porter of Brighton, Mathew Ryan, with a jute that stuck inside the net on the right side.
"Aguero has trouble standing," Pep Guardiola, city coach, told reporters.
"We have decided that I would play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are fortunate that I have marked a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the fight for the First League.
His goal came at 29 a.m.
In that game, Aguero got the pilot deep in Brighton's field and
He made a beautiful passage into space for the left-hand side to Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the pilot before passing her to Sterling in the long suit.
Sky Blues front ended the pilot inside the network before he left the background line.
The city faces at the Hoppenheim on Tuesday, beginning at 18:55 p.m., at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, no options, wants to remove the Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the fight for the play-off, there were no many reasons to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to get out at the launcher's mount Sunday that he's coming against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who are holding an advantage party on Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western League, have the opportunity to play the playoff.
The Rockies made sure a comedy with the victory for 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still seek to get their first division title.
"Although we don't play anything, we can at least go out to launch knowing the environment here in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably argue every point at the highest level, as no one has done this year.
Why would I want to lose this game?"
The Nationals still have to announce an open launcher for Sunday, but they're apparently determined to let Scherzer fly if this is given.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, made a hot session on Thursday and would launch Sunday, on his usual day of rest.
Washington's right-hand launcher has a record of 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump meets in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke about the importance of Republicans' participation in half-term elections.
"All we've done is in November.
Five weeks are missing for one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big, I don't present myself, but actually I do, so I'm everywhere fighting for the fantastic candidates," he said.
Trump went on, "You can see this horrible, horrible group of democrats, it's happening right now.
They're determined to regain power for all necessary means, see their maschines, their evil intentions.
They don't care who they hurt, about who they have to pass to get power and control, that's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them."
The democratic mission, he said, is "to resist and obstruct".
"And this can be seen in the last four days," he retorted, and titled the democracies of "unjust, ugly, dirty and false".
Trump referred to Diane Feinstein, the highest democratic senator of the Senate Judicial Committee, as a result of which he provoked a strong public vote.
"Remember your answer?
Did you filter the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait a minute... that was a very bad body language expression, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party has stopped being a different party.
It's intolerant to those who say what they think.
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to censor me, I was not surprised.
Finally, I am the last of a series of British parliamentarians to whom we have been told that we are not welcome, all to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because he was determined against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the censorship motion, I was criticized for discriminating with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, and ironically, are similar issues in respect of which Jeremy disagrees with previous leaders.
In the wake of the Nottingham Labour Party's Friday meeting, it was announced that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During most of my eight years as a local parliamentarian, the meetings of the General Committee on Friday night have been exactly that way.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and a long time ago the promise of "more generous and kind" politicians has been forgotten if it ever existed.
It is increasingly evident that divergent opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable for the party's direction.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, since colleagues with whom he had previously thought that he shared a political vision seemed to expect me to turn 180th and take positions that I would never have adopted, either on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public, say what I say, social networks are filled with aggressive messages in which a call is made to keep my candidacy from being renewed, central politics are being denounced and I'm told it shouldn't be at the Labor Party.
And that's not just me.
In fact, I know that I have more luck than some of my colleagues, because the messages I get are usually political.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues that every day have to face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks, and they don't run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're no longer that different party, and with each motion of "untrustworthy" or each change in the selection rules, the party was more inclined.
In the last two years, I have received a lot of advice and I have been advised to keep my head down, that it was not so expressive and that it would “all go well.”
But I didn't get into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my time of study, inspired by thatcher's negligent government, who left my entire class literally inundated, I've tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, either as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have any doubt about my political positions and the points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who promoted the Friday movement, I would say that at a time when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will harm homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labor Party.
But, in fact, the message I want to convey did not lead to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are laborers or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of renewal of my candidacy or any political interest will prevent me from acting, in my opinion, for the sake of the interests of all of you.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose: One father beats the leader
Two last-hour tests distorted the final outcome, but there is no doubt that the Ayrs deserved victory in this vibrant party of the Tenning's Premiership Day.
The Ayrs, who are the only intruded team of ten, occupy the first position on the classification table.
In the end, the local team was imposed thanks to its defensive superiority and the fact that it knew to take better advantage of the opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be satisfied.
"The parties we've played so far have tested us and we're still being beaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said: "Glorious for the Ayrs, they have taken advantage of the better opportunities than we have."
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, placed before the Ayrs, but a yellow card for the international Scottish Rory Hughes, handed over by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical superiority and Jason Baggot noted an unconverted attempt.
Climo expanded the Ayr's advantage with a penalty and, just in the middle of it, he ascribed and converted an attempt to put the 17-5 marker in favour of the Ayrs at rest.
But the Melrose began well the second part and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
Then the party was interrupted for a long time because of the serious injury that Ruarid Knott suffered, which he withdrew into a literacy, and in the repression the Ayrs again extended the distance with a trial of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Then the full captain Blair Macpherson was shown with a yellow card and again the Melrose took advantage of the superiority of another man with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of intense pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card to make a pilot-free landing in Climo, since the sanctions alignment, MacPherson noted a counter-test behind the ayrs.
Climo marked, as he had done almost again since the repression, after Kyle Rowe picked up a suit from David Armstrong and passed the pilot on the third line to Gregor Henry to note the fifth attempt of the local team.
The Still Game series star appears to be ready to start a new career in the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, seems to be ready to go to the hospitality sector after it has been discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis's character in the BBC's popular series, which writes and co-portagonizes with Greg Hemhill, his comic partner for a long time.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the director of Arogingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this, although a source of the Scottish Sun newspaper pointed out that Kiernan intended to enter the "florent restoration sector" of Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, without coast, hopes that the court will reopen the road to the Pacific
The sailors patrol their ship covered in La Paz.
Public buildings ring a sea blue flag.
The bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are jammed with the slogan: "The sea is our right.
It's a duty to recover it."
Beyond Bolivia's landless territory, the memory of a lost coast in front of Chile in a conflict of cruel resources in the 19th century remains very vivid, as is the desire to sail back into the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia expects the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, no need to say, wait with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at TIJ's resolution in large screens across the country, with the hope that the Hague Tribunal will issue in support of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign exit to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, facing a controversial battle for the next year's reelection, also has many hopes deposited in the Monday resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised last August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court will decide in favour of Bolivia and that, if it did, things would not change much.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no authority to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of the possible conversations.
The TIJ resolution, which takes place only six months after the submission of the final allegations, indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from being favored, Bolivia's cause may have experienced a relapse in the last four years.
"The current Bolivian administration has undermined the issue of access to the sea," Zárate pointed out.
"The blasphemous rhetoric of Morales has undermined any gesture of good will on the part of Chile," he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep conversations after this episode.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was exceptionally rapid.
The next Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of discrimination, with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political cross.
"Bolivia will never give up on its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The resolution is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not take place unless it can rely on the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons unless he can trust Washington.
Nothing spoke last Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
The minister urged the United States to keep the promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His statements arrive at a time when the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, appears to be about to resume nuclear diplomacy that was stopped more than three months after the summit held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong One.
Ri says it's a queer to think that the US's continued sanctions and objections to a declaration that could end the Korean War can make North Korea never get in the way.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement if Pyongyang does not make any major disarmament movements.
Both Kim and North American president Donald Trump want to celebrate a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about the fact that Pyongyang takes the matter seriously to give up an arsenal that the country considers to be the only means of guaranteeing its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
The fashion parades in Paris reveal the latest range of large-scale hats, from the road to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or you want to protect yourself completely from the sun, you don't need to look any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented to the passel a range of disproportionate decks of disproportionate dimensions of their SS19 collection, which extended the style defined in the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer Instagram has been torn down by very few practical bars, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the passageway.
Valentino's outstanding piece was an exaggerated bee hat, decorated with a wide wing, in the form of lead, that flooded the head of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were enchanted syndromes, a witch hat and even a pine, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of extrafollar masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, of live colors, had boiled lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than not high sewing.
One creation looked like a complete team of submarines, with tubes and glasses, while another looked like a cone of ice.
And if you follow the big fashion trends, you're lucky.
Style observers predict that huge hats could be placed in the main streets near you.
The large-scale hats shake the tops of "the Bomb", a ball hat, with a two-foot wide coat that everyone has brought, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the hat so little practical that it spread through the social networks brought another great creation to the passageway: a ball bag for the beach, almost as big as the model dressed in bathrobe that it wore.
The raffle bag, dark orange, decorated with raffle locks and finished with a white leather nose, was the outstanding piece of the collection La Riviera SS19 of Jacquesmus in the Week of Paris Fashion.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see people bringing big bars and beach bags to the main streets in the next summer. Considering that the designer has had a great impact, it would be a shame to ignore the demand for large-scale accessories.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a course of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is enhanced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Independent Schools Council (SCIS), are working to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for higher and higher education, for the career they choose, and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a very popular and desirable matter of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, you'll get to his head.
If you speak it in your own language, you will reach your heart."
This is a very important reminder that we cannot depend only on English if we want to establish relationships and generate trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of the exams, we can see that the languages lead the classification tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained the upper A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools reflected that 72% of students received a higher qualification in mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students, and 63% of Spanish students also received an A.
This shows that Scotland's independent schools support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as an election assignment, are kept in the same consideration as STEM assignments (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey carried out by the UK Employment and Competence Commission revealed that for reasons given by employers to cover their vacancies, 17% were attributed to lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly needed to prepare young people for their future careers.
Since there is more and more potential job opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the race that a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with permanent competence like this.
The fact that you can communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in front of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov among over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
So investing in language learning is important for today's children.
Knowing a number of languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children the best opportunity to find an important job.
In Scotland there is diversity between schools about the languages they learn.
Some schools focus more on more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important to the United Kingdom in the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your son's interest, he will always be able to choose between a number of languages in independent schools, which include specialized teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the necessary skills to be successful, regardless of what the future may be.
In the global trading environment of the present time, language cannot be denied that languages remain vital for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered 'international communications competences'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young Scottish people.
It needs to be done well.

LeBron will begin with the Lakers in San Diego Sunday
Hope has practically ended for fans who want to see LeBron James playing their first game with Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the first pre-season match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But you still have to determine the minutes you'll play.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton at the lakers' official location.
Mike Trudell, a Laker journalist, tweeted that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After the early training this week, James was asked about his plans for the calendar of six Lakers' pre-temporary parties.
"I don't need pre-temporary parties at this stage of my career to be ready," he rebuffed.
Trump Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a wave of campaign acts tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first five scheduled meetings for next week, including visits to sympathetic sites, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his candidate to cover the Supreme Court vacancy is pending, Trump intends to get support for the next half-term elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can it be seen online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. on Saturday 29 September 2018.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia can be seen online on the link specified below, via live video transmission for YouTube.
Trump is probably interrupting this week's hearing with the candidate appointed to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense about the allegations of sexual abuse he was facing, while the Senate's pre-confirmation vote remained pending until one week and the FBI investigated the case.
But the main objective of this wave of meetings is to help Republicans present in the delicate November elections to collect momentum.
Therefore, the five meetings of President Trump's campaign scheduled for next week are directed to "stimulate volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"Congres control is so important for its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, while we are heading towards a busy campaign season," a Trump spokesman pointed out, according to Reuters, who refused to be identified.
Tonight's meeting, scheduled at the Wesbanko Arena, Wheeling, could bring together supporters "from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the coverage of the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavorable results in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to give him a boost in the polls," commented Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: the North American team shows its ambition to keep the hope alive for the individual Sunday parties
After three uneven sessions, Saturday afternoon fursoms were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The basculent pendulum of dynamics is an invented sport concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this one.
So on which side is the positive dynamic now?
"They have an advantage of six points and now it's four, so I think we're in a little positive direction," said Jordan Spieth as he left at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has an advantage, four points forward, with twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind bubbling a little in their favor and have many reasons to be animated, largely by the state of Spielth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tea to green and is giving examples.
The humour screams of celebration rose from intensity as he continued his turn and became a crucial bitch to implode the fourth party, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the whore that made them win the party in hole 15 with a similar cry, indicating that he believes the American team is not yet out of competition.
"You have to make the most of it and worry about your own party," Spieth pointed out.
It's all that's left of these players now.
18 holes to leave print.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unquestionable feeling of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four or four and do not make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a crazy Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the crazy Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last new holes Friday morning.
As a result, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from public bubbles, it is reaffirmed that it is the players on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun is on Le Golf National.
Better both at the same time in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's furballs, who married Alex Noren.
One crazy and two doubles in the first nine holes poured Spanish and Swiss into a hole they never had any choice to get out of.
Sunday, but there's no one who can help you get out of the hole.
The furballs and fursoms are very fascinating to see for the interactions between the apparatus, the advice that they give and the advice that they don't give, and the way a strategy can change over and over again.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this forum session has shown that the US team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, have questioned.
Europe arrives at the end of Ryder Cup with a 10-6 marker
Europe will face the last day of Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after finishing the fourballs and Saturday foursomes with a 10 to 6 victory over the United States.
Inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, he made a great effort to win two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficulty and leave his record, until now, at four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, captain of Thomas Bjorn, who was eager to preserve the trophy he lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated a little American team in the morning's furballs and put the series in 3-1.
The US presented more resistance to the forums and won two parties, but they could not reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to get eight points on Sunday's 12 individual games to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debuter to achieve four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known as Molliwood after a sensational weekend, are only the second couple to win four points in their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed at the fourballs, they staged a brilliant performance to beat a Woods deflate and American debuter Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had been dragged into two parties on Saturday, showed sporadic sparks of genius, but lost 19 of 29 matches in furballs and fursomes, and seven consecutives.
Justin Rose, who didn't participate in the morning's football, remarried with Henrik Stenson at the forums and fell by 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, classified as the first and third of the world, respectively.
However, Europe did not have everything on its face on a pleasant and windy day in southwestern Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three times the tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set up a reference point for the Americans on Saturday, reaching two points.
They won a victory with determination for 2 to 1 against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter at the fourballs and later again won Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4 to 3 in the foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's story a team had raised a difference of four points to individual parties, although Furyk's team, a champion of title, just needs to empattate to keep it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a contraction Sunday is coming out of its scope.
North Korea declares it will not be unilaterally disarmed "in any way" if trust signs are not appreciated
North Korean Foreign Minister announced on Saturday to the United Nations that the continued sanctions were intensifying his confidence in the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the Annual General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea had taken "significant good-will measures" during the previous year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missiles, disarming the nuclear testing centre and committing itself not to proliferation nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we don't notice any response to the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not start disarmament unilaterally."
If Ri resumed the well-known North Korea complaints about Washington's resistance to a phase-by-step denuclearization approach that would reward North Korea as it gradually took action, his statements seemed significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had already done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement that Kim Jong One and Donald Trump made at the first summit between a US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, in which Kim committed to working on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised safeguards for North Korea's security.
North Korea has attempted to formally put an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has announced that Pyongyang must first eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists that denuclearisation must be done first and increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, in addition to opposing the "war-end declaration," Ri pointed out.
"The perception that sanctions will make us kneel down is a camera of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are intensifying our distrust."
Ri did not refer to plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump that US leader highlighted in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the part involved in the issue of denuclearization was South Korea rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this stagnation."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from what he kept last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly to point to the US territory with North Korean missiles it was inevitable after President "Mr. Evil" Trump titled Kim "Rocket Man" on a suicide mission.
Now in the United Nations, Trump, which last year threatened to "destruct completely" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but demonstrated that there is still much to do and that sanctions must be maintained until North Korea is denuclearized.
Last Wednesday, Trump said there was no time for this and that “it doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years, or five months. ”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday to the UN Security Council that: "The application of the Security Council sanctions must continue energetically and without exception until we confirm total and definitive denuclearisation."
The Security Council has unanimously launched sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in a bid to cut the financing of Pyongyang ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and then reported that he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeii has already visited North Korea three times this year, but her last trip didn't go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but in just a few hours North Korea accused him of making "own requests for a gangster".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to dismantle a missile centre and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "consonance measures".
He said Kim had informed him that the "consonance measures" he was seeking were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on rest habits
Now, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat culture, increasingly extensive, to study throughout the night, stimulated by the caffeine.
One scholar observed that students at the number - or - number university in the world are often upset about the basic aspects of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Sound Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his species in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after talking about the impact that sleep deprivation had on learning.
"At the end of the talk, a girl approached me and said, "Why are they telling me all this in my last year?"
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of the sound, which surprised me," The Telegraph reported.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, students are told basic concepts about how good sound habits improve academic and sports performance, in addition to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health services, said that the University decided to introduce the course after he learned that some students had severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course, from an hour of duration, includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there's an image of a bedroom, where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, bamboos and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how sports performance affects the lack of sound, and about the importance of keeping a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Next, a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
"We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the effects of smoking cigarettes for health," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride to stay awake all night still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and growing pressure that students suffer make sound deprivation a growing problem.
Making sure to enjoy a sound of good quality for a long time should be a "secret weapon" of the students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, added, even to avoid weight gain, as the loss of the sound puts the brain in an initial way and makes the students always want.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiar who studies Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Cheisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and had inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he expects, is to ask postgraduate students to carry out a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students take into account the fact that they have an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light that emit the electronic displays and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause noise problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with men from Gerard
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disarmed team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingstone's house, which is supposed to be another suffocating outside.
Ibrox's team was trying to add their first victory to their home from the February 4th to 1st in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team attacked Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach to leave his team in the drift, at 8 points of the Hearts, unparalleled leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before half, and it never seemed as if the Rangers, lacking inspiration, were about to equal the marker.
While Rangers now fall in the sixth square, Livingston stands in the third position, behind the Hibernian, unlike goals.
And the Rangers could face more difficulties later, as the Calum Spence line judge needed medical attention for a head wound caused by an object that was apparently released from the grace.
Gerard made eight changes in respect of the alignment that swept the Ayrs into the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same eleven headlines that he set up a point against the Hearts last week. He probably felt satisfied by the way his team, well organized, suffocated their rivals at all times.
Although the Rangers dominated possession, Livingstone created more danger when they had the pilot.
In fact, they should have marked in the two minutes of the match, when Menga's first intervention left Scott Pittman alone in front of Alan McGregor, but the migampist turned away and took advantage of the great opportunity.
A missive release by Keaghan Jacobs met with Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow only made a court turned upside down.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more hope than they believed in their game at the end of the third.
Alfred Morelos really believed he should have had a penalty on the five-minute signal, as he and Steven Lawless met, but Albert Steven Thomson ignored Colombian claims.
The Rangers only led two judges to port the first part, but the first porter of the Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had no problem with the head of Lassana Coulibally and the doctor in front of Ovie Ejaria.
While the first act of the Livi in 34 minutes could have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it only because of their efforts.
Again, the Rangers couldn't cope with Jacobs' work.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the pilot to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to choose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard acted on the break when he changed Coulibally for Ryan Kent, and the change had an immediate impact, as the extreme made a transition to Morelos, even though the imposing Kelly ran into the lockdown.
However, the Livingstons continued to capture the attention of visitors playing exactly as they liked, with Lithgov and Halkett making long walks, one behind the other.
Holt's band could have given direction to the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow did a wrong from the cornet.
The Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton still asked for a final penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but Thomson again made his eyes big.
German: Count Geiger's Inventory
And now a page of Sunday Morning German: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that finally gave rise to the device we know as Geiger Count.
Count Geiger, who has been a pillar of science since then, has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starred by Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, a seemingly failed vampire physicist:
Home: "What's in it?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger count, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earpieces on, you can hear the effects of atoms that emanate from radioactive activity on minerals."
Evans: "I'm sure he's breaking up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd anniversary.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and remove malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of a patient's immune cells and altering them in the laboratory.
You can "see" a common protein in many cancers and then reinject them
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different types of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw the ovary cancer that she suffered for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of a patient's immune cells, altering them in the laboratory to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and then injecting them again.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland (U.S.A.): "The results we have obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine."
HER2 protein " favours the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach is to extract the patient's immune cells and "teaching" these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West got pregnant on a pro-Trump diatrotype with a MAGA cap after his performance in the SNL program.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was written in the study during the Saturday Night Live program after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated US President Donald Trump, and said he would be presented in the 2020 elections.
After his third night song, entitled Ghost Town, in which he wore a cover of Make America Great Again, began criticizing the Democrats and repeating their support in Trump.
"Every time I talk to white people, they say, how can you like Trump if he's a racist?
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's witness in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee for sexual assault allegations filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't issued, the eater Chris Rock picked up the recording of West's disapproval on social networks.
It wasn't clear if Rock intended to ridicule the West with the publication.
However, the West complained to the public that it was not well dealt with among the builders because of the hat it wore.
"They threatened me among the builders.
They told me you didn't go out with that hat on.
I'm being harassed.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
The West continued, "Do you want to see the lower position?" while he said that he would put Superman's coat on, so he couldn't tell him what to do. "Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comments caused the audience to write at least twice, and the members of the program team seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, who had a reporter who explained in the publication: "The whole study remained completely mute."
West took as a substitute for the last hour of Ariana Grande, the ex of which, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West left a good part of the audience with the interpretation of song I Love it, decorated with Perrier's bottle.
West got the support of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted, "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for being among the crowd."
But the chairman of the debate program, Karen Hunter, tweeted that the West was just "being who it is and that it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I have chosen not to reward anyone (including his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I think adopts and proclaims an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
And so do we," he added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had changed and that it was now "to be once known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague, Snoop Dogg, used to be Snoop Lion, and the missing legend of Prince music changed his name for a symbol and, later, the artist previously known as Prince.
Probation of attempted murder at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man's assault on Friday in East Belfast.
According to the police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the court of Belfast's first instance on Monday.
The prosecutor will check the charges.
The Throne Game star, Kit Harington, denounces a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known to represent the role of Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the virile hero stereotype, claiming that these papers suggest that young boys often believe they have to be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something had gone wrong" and that he wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married the 31-year-old Cortagonist, Rose Leslie, has admitted that she is determined to deal with this problem.
"Personally, now I wonder where we have been wrong about masculinity," he says.
"What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we now experience?"
According to Kit, television can share responsibility for increasing toxic masculinity thanks to its so-called virile characters.
He added, "What's innate and what's acquired?
What is taught on television and on the streets that young boys feel they have to have this facet of virility?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
'Cause there's no doubt something wrong with young boys.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do any prequel or sequel throne game when the end of the series is scheduled for the next summer, saying he's made battles and horses.
As of November, Kit will play a role in the work of the True West of Sam Shepard, which explains the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know his partner Rose is the best game he's ever had.
"I met my wife in the series, so she gave me my future family and my life ahead," she said.
Rose made Ygritte's paper, the love of the character that Kit, Jon Snow, represented in an Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase in new cases of 14%
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health officials.
Only the second quarter of 2018 reported 40,000 new cases.
The vast majority of new cases are sexual transmission, unlike what happened in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China due to blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who oppose HIV for this cause has fallen almost zero, according to Chinese health officials' statements at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality broke out in China in 1997, but discrimination in the LGBT collective is common.
In view of the country's conservative values, studies believe that between 70 and 90 percent of men who maintain homosexual relations will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to lack of adequate precautions for sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has filtered data from senators of the Republican Party and demounts "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. representative Maxine Waters reported on Saturday's charges that a member of his staff had published personal information from three United States senators on the sites of Wikipedia's legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that their requests were driven by criticism and extreme right-wing websites.
"Little lies, lies, and more reprehensible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Apparently, the information published contained the addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, and it was published by someone unknown in the Capitol during a session of the Senate commission on sexual abuse complaints against the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was filtered after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was related to the Waters office and that it revealed the information of a Waters staff member, reported the Capitol.
"This baseless complaint is completely false and a pure lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff, the identity, the personal data and the security of which have been compromised because of these false and fraudulent complaints, was not responsible in any way for this information filtering.
This baseless complaint is completely false and a pure invention."
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism, including that of the press secretary of the White House, Ari Flescher.
"This denial is full of indignation," Flescher wrote.
"That makes you think you don't have the temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be a challenge.
You don't have to question the defendant's motives.
You must keep calm and calm."
Flescher seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, to whom critics accused themselves of looking too angry during the Thursday session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was present to overthrow Waters in the mid-legislative elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Importing if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had warned the relevant authorities and security forces of these fraudulent statements.
"We will make sure that the criminals are revealed, continued, "and that they will be legally held responsible for all the actions that have been carried out and that they have damaged all and every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Criticism Again: limited spy parody of Rowan Atkinson
It is already a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British focus, and this reposition of Johnny English's action-comedy parody, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, not an exception.
This humorous self-satisfaction about how we're inferior will be a new export opportunity in the country?
In any case, the out-of-the-eye and rubber-faced Johnny English has been able to renew his license for the second time to twist it all. His name indicates more than anything else that is a comical creation designed for non-English speaking territories with tradition of going to cinema.
Of course, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquefied glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a point of Mr. Bean and a touch of this guy who brings a single note to the topic of Fire Carrie at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games 2012.
Originally, it was based on the international and mysterious traveler Atkinson, who now represented Barclaycard's forgotten TV ads, where he was sowing chaos all over the world.
There are one or two good times on this last J.E. journey.
I loved Johnny English coming up to a helicopter dressed in a medieval armored suit, and the helical sheets were repeating it in the helmet.
You see the gift Atkinson has for the physical comedy, but the humor seems quite fluid and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious" cinematographic brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now include comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be intended for children more than adults, and for me, Johnny English's absurd adventures are not as ingenious or focused as the dumb gags of Mr. Bean's character representing Atkinson.
The repeatedly topical assumption now is that Britain is in serious problems.
A computer pirate has infiltrated the British super-secret web spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, causing the consternation of the service agent, a paper sadly small to Kevin Eldon.
It's the last resource for a prime minister who's a pretentious and obsessed figure, who already suffers a total collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of her own with this pessimistic character from Teresa-May, but the script doesn't reach any more.
Their intelligence advisors inform you that as each active spy is in danger, it will have to recover some of its retirement.
And this includes the illustrative Johnny English, now employed as a teacher in some luxury institution, but by teaching extra-official classes about how to become a covered agent, with some good gags, like now that English offers a spying academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his sequencing sufferer Bow, a paper that re-presents Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic paper, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little dissatisfaction.
Thus, Batman and Robin from when things get very light in the secret service of His Majesty enter into action once again and find Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "fatal woman" Ophelia Bulletin.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the charm of the technological billionaire charismatic who claims that he can solve the computer problems of Britain: the late Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their hate of ridiculous madness: dressed in rooms, they fire a French fast-food restaurant, they sow chaos by smuggling along Volta's luxury iota and English causes a great confusion in trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops have certainly been pulled out of this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise that it presents, everything looks like a child program.
Pretty normal stuff.
Like the other Johnny English films, it has not been helpful to think about whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a paper that does justice to its talent.
The Labour Party denies that it's the idea of a plan for British people to have a four-day work week and cover five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan that the British will work four days a week and charge five.
The party, of course, wants the heads of companies to pass the savings obtained by the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to the workers by giving them a more party day.
The employees would enjoy a weekend of three days, but they would get the same pay.
According to sources, the idea would fit the party's economic agenda and plans to attract the country in favor of workers.
The change to a week works for four days with the support of the trade union confederation Trades Union Congress as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experienced source of the Labour Party stated to The Sunday Times: "It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
It won't be the night, but a four-day work week is a ambition that fits the party's perspective of balancing the economy in favour of the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this ambition jointly at present.
According to a spokesperson of the Labour Party: "A four-day work week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it."
The minister in the shadow of John McDonnell used the party's conference last week to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" to public service companies.
The Minister's plans in the shadow also imply that water company shareholders could not recover all the investment, as the labor government could apply "deductions" for the crimes it perceives.
It has also confirmed plans to place workers together in companies and create own funds included to deliver 10% of the shares of private sector firms to employees, who expect to raise annual dividends for up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, explains in "60 minutes" if the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could change their opinion.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote of his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and has raised the question as to whether the Agency's findings could influence any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview that will be published on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring out something that made them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Speak it seriously," said Kennedy.
"At the session I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when everything happened and the charges were made public, and I asked him if he had done it.
He was firm, determined and sure."
But Graham's vote seems to be on fire.
"I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and I would have an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett rejected it round," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people I name will be able to verify it.
She's 36 years old.
I can't see anything changes again."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did anything to reduce poverty?
New York will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event, which presents an absolutely impressive star programme, which will complete an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
In the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people meeting in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken awareness of the global objective of the event of ending extreme poverty in the world before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international defence group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help to combat it actively.
To receive a free entry for the event (as someone wants to pay for a VIP entry), assistants had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a telephone call or any other activity to raise awareness of the purpose of ending poverty.
What success has Global Citizens now spent 12 years on reaching their goal?
The idea of awarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call for action or just another case of what we call "clitivism" (people who think it marks the difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have registered more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, who have helped to achieve several objectives.
It states that these actions have helped to stimulate global leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to over $37,000 million, which would have affected the lives of more than 2,250 million people before 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements derived from its shares, of which 10,000 million USD have already been disbursed or recovered at least.
The group estimates that the protected funds have now had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the The Power of Nutrition Foundation, an association of investors and realists with them in the United Kingdom, which undertakes to "help children grow as much as possible" and promises to send 35 million USD to Rwanda to help combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"Thanks to the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn social injustice of malnutrition into a bit of a page of history," said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions requesting the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+Fs on his website, he asked, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied, "It'll be a long and hard path, sometimes we fall and fail.
But as the great defence movements of civil rights and against previous apartheid, we will triumph, because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will act on the upcoming New York event that will present Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "block" to obstruct Russian energy exports (secretary of the Interior)
Washington may, "if necessary", use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting the markets, including those in the Middle East, has revealed the US Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner quoted it.
Zinke has claimed that Russia's intervention in Syria, mainly where it operates with the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they already do in Eastern Europe, the southern bank of Europe," he reportedly said.
According to the officer, there are ways and means to deal with this issue.
"The United States has the capacity, together with the Navy, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, for blocking, to prevent its energy entering the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the assistants to the event celebrated by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is self-defined as "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and he pointed out that they are actually equal.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia consists, more or less, of taking advantage of and replacing fuels," he said, while pointing out that Russia has only one resource, as its economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements come while Trump administration has been on a mission to stimulate the export of its natural gas liquid to Europe, in place of Russia, the most economic option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's administration officers, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to leave the North Stream 2 "unadequate" project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into a Moscow "captiu".
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which has cost $11,000 million and will double the gas pipeline capacity of 110,000 million cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of disloyal competence.
I think we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers, Russia's Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The position of the US has led to a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organisation of the German industry, FDI, has called on the US to separate EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said "will think carefully" his candidacy for the presidency in 2020.
Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren stated on Saturday that he would "think carefully" his candidacy for the presidency after the mid-legislative elections.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix the government's fracture, for women to take on high responsibilities," The Hill said.
"After November 6, I will take my presidential candidacy seriously."
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and said that "he was bringing the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy," he said.
Warren has been frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said, "Of course, I need an FBI investigation before the elections."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters believed that they should not be presented for 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not be present, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The investigation revealed a broader support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent in favour of a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other high profile names among the Democrats that were taken into account in connection with a possible candidate for 2020 include Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd officially reveal his decision on gender, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cites the affection for TEPT Track Palin at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after being listed on September 11, 2007
Monday night he was arrested and charged with domestic violence
"With what's happening to my own son since he came back, I can understand other families that suffer branchings of TPT and some of the emotional wounds our soldiers are returning with," explained the audience at a meeting of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the next of his son and other war veterans, "they're back a little different, they're back on their feet, they're tired, they're back wondering if there's respect for what their soldiers and pilots, as well as any other army member, have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and is charged with domestic violence against a woman, with a statement of domestic violence and armed violence under the effects of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, you brought the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eight states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge of a new US policy that rejects asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
Representatives of 18 states and the district introduced a friend of mine to Washington on Friday to support an asylum-seeker who challenged politics, according to NBC News.
The full name of Grace vs Sessions request that the American Union for Civil Liberties presented the month of August against federal politics has not been revealed.
He said his partner "and the children of the member of the violent band" attacked her, but the North American officials refused her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
States' advocates supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum-seekers are generated in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Colombia, Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
Federal laws require asylum applications to be awarded according to the facts and particular circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the friend caree.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy that denies immigrants' entry is damaging the economy of the United States, as it is more likely that they become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary jobs".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country for persecution or fear of racial, religious, nationality or belonging to a social group or a concrete political opinion," Sessions said in their June 11 announcement of this policy.
The asylum never meant to ease all the problems, not even the worst, people are facing every day around the world.
Rescue efforts desperate in Palu as human losses multiply in a sprinkling to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma while calming her son with fever in an evacuation center in the city of Palu destroyed.
"Every minute, an ambulance brings bodies.
There's no drinking water."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes to take up the flood of ownership and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of injuries, and the hospitals, unfavourable by magnitude 7.5, are saturated.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Harris, who broke the shoulder, are out of Palu's military hospital, as the patients are being treated outside because of the strong bags that are being repeated.
The tears denied his eyes as he explained how the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
"I heard my wife asking for help crying and then I didn't hear her any more.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. Ambassador charges China with "advertising announcements".
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page ad in a North American newspaper promoting the mutual advantages of trade between the US and China, US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the North American press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed China's Daily payment supplement to The Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of being involved in the U.S. Congress elections of November 6, China denied.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to implicate itself in the U.S. elections marked what North American officials have explained to Reuters that it is a new phase of Washington's campaign to intensify pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to include ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently being framed in a trade war that is intensifying and which has seen the oranges pressed into mutual imports.
China's vengeful tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were aimed at punishing state exporters, such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and North American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for a long time, an important exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing had damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article in The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It is redoubled by advertising advertising in our free press."
"In publishing its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the estimated North American tradition of freedom of expression and free press to include a payment ad in The Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In exchange, in the kiosk that is down here in Beijing, you will find few dissatisfaction voices and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate views that Chinese citizens can have on China's worrying economic path, since the media are dominated by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers was the offer to publish" his article, but he didn't say the name of the publication.
Republicans separate women's voters before mid-legislative elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
Since many of the major Republicans support and defend the candidate in the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, which faces several requests for sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, in the next mid-legislative elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high, and most Republicans are already officially showing that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things can't be undone," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political sciences at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, in The Hill for an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last hour's pressure to complete an FBI investigation is enough to calm the angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday, neither tomorrow nor November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national spokesman of the Progressive Group MoveOn, on Friday, according to Washington's newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protestors called "November is coming!" (November approaching) as they appeared in the Senate lobby while the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee decided to continue with the appointment of Kavanaugh despite the witness of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will remain out of the chart," explained Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
"People say they've already been tall; it's true.
But it could have been more, especially among the voters of sub-urban women and younger voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who often do not vote until they like the president."
Even before the Ford's public witness, where he detailed his sexual assault applications to the candidate in the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a negative response could be made if the Republicans were to press confirmation.
"This has become an embolism for the GOP," said Michael Steele, president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just the vote of the board or the final vote, nor if Kavanaugh sits in the bank of the defendants, it's also about how the Republicans handled this issue and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, the U.S. Priorities Director, a group that helps to elect Democrats, in the news channel.
However, the North Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in Ford's star and Kavanaugh's witnesses, with the balance that is slightly down to the last.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the polls believe in an unquestionable or probable way in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent claim to believe in an unquestionable or probable way Kavanaugh.
Also, about 38 percent said that he believed that Kavanaugh had probably lied or doubted during his testimony, while about 30 percent claimed the same for Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating requests filed by Ford and at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the effects of alcohol when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez complains that the candidate in the Supreme Court taught the genitals at a party while studying in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web is launching a new company that plans to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company based on the open code platform Solid de Berners-Lee.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention of Inrupt was "dominating the world".
"We have to do it now," said the company emerging.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal data store" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They're all available in a browser at the same time.
What's exclusive of the online personal data store is that the user is the one who decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is that the company integrates adequate resources, processes and capabilities because the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some template developers contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications through the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said none of his team is talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely empty during the night.
"We're not asking permission."
In a Saturday publication in the Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website integrated into the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Even during the launch of the Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new web era," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Clergy of the I GM Victory Cross
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won a Victory Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Lieutenant Bernard Vann obtained the guard on September 29, 1918 for the attack on Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was beaten by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had won the most important British military honor.
His two grandchildren evicted a memorial stone on a Saturday parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the stone was presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's guardianship.
According to The London Gazette, September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a very thick noise and under the intense fire of canons and machine guns".
Later he ran to the line of fire and, with the "maximum courage," made the row move before he threw himself over a cannon with one hand and left three members of the stand.
Lieutenant Colonel was beaten by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said his grandfather's actions were a proselyte that could never equalize, which produces a sense of humility for you.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the show and added that the value of an authentic hero is demonstrated by support that he will receive from many people.
MMA fans who stayed out of sleep all night to see Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine that you're awake all night to see Bellator 206 and you're told to see the most important event.
San José's cartel contained 13 matches, including six of the main card and had to be seen live all night in the United Kingdom at Channel 5.
At 6:00, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, the viewers of the United Kingdom became impressed when the program changed Pappa Pig.
Some were disgusted with having spent the night awake until the morning before seeing the struggle.
A Twitter follower described the change in animated drawings as "a type of vomitive acuity."
"The government's legislation says that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so they changed to child programming," said Dave Schwartz, Vice President of Marketing and Bellator's Communication, when asked about retransmission.
"Pipa la cotta, yes."
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they would work on the programming to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think of the repetition, I think it can work," said Coker.
"But there are six in the morning of a Sunday and we can't solve it until Sunday at our time, Monday at yours.
But we're working there.
Believe me, when I changed channel, there were many messages that went and came, and not all of them were nice.
We were trying to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen again.
We'll leave it in five fights, instead of six as we normally do, we tried to show it again by the followers, but it ended.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "low" about sexuality
Olympic Jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest of the people because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to triumph.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
In the Desert Island Radio 4 Discs program presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also said that being a father had remained important to him in winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months to get sick.
Daley, who appeared as a sailor at Laverne's first program, said he felt "less than" the others because "it wasn't socially acceptable as children and girls."
He said, "Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference have been real things that have given me power and strength to triumph."
I wanted to prove it was "something," he said, so that no one would be disappointed when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The two-time winner of the Olympic bronze medal has become a high profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image of the Commonwealth Games of May in Australia to ask more countries to describe homosexuality.
He said that he had spoken because he was happy to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give hope to others.
The world's trim champion explained that he had fallen in love with a man, the North American realist Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "he caught me by surprise."
Last year, Daley married the winner of an Oscar, 20 years older than he was, but he says the age difference was never a problem.
According to him, when you’re young, it’s hard to find someone of the same age who’s experienced high and low levels of cancer when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later.
The couple were parents to the June of a child who named Robert Ray Black-Daley, according to Daley, "all his perspective" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold," he said.
"There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is said to be the same as his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 due to brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not agree that he had to die, and one of the last things he asked for was whether they had already entered London in 2012, because he wanted to be on the front line.
"I couldn't tell him, 'stop, you won't be there to take over the first row," he said.
"As he held his hand, he stopped breathing and wasn't even then, he was already dead, which I finally agreed he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew that that was what I had dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home in some Olympic Games. There was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Heather Small Proud), which he had heard during the preparations for the Olympics and was still wearing chicken skin.
Desert Island Disks is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
A worse Mikkelson introduced himself to Ryder Cup on Saturday.
North American Phil Mickelson will beat a record Sunday to play his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to change his physical status if he doesn't want to become an unhappy match.
Mickelson, who will participate in the binary event to record for 12th time, was presented by Captain Jim Furyk for the "fourballs" and "foursomes" modes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of action, as usual for the United States, the top five tournament winner shares his time between making an animator and working in his field game, hoping to correct what hurts him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, not even at the height of his career, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal option for the difficult Le Golf National trajectory, where the long rough habit of punishing the turned-offs.
And if his own trajectory isn't discouraging enough, Mickelson, on Sunday's new game, will face the exact British Open Camp, Francesco Molinari, who joined the Tommy Fleetwood rockie to win the four games this week.
If the North Americans, four points down at the beginning of the 12 individual games, start strong, Mickelson's game could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
"He perfectly understood his role for that day, made me a palm tree on my back and surrounded me with his arm while he told me he would be ready the next day," said Furyk.
"You have a lot of confidence in yourself.
It's a hall of fame and it's brought a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how I trained and that's how we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to be there, like anyone else."
Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record of the maximum number of Ryder Cup games.
It can mean the end of a race at Ryder Cup that didn't equal his individual record.
Mickelson has won 18 victories, 20 defeats and 7 empathies, although Furyk has said his presence has brought untenable to the team.
"It's fun, sarcastic, bromist, he likes to joke about people and he's a big teammate," he explained.
"I think the younger players also had fun staying with him this week, which was fun to see.
Bring much more on the side of your game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows by experience that starting with a considerable advantage the individual dues of Ryder Cup's last day can easily become a hard day.
The Danish started in 1997 in Valderrama, when the team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage on the American team, but in the end they won the minimum victory, 14.5-13.5.
"And keep remembering that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but little by little," said Bjorn, in the picture, after seeing the victory of the 2018 team for 5-3 as late as yesterday, leaving the score in 10-6 in Le Golf National.
The story has taught us to me and all the crew members that are not yet finished.
He's got to go to the whole machine tomorrow.
You have to get out and do everything right.
This doesn't end until the points can't reach the marker.
We have a goal, try to win the trophy, and we have to keep the concentration to do it.
I've already said that, I focus on the 12 players we have on the team, but I also have a view of who our rivals are: the best players in the world."
Delighted with the performance of its players in a demanding golf course, Bjorn added, "I will never rush with this.
It'll be different tomorrow.
Tomorrow's individual performance will mark the difference and change everything.
It's great to be with a friend when it's all right, but individual duels test your ability to play golf.
This is the message you have to deliver to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
At this point, you leave your partner and he has to get out and get the best out of himself."
In opposition to Bjorn, the rival captain, Jim Furyk, expects his players to deliver better individually than on team, with the exception of Jordan Spielth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk knows both faces of the coin on the tops of the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up losing in the "Miracle of Medina" that won Europe.
"I remember all the words," he answered the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to start with a good start, as was seen in Brooklyn and Medina.
When there's a team that's inspired, there's a lot of pressure on these central duels.
We have prepared the alignment according to the circumstances and the best way to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the challenge of attempting to start the rebellion against Rory McIlroy at the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahman, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the remaining Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I have chosen this order because I think it covers all possibilities," says Bjorn about his choice for individual confrontations.
The new warship in Germany, re-positioned
The new German Army fracture would have been completed in 2014 to replace the former warships of the Cold War, but it will not, at least, do so until the year it comes from defective systems and an increase in costs, according to local media.
The completion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which cites a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Army in 2014, but the post-construction problems have marked the deadlines for this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships that the Army commissioned in 2007 will replace the former Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed that it will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-bucs, as well as a technology against furtive actions, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other outstanding features include longer periods between maintenance: it should be possible to use new fractals up to two years without going through national ports.
However, these continued delays imply that the forward-looking ships, which were expected to be able to project in Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete when they enter into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 fracture was already reported last year, when the German Army rejected the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss Drass of Hamburg.
It was the first time the Army returned a ship to the builder once delivered.
There are few details of the reasons why he came back, but the German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that made it inaccessible if used in combat missions.
The technical problems are important, as about 120 sailors, half the crew needed for the former Bremen class breakers, operate on Baden-Württemberg class ships.
In addition, it has also been known that the weight of the ship is excessive, as it reduces its performance and limits the Army's ability to add future improvements to it.
It is believed that the "Rheinland-Pfalz", of 7,000 tons, will weigh twice as many class ships as used by the Germans during the Second World War.
In addition to the defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes crew training, also starts to pose a problem.
It is believed that a surprising amount of EUR 3,100 million ($3,600 million) has arrived from an initial budget of EUR 2,200 million.
The problems of the new fractures have become a matter of special importance, if the recent warnings indicate that the military power of Germany is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, has acknowledged that the Army "is missing ships that can be used".
The officer has said that the situation has worsened over time because they stopped using the old ships, but they were not provided again as replacements.
He lamented that none of Baden-Württemberg's fractures could join the Army.
The National Foundation spys on the secret life of the victims
A new research carried out at a farm in Scotland's Highlands intends to find out how to use the landscape for food.
Discovery is expected to provide new data on the behavior of these only flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study of scientists from the National Scotland Foundation will continue to be soprano and common, as well as northern earring and watering at the Inverewe Botanic Garden, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key property locations to monitor the activities of the bats during the station.
Volunteers and staff of the United Kingdom National Health Service will also carry out mobile surveys with portable detectors.
Analysing the sound of the recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of the hits and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a map of the habitat will be created to create a detailed image on the scale of the landscape of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation consultant at the National Scotland Foundation, hopes that the results show what areas of the habitat are more important to the rat population and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the management of the habitat, such as the creation of meadows, and how to improve the maintenance of forests for bats and other associated species.
The population of rats in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has decreased considerably in the last century.
Building and building restoration tasks threaten the victims, as they affect the ground floor and can cause loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and light turbines are also at risk, as are the mathematical paper and chemical treatments used in construction materials, as are domestic cat attacks.
In fact, rats aren't blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch a catch.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to place insects and obstacles in their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is taken very seriously.
He has ten experts with appropriate training, who carry out surveys, zero inspections, and sometimes usually rescued.
Even so, the organization has created the first and only reserve of Scotland dedicated to the Thrave Estate Bank, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of Scotland.
The financier, David Thompson, says it's the ideal territory for the species.
"Here, in Treve, we have a large area for the rats," he says.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all a good habit.
But we still do not know many aspects of pain, so that the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand better what they need to grow."
It notes the importance of checking whether there has been a delay before doing maintenance tasks in property, as the possible involuntary destruction of a single maternity nest kills more than 400 women and young people, as it could lead to the disappearance of all a local population.
Rats are protected and it's illegal to kill them, attack them, torture them and destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish Preservation Foundation official, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said, "We still need to learn a lot about the torments and, in the case of some of our species, we don't have enough data on their population."
Ronaldo denies charges of rape while his lawyers prepare an action against a German magazine
Christian Ronaldo has indicated that the charges of rape against him are "false news" and has said that people "will become famous" thanks to his name.
His lawyers will demand the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the charges.
Portugal's predecessor and Juventus have been accused of violating a US woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he paid $375.000 at the moment because the incident wasn't made public, according to the information published on Friday by Der Spiegel.
In a video of Instagram Live that addressed its 142 million followers hours after the charges were made public, Ronaldo, 33, said they were "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," says the five-time gold pilot's winner in the camera.
"They want to be famous thanks to my name.
It's normal.
They want to take advantage of my name to become famous, but it's part of my job.
I'm a happy man and everything's in order," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing the claim against Der Spiegel for the charges, which they have qualified as "inadmissible privacy information", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "moral days for an amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most flagrant personal rights violations in recent years".
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of the hotel and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in an analogous manner, according to reports archived in Clark County Court of the Count, Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told him he was a "99% good boy," except for "1%."
The papers say that Ronaldo confirmed that they both had sexual relations, but they were agreed upon.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of the injuries in the hospital, but later she accepted an agreement outside the courts because she had "a fear of reprisals" and was concerned "to be humiliated publicly".
The 34-year-old woman said she wanted to cancel the agreement, as she was still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to fix for King Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he fixed for Juve, the Italian giant, in an operation of 100 million euros.
Brexit: United Kingdom "would always regret" losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "always regret" if you lost the world's leadership in the manufacture after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, the Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota's base in the United Kingdom had told the BBC that if the United Kingdom left the European Union without any agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays on borders in the case of a Brexit without agreement could cause job losses.
The plant of Burnston, which manufactures the Auris and Avensis models of Toyota, produced 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU without agreement at the end of March, production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Leaving the EU without any agreement on how trade with the rest of the EU countries will work has raised the fears of other UK car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW claims to close Mini's plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to which manufacturers consider risks in the Brexit production chain without agreement.
Toyota's production line is carried out on a "just in time" basis, with fish coming every 37 minutes from UK and European Union suppliers for the manufacture of automobiles.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border, which the sector considers could generate delays and scarcity of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at the plant in Derbyshire, according to the company, and it would have to stop production as a consequence.
Clark states that Theresa May Chequers' plan for future relations with the EU is "acquired precisely to avoid these border controls".
"We need to reach an agreement, we want to get the best agreement that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," said the BBC Radio Today 4 program.
"The tests not only of Toyota, but also of other manufacturers, indicate that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains."
Toyota could not confirm how long production would be stopped, but in the long run, it warned that added costs would reduce plant competitiveness and could cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of the United the Union on the ground, said that members start to be very concerned about the situation: "By experience, when these jobs are lost, they never come back."
A government spokesman said: "We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again
The expected meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "posted for a week" while continuing the fight on the appointment to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in statements from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, links between Russia and assistance to Trump and a possible obstruction in justice by the president.
If Trump is fired or not the Deputy Attorney General and he puts Mueller's independence at risk, he's been feeding rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of taking a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of depositing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House among rumors he was about to resign.
However, a meeting with Trump was announced for Thursday, which was in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said "I would prefer not" to pay tribute to Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate's judicial committee, which was testified to by Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the entire Senate's vote.
Trump's press office, Sarah Sanders, appeared in Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he answered, "Not yet a date has been fixed, it could be this week, although it may be that one more week will be set aside for all matters with the supreme court.
I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists might object to this statement: Sanders hasn't had an informative session of the White House since September 10th.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of information sessions was not because he didn't like the fanfaronism of TV journalists, although he said, "I won't deny that they're fanfaron."
Next, he indicated that the direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president does more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, before adding the following without quoting any sources: "We have consulted these data."
Sanders said information sessions will continue to take place, but "if the press has the chance to ask directly the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me infinitely.
We often try to do that, you've seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and you'll replace the briefing sessions when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press rounds with dignitaries on official visits.
Individual press wheels are not common.
This week, in New York, the president may have shown why, after an informal appearance and, at some times, he is strange in front of the journalists gathered.
The Health Secretary writes to EU workers of the Scottish National Health Service from fears about Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country's gratitude and wishes to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter in less than six months from the UK's entry into the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the cost of state-of-the-art applications for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on exit have continued, and still seems to be headed for the decisions expected this late.
But the government of the United Kingdom has also begun preparations in case of a possible scenario without agreement.
I know it's time for all of you.
I wanted to reiterate, therefore, that I greatly appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
EU partners, and beyond, provide valuable experience and adventures that strengthen and improve the task of the health service, while benefiting the patients and communities we deal with.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie succumbs to an emergency operation after suffering from a head injury
Christian Abercrombie, a Tennessee State Tigers re-reliner, has submitted to an emergency operation after being injured on Saturday in defeat by 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to information from Mike Organ, Tennessee.
Tennessee State trainer Rod Reed reported to the press that the injury occurred shortly before the middle of the day.
"He came to the sideline and exploded there," said Reed.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing it on a bed and taking it to make more testing.
A Tennessee State officer reported to Chris Harris, WSMV from Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the clinic at the medical center of Vanderbilt.
Harris has added that "there is still no information on the type or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It's the first season of Abercrombie, second year, with Tennessee State after it's settled from Illinois.
I had completed five plates on Saturday before leaving the game, which makes a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the United Kingdom with the additional money used to help homeless people according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This action will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The increase in stamp tax will be recorded in those people who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom.
Hisenda expects to earn up to 120 million per year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers are expected to have a higher seal tax on purchasing property in the United Kingdom and this money will be used to help homeless people, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises to provide more affordable habitats that would affect higher incomes.
The increase in stamp tax will be recorded in those people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom; this money will be directed towards government action to combat the figures of homeless people.
The charge, which will be added to the current seal tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second estates and real estate speculation, could be up to 3%.
Hisenda expects to get up to 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of London's new construction properties are of non-British residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to open up to the scale of properties.
Many well-being areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "city ghosts" because of the large number of foreign buyers that spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes up weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in stamp tax to help young people have their first home.
He accused the big constructs of keeping the property prices high by quickly buying land and not using it, and urged May to cancel the quota on affordable homes to correct the British real estate disaster.
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as control over the rental and finalization of "no blame".
He also wants to give more authority to assemblies to build new homes.
May said, "Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it can't be as easy for people who don't live in the United Kingdom, as it can be for companies with them abroad, to buy habitat compared to British people who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of having a home in property is too distant and the indignity of homeless people makes it even more real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to train Scotland."
Sunderland's trainer, Jack Ross, has said that his "maximum ambition" is Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish has accepted the challenge of reviving the North-East Club, which currently holds the third position at League One, at three points of the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
They called me once as a support, and that's all," Ross told the BBC Scotland Sports Sound program.
"But I grew up seeing a lot of playing Scotland in Hampden with my father when he was a kid and it's always a thing that makes me backward in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I succeed in training clubs, but."
Ross' predecessors in Sunderland's training position include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's extraterrestrial claims that he does not feel pressure to be the next one in a list of names devoted to such a large team, after having previously rejected Barnsley's offers and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, my criterion for measuring my success will be if I can get this team back to the First League.
With the structure and facilities of the club, it is clear that its place is the First League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd only think I'd made it here if I could make it back to the club."
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach, after a period as a second coach in Dumbarton and 15 months in the hearts technical body.
She helped Aloa avoid falling into the third category and transformed St Mirren to fight for the champions of the Championship next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his stage as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a decisive moment," he recalled about accepting the task of alloa.
"I always thought training was what I was given better than playing.
Sounds strange because I did it right, I got out reasonably and enjoyed quite good times.
But playing can be very hard.
There's a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through things like stress and work pressure, but I feel good as a coach.
I've always wanted to train, and now I'm doing it, it's the more comfortable I've heard since I'm an adult."

The perfect time for a painting is 5:30 a.m. on Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave has fired consumption at bars with difficulties in Britain, but it has added more pressure to the restaurant chains.
Bars and bar chains have increased by 2.7% in sales in July, but the consumption of restaurants has decreased by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, of the CGA's financial advisor, the company that has collected the data, says: "The continuous hours of sunshine and England's participation in the world, which has expanded beyond expectations, have made July follow a pattern similar to June, with an increase of 2.8% in bars, except in the case of restaurants, which have suffered even more.
The fall of 1.8% in consumption in June's restaurants has worsened in July.
The bars and taverns, led by the consumption of drinks, have achieved the best results, while the consumption of restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered from the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we've consulted, the sales of drinks have increased by 6.6% during the month, while the sales of food have decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, of the Asian and RSM hotel analysts, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sports events continue to be the main factors related to the sales of the foreign market.
It's no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a decrease in sales of 4.8% interannual would be particularly harmful, rather than constant pressure on costs.
This long and warm summer could not have reached a worse moment for food-servicing trades and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we've had in August will provide such a necessary breath."
The total increase in sales of bars and restaurants, including the recently opened ones, has been 2.7% on July, as it indicates the slowdown in the brand presentation.
The sector's sales indicator for restaurants, bars and taverns of the United Kingdom collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined loss of more than 9 million pounds and is the sector's established benchmark.
One of five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One out of every five children, some 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers, according to data from a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has shown an increase in "False Insta" pages
News has raised fears about publication of sexual content
20% of students claim to have a "main account" showing parents
One out of five children, some 11 years old, creates social media accounts that cover adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students has indicated a rapid increase in Insta's false accounts, a reference to Instagram, the location to share photos.
The news has raised the fear of publication of sexual content.
About 20% of students say they have a net "main" account that they show their parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a message from a teenager telling others to "violate me."
Research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Committee of Directors of Private Schools (HMC) of Independent Schools, has revealed that 40% of adolescents between 11 and 18 years of age have two profiles, half of which have admitted that they have private accounts.
HMC's head, Mike Buchanan, said, "It's disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Federation of Athletics directive
Elid Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the Scottish Federation of Athletics Directive at the organisation's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the field athlete and track player with more Scottish medals, and President Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from their international experience in the last decade.
"Eilid has respect for the community of Scottish athleticism, the United Kingdom and the world, and we are sure that Scottish athleticism will benefit from its incorporation into the directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am eager to act as an athlete's voice, and I hope to be able to make sport grow and contribute to Scotland."
The United States, which won gold in the 200s and 400s at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, among a total of four Olympic gold and is currently the usual commentator of the BBC, was prevented from walking after a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "I suffered a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time would tell me if I could recover or to what extent.
It's been exhausting, but I've recovered completely, I've learned to walk again, and today it's about to do agility exercises!
Thank you for the message of encouragement!"
An advertisement that compares mothers to cows shares their opinion on the Internet
A turtle company has divided its opinion on the Internet with an ad comparing breast-feeding mothers with cows that move away.
To mark the launch of what is considered the "first silent tirallet that can be carried from the world", the consumer technology company Elvie has released an ad inspired by a musical video of joke to show the freedom that gives the new tirallet to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of flour and cows at the rhythm of a song that includes letters like, "Yes, I move to myself, but you won't see a queue" and "If you hadn't noticed, they're not funny, they're my tits."
The return continues: "Bombage, pumping, feeding babies, pumping, pumping, holding girls."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mix of reactions from whom it has been seen, many of which claim to show the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, you have to get pregnant and stop to produce milk, with the difference that they're apart from their babies a few days after you stop," one person wrote.
The Elvie thyroid is discreetly hidden in a breast support (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: "I understandably traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why don't you use them to announce a tiral to mothers who will keep their babies?"
Another user added, "It's an off-site ad."
Other people defended the ad; one woman admitted that she found the song to be "for fun".
"I think it's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I still had to breastfeed.
Bombing for the tyrant made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but you have to take what it is.
It's a great product," wrote a user.
Another person commented: "It's a fun announcement for mothers who bomb with turtles (usually at their place of work or in the sink and feel like they're cows.
It's not an announcement that he or she judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the shooter discreetly left to the supporters.
The concept that hides behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women say they feel like cows when they use the thyroid.
However, Elvie's thyroid is completely silent, has no cable or tube and discreetly fits into a lactating holder, making it more free for women to move, subjecting the babies and even getting out while they're pumping.
Ana Balarin, a mother's first-born partner and developer, said: "The Elvie tyrant is such a revolutionary product that he deserved a daring and provocative campaign.
When we draw the parallelism between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a thyroid is used and the challenges that it is supposed to do, while we demonstrated, in a entertaining and didactic way, the incredible feeling of freedom that the new thyroid offers.
It's not the first time Elvie's shooter gets on the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the screen for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children, quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children detained has increased, although monthly entry across the border has been practically stable, in particular because the rhetorical hardship and policies introduced by Trump administration have made it difficult for children to become petrified.
Traditionally, most of the patterns were paperless immigrants, who were afraid of risking their ability to stay in the country if they decided to take a child.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that the potential employers and other adults living in their homes will have to send digital fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked to receive unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no prior criminal record.
"About 80% of the people who have embraced or lived at the home of a person who has embraced are illegally in the country, and a large majority of them are criminals.
So we will continue to pursue these people," Albence said.
In order to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some to be brought before the court within a month of being detained, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to the refugee workers.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, instead of presence, to defend their case in order to obtain legal status before an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered fit for help will be deported immediately.
The longer children spend in custody, the more likely they will be to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent seizures or attempts to escape, according to the workers and reports that they have made known to the system in the last few months.
Lawmakers claim that these concerns can be intensified in larger installations, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, because of their size, the signs that a child is suffering are overlooked.
They have added that moving children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause them a trauma that many already suffer.
Syria urges the "occupational forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Minister, Walid al-Muulem, asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that war in the country has lasted eight years.
Muallem, who also acts as Deputy Prime Minister, has stated that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "the matter will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Muallem insisted that the "war of terror has practically ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced people.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this holy battle until we have cleansed the entire Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of a country struck by war.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem has stated that the conditions were good for his return and has blamed "some Western countries" for saving "unreasonable for" refugees who want to stay away from them.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these return," he said.
"They're politicizing a matter that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for reconstruction for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to put an end to the war.
U.S. diplomats have said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral area at the last major rebel base, Idlib, has taken advantage of the opportunity to continue political encounters.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces with the help of Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem noted that the agreement has a "clear terminism" and expressed the hope that military action will face the jihadists, including combatants from the Al-Nusra Front, linked to Al-Qaeda, who will "be eradicated".
Staff of Mistura, sent by the United Nations, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee formed by government members and the opposition to begin profiling a post-war constitution and preparing the way to the elections.
Muallem exposed the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, the task of which should be restricted to "review the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win for the second time
According to this logic, Trump would win the elections again in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators are likely to expect, scandals and the process of resignation ended with his presidency in advance.
What it would be, of course, is "the end of a more dramatic presidency of history."
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in maximum audience hours has doubled to CNN 1.05 million and practically tripled to MSNBC 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in maximum audience hours, from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and The Rachel Maddow Show, from MSNBC, has led cable television audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers in the main news nights.
"People have been stabbed because they don't understand," says Neal Baer, an executive producer of the ABC series "Designed Survivor", on a cabinet decree that turns out to be the president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
It recalls a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told her that he would vote Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"He answered me that because he laughed," said Scovell.
There's a point of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike television programs, the script that comes out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can meet and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, being an informed citizen is going further when you find yourself at six o'clock to see a group of experts discussing the use that Bob Woodward has made of "private use" sources for his book "Fare", Paul Manafort's construction leather jacket, "a piece of thick clothing like his pride," said Washington Post, and the consequences of the horrifying descriptions that Stormy Daniels made of, let's say, Trump's anatomy.
In my case, I won't see Super Mario again.
"Part of what makes me seem to be part of a telereality program is that every night gives you something new," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" about the change of characters and the tour of Trump's program (to talk to NFL, named Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to lose an episode because you're behind you.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and he was alone outside the house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked up looking at the MSNBC while recording the CNN.
He couldn't get rid of it, not with Brett Kavanaugh, about to face the Senate's judicial committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
"I remember when we did those crazy programs then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it would be kind of a joke, but it looks like they were right."

Foreign money floods the middle-level parliamentary elections in the most adjusted House of Representatives
It's no surprise there's an actual flood of money in Pennsylvania's 17th district, thanks to the realisation of the congressional districts that have made two current members compete for the same place.
This recent reassignment of Pittsburgh's suburban district involves Democratic Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who obtained the seat in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which conflicts with the 17th district.
The maps were redeployed after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decreed on January that the former districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the 17th district has triggered a financial war between the party's main financial organizations, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a name in Pennsylvania after an adjusted victory in a series of special elections held in March to represent the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
Republicans have been in charge for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 different points.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on Salvador for its support in China, but withdraws them
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Valera, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his associates took out the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of US diplomatic missions to Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "the recent decisions on the cessation of recognition of Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, spokesperson of the department this month.
However, only the possibility of punishing El Salvador, which in 2017 received US aid of $140 million, according to estimates, was considered for drug control, development and economic improvements.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on issued visas, would be detrimental to the Central American country and the high numbers of deaths for murder and arrest.
With the steps of internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar encounter last year and that was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants from being addressed to the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted the meeting to take place, which ended effectively with any probability of punishment for Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has been elected for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration gives, according to the diplomats.
The three US envoys discreetly returned to their posts in Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without hard messages or sanctions on Washington's part.
A spokesperson from Bolton's White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officers, including two diplomats, who agreed to debate internal deliberations since the anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also from the anonymous, corroborated the statements.
Study history
The next event could be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Trump in justice, of which there are numerous evidence in public records.
As to what is known, Mueller also investigates whether Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in its election attack.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could be found reporting to the organization, just as he prepares to do so in front of voters, and even in front of a jury of party members.
These are many circumstances, and I do not want to suggest that Trump's fall, or none of his European homonymists, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officials were willing to take a stand against Hitler, only if the Western bloc had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates on points of inflation like this and speeds up or slows down the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is currently facing a number of inflation points.
What if Trump, Rod Rosenstein, Deputy Attorney General, is the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been watering his neck since this newspaper reported that last year, he suggested to record the president secretly and speculated that he was not fit for the job.
Rosenstein claims that the Times information is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the FBI on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court all and the credible charges of sexual abuse and false witnesses?
And, in particular, will we vote in the middle of the legislature for a Congress that will be responsible for Trump?
If we don't pass these tests, democracy will start to run out of danger.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because I already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, he emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, he sent me to light up the lights of Saturday on that table with aesthetics.

Graham Dorrans, of the Rangers, face-to-face optimism against the Vienna Rapids
The Rangers took Vienna's Rapid Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive stamp in the Vila-Real field this month, would leave it in a good position to classify itself as the Group of the G of the League of Europe.
A knee injury prevented Mt. Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the season until the fourth 2-2 against the Royal City, but he thinks Rangers can use this result as a trampoline to get great results.
"It was a positive point for us, because the Vila-real is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We played the game believing that we could get a valuable result and we went out with a point.
Maybe we could have pulled something else out of it at the end, but in general, the fourth was probably a fair result.
They were better at the first, but we were better than they at the second.
On Thursday, it's another great European night.
We hope we can stay with the three points, but it'll be a tough game because they got a good result in the last game, but I'm sure we'll do it all and we'll get a good result with the support of affection.
Last year was really tough, with the injuries I suffered and the changes to the club, but now it's a good place to be.
The team's fine, and the boys enjoy it, training's good.
I hope we can do everything we can, leave the past season behind and succeed."
Women lose sound for fear of savings for retirement
Although participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about it with the family.
About half of the surveys at the national level say they talked to their partner about the long-term cost of attention.
Only 10% of the respondents say he talked to the kids.
"People want some family to take care of them, but don't hesitate to think about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Company.
We need to start over here.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not communicate with your wishes in advance.
He works with your advisor and your family to decide where and how to get attention, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial adviser in the conversation: He may also help you to determine how to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term funding options can include a long-term insurance policy for long-term care, an effective hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover your own expenses or insurance with your own resources, if you have the money you need to do so.
Prepare your legal documents: cut off your legal battles.
Find a representative to be able to appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical attention and make sure that professionals fulfill your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Consider, too, the possibility of contracting a notary acquisition for your finances.
You should select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in case of incapacity.
Don't forget about the little details: Imagine that your old family has a medical emergency and is on its way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan to be prepared.
Finance is not the only factor to be determined, but also which doctors you want to deal with," Martin said.
"What are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have this plan ready."
Man shot several times with a compressed air spade in Ilfracombe
A man got several shots of a compressed air gun while he was back home after he left for the night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
'The officers described the shooting, which took place around 2.30 a.m. (in British summer time), as a "random act".
The victim hasn't seen his attacker.
His life is not a threat to the wounded, and the police have made a call to find witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died because of a strong earthquake and tsunami that shook the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities, and the number of deaths is expected to increase.
As communications are cut off, the aid units have not been able to obtain information from the Dongala Regency, an area north of Palu near the epicenter of the magnitude earthquake of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
The following include some important data about Palu and Dongala, in the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, located at the extreme of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dongala is a regency that extends over 300 km from the coast to the north-west of the island of Celebes.
The government, a region less than one province, had a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
The exploitation of nickel mines is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali on the other extreme of Celebes.
Palu and Dongala have suffered several tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami occurred in 1996 in west Dongala that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific firehouse, and earthquakes often occur there.
The following are the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Ace, north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes affected the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Thousands of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6,8 magnitude struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 - magnitude earthquake devastated a pop-up area in Padang, the capital of the western Sumatran province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 - magnitude earthquake shook one of the islands of Mentawai on the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 20 feet [10 m] that destroyed dozens of people and killed some 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected Pidi Jaya’s reign in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the population recalled the devastating earthquake and the deadly tsunami of 2004.
This time, no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died because of the fallen buildings.
2018: A series of large earthquakes occurred in the Indonesian tourism island of Lombok that killed more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists trapped temporarily.

Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested with charges of aggression.
Palin, 29-year-old natural from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as suspect of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and arrest resistance, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a known man tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he stretched his phone.
Palin is detained in Mat-Su's temporary detention centre, where he is held with an unsecured liability of USD 500, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he declared himself "not guilty, with certainty" when he was asked how he was declared, according to this chain.
Palin faces three Class A flaws, which means he could go to jail for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also accused of a class B deficiency, which can be punished with one day in prison and $2,000 in fine.
It's not the first time there's criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of Alaskan veterans' court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, interference with the report of a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon in a state of drunkenness in relation to the incident.
His wife declared that she had given a punishment to her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticised by groups of veterans to associate her child's violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder derived from her service to Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after a earthquake hit Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks do not work and are expected to increase the number of deaths over the next few days.
The earthquake took place just on the coast of Central Celebes, north-east of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
On social networks, videos are circulating at the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had met at a beach festival in Palu city when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand an exceptional death penalty for a suspect of the New York terrorist attack
The New York federal prosecutors claim the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people: an extraordinary penalty that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to complete an attack on a Western Side Highway bike, down Manhattan, and to hit passengers and cyclists during his trip in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intendedly" and that "intendedly" caused serious personal injuries, according to the intentional warning of the death penalty presented to the South New York District.
Both criminals could be subject to a death penalty, according to the court's paper.
Weeks after the attack, a large federal jury attacked Saipov with a 22-falt charge that included eight charges of murder for the benefit of organized crime, which federal prosecutors usually use in mafia cases, plus a crime of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors claimed that the attack required considerable planning and premeditation and described Saipov's way of acting as "inhuman, cruel and devious."
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," according to the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South New York District brought a death penalty to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being sentenced by conspiracy to carry out espionage actions for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack.
The police explained that he told the researchers that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment script, Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to bring the attack to an end after seeing videos of ISIS on his phone.
According to the police, he also requested the ISIS flag to be deployed in his hospital room.
He has declared himself not guilty of the 22 missing charges.
David Patton, one of the public federal defenders representing Saipov, claimed that they were "obviously disappointed" with the charge's decision.
"We consider that the decision to ask for the death penalty, rather than accepting a declaration of guilt and a permanent chain without the possibility of freedom, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Member of the Conservative Party's parliament affirms that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the popular troops" today during a protest at the conservative party conference.
UKIP's former leader has said politicians must "sympathize with the pressure of Eurosceptics" when one of Theresa May's parliament's own members suggested that they should lead negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative MP without charge Peter Bone told Birmingham that the United Kingdom would already be outside the EU if Mr Farage was the secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge that Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when the conservatives for the union have presented themselves in another protest against Brexit in the City.
The prime minister is fighting to preserve his Chequers' commitment plan between the attacks of Brexit's partners, the Union's partners and the EU.
The allies insist that they can reach agreement with Brussels despite the negative responses and pressure Eurosceptics and the conservative party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told the meeting Leave Means Leave of Solihull that he wanted to undo Chequers' commitment.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in charge, we'd be out,' he said.
Parliament member Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we must undo the Chequers compromise."
To clarify its opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be useful.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestions that claimed that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and wants to stay there is totally false."
Brexit's conservative party Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and said in front of reporters, "I'm just telling you, Prime Minister, that you listen to people."
"The Chequers compromise is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote in favour, is unpopular between our party and our activists, who are the people who come out in the street and get us to win a few elections.
Leave Chequers' commitment and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage said that meeting politicians must feel pressure if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This, now, is a matter of trust between us (people) and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and today we're here to tell them we won't let them."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel pressure."
"We are mobilizing the popular troops of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud UK."
Meanwhile, the union partners marched to Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the city center.
A small number of activists shook flags on the conservatives against Brexit after the group was released this weekend.
The conservative member of the House of Lords Adonis laughed at the conservatives for the security problems they suffered with the party's application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canadian agreement more, for the border without friction, for free trade without frontiers in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There's no choice for a good Brexit," he added.
Warren intends to examine the possibility of presenting himself as a candidate to the presidency.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would consider presenting himself as a presidential candidate after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at an open meeting in the western part of Massachusetts.
Warren, the usual critic of President Donald Trump, is presented for his election in November against GOP State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was vice-president of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It has been the centre of speculation on the possibility of taking Trump back in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event at Holyoke was his 36th meeting with constituents with the format of an open meeting since Trump took over his duties.
An assistant asked him if he intended to present himself as a candidate for the presidency.
Warren replied that it's time for "women to go to Washington to repair our government that doesn't work, and that includes a woman in the dome."
A person arrested for shooting Sims, LSU
Baton Rouge police, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect for death was arrested on Friday at LSU Wade Sims' basketball player's shooting.
Baton Rouge's police department announced the 20-year-old arrest of Dyteon Simpson at the ET press conference at 11:00.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for collaboration to identify the man of the shooting.
Yes, 20 years old, he got shot and died near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a shot at the head that finally killed him," said police officer Murphy J. Paul on Saturday in the media for 247 sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and got a shot at Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been on the scene, in possession of a weapon, and had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Police Department in custody.
Yes, a 2 m junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge played 32 parts with 10 beginnings during the last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 turns per match.
Russia's Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton gets the world title after the team's orders gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valteri Bottas stayed in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would have an important role to play in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost exhausted Hamilton while defending his position on the first two occasions and inviting Vettel to attack his companion.
Vettel went into boxes before and left Hamilton running with traffic to the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop boxing and leave behind Vettel, but Hamilton went after some wheeled action that caused the Ferrari pilot to leave the free interior with the risk of staying out after a double movement to defend the third horn.
Max Verstappen started on the last row of the grid and at the end of the first time he was in the seventh position on his 21st anniversary.
Next, he continued in a good position much of the race, as he kept his wheels to save time, moved to Kimi Raikkonen, and moved to fourth.
Finally, he entered the boxing about 44, but he could not increase the pace the next eight times, and Raikkonen was in fourth position.
It's a hard day, because Valteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me go.
The team did a fantastic job to have a u-dos," said Hamilton.
Her body language was terrible.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Feinstein on a meeting Saturday to insist that she did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate of sexual abuse at the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's witness in front of the Senate's Judicial Committee, but commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "suffering, cruel and lying".
"One thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that's been going on in the Senate for the last few days, when you see anger, when you see people angry, angry, cruel, and lying," he said.
"When you look at the communications and the filtrations and say, "No, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document?
No, no.
I didn't filter it."
Hey, wait a minute.
We filtered... no, we didn't filter it." He added as he imitated the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the statements against Kavanaugh from Ford in July and was filtered in September, but Feinstein denied that the filtration process took place in his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't filter his story," Feinstein told the Committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to be confidential and I kept it confidential, as he asked me."
But his denial did not please the President, who commented at the meeting on Saturday night: "You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing with his defense of the candidate in the Supreme Court, accused of improper sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the democrats were using statements for their own purpose.
"They are determined to regain power by the means necessary.
You see the evil, the cruelty, they don't care who they do the wrong, they have to blame for having power and control," said the President, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the victory of Friday in the Elite against the Belfast Giants, as they won the game back 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants immediately gained an advantage of two goals thanks to the completions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised the level of their team, but then Dwyer restored the advantage of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equaled the Dundee. Then two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured his victory.
It was the third defeat of the season at the Elite League for the men of Adam Keefe, who just won the Dundee 2 to 1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth encounter of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in four minutes, at 3:35, from a Kendall McFaul's assistance. Four minutes later, with David Rutherford's assistance, Beauvillier would double his advantage.
During this initial period of agitation, Sullivan repositioned the home team in the game at 13:10 p.m. before Matt Marquardt facilitated the equalizer at 15:16 p.m.
Dwyer guaranteed the advantage of the Giants in the first break when he reached the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to its level with a powerful goal at 7:37 a.m.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran were combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the first advantage during the match at the end of the second and guaranteed the victory of his team with the fifth goal near the end of the match.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes and have their next game on Friday.
An air controller dies to save hundreds of passengers from an earthquake
An Indonesian air controller has become a hero after he dies to make sure that a plane with hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared after a great earthquake shook the island of Celebes on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
There are many reflections in the area and there are many people trapped among the runes in the city of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his companions escaped to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his place at the stunning control tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in his place to make sure that the Batik flight 6321, which was on the track at that time, could take the flight safely.
Then he left the air traffic control tower when he thought he was sinking.
He died at the hospital later.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"That broke our heart," she added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has reported that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths is expected to increase because there are still many bodies under the runes and there are still many that could not be accessed," said the representative of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, with an avalanche of up to six meters, have devastated Palu, which will celebrate a common funeral Sunday.
The armed forces and some commercial aircraft are carrying aid and blankets.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, a ambulance brings corpses.
Drinkable water is scarce.
All the minimarts have been robbed."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Red Cross is working against clockwork to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could still worsen."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the armed forces, "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?", told CNN.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Aviation accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini says now that a man has disappeared after the accident in the lake
The airline that operated a plane that was going to be anchored in a Pacific lake in Micronesia now says that a man has disappeared, although they previously said that the 47 passengers and the crew had safely evacuated the plane that was sinking.
Air Niguini said in a communiqué that, from Saturday afternoon, they did not find a passenger.
The airline claimed to be working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find him.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local vessels helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk's airport.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said there were still six passengers in the hospital on Saturday and they were all in good condition.
The reason for the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane was stuck in the pit because the runway was short.
Some witnesses think the plane passed the track up.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was very low.
"That was extremely positive," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers managed to walk with water through the belt to the emergency exits of the plane, which was sinking.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and began shouting, and he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that the mariners who were working nearby to improve a mole also helped in the rescue with an inflatable ship to transport the affected people to the ground before the plane sinked about 30 metres inside the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have died in an airline accident recorded in PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst consists of a night chronology that burned alive a woman
The prosecutor concluded the case on Saturday in the review of a man charged with burning alive a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness of the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to build the defendant's 29-year-old movements, Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from various mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted his previous statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that that day was not in the city.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he had lied, because his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that he was about two weeks ago who knew Chambers when he died.
Telephone records indicated that it was only a week ago that they were familiar with each other.
Rowlett said that, some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted text messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," said Hale.
The defence plans to start its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury during the same day.

A hip-hop selection fills its music with positive messages to challenge the negative view of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, ensures that the hip-hop has separated itself from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and fashion the hip-hop conscious again.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Commons, have now experienced a recent resurrection to the United Kingdom by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
NY Home page requests a couple for compensation after a "racist" message
A New York landlady has denounced a couple for a discriminatory payoff after receiving a wrong text message from her mother protesting because she was "another black person."
The couple refuse to be racist and compare the demand with an "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed condolences that the new maid, Giselle Maurice, was black when she got to work the first day of 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON A OTHER NEGRA person," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending him to his husband, he sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing his pifia, a "comfort" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the maid who had fired, who was African-American, had done her job badly and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received the corresponding payment on her day of work and then sent her home with a Uber.
Now, Maurice claims to the couple compensation for the compensation and seeks compensation of, approximately, 350 USD per day for work with six months' residence for which she was contracted, although there was no contract.
"I want to show you that you can't do things like that," she told the post Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to statements that they were racist, claiming that Maurice's revenge was the most reasonable, since they were afraid that they could not trust her after having offended her.
"My wife sent you something that I didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco's husband at the Post.
"But would you leave your children in someone's hands with whom you've been groping, even if it was wrong?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who compared the demand with an "extortion," said that his wife had two months left to have a baby and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to pursue something like that?
It's not a very kind attitude," the investor said.
The legal case is still unsolved and the public opinion court has rushed to denounce the couple on social networks and to condemn their behavior and logic.
Paddington's editors were afraid that readers would not identify themselves with a talking voice, according to a new card.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in relation to the letter, "It's hard to put in someone's place that the bed for the first time before their publication.
It turns out very funny, now that we know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
He explained that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before he had the inspiration to write the children's book on a small pelvic bone, was optimistic about the rejection of the book. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "aggression," after his death last year.
Describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and office that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he was not a suspicious man," he said.
"But, as Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if your son got something: you're proud, even if it's not your thing.
I think that's how he considered Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always recognized Paddington's own merit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On landing, they took their daughter to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked to save her life.
"Nad often called to say that it was very serious and that they didn't expect to overcome it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I went a call from Nad and told me that I would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say good-bye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, beautiful.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The medications they gave her to keep her body beating were consuming and getting out of her system.
She had died before she was expected to, and that's how everything turned out.
I just had to sit down and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a situation involving relatives and more people.
I had to keep the good shapes."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, now grieving for the loss of her daughter, sailed on the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted from the experience that was going on.
"No one knew," he said.
"He had his head cut and his tears did not stop falling.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt a sense of sympathy for Nad.
The feeling I needed my love and understanding.
I know I wanted her so much."
Grieving women pick up cards to prevent suicides at a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have killed themselves are working to prevent other people from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a galley bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and, at the age of 18, he was killed.
"I don't want no father or mother to feel what I have to hear every day," he said.
45-year-old Mrs. Davis, resident in Lydney, said her son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile could illuminate any room."
However, he abandoned his job before he died because he was at a very dark point.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that there is a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "because people know that there are people who can come to, who can hear, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay silent: you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her companion for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother died.
"He never said that he was not well or that he was depressed or anything like that," he said.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change of attitude.
He played deep on Christmas day, when the children opened their gifts and he looked them in the eyes and nothing."
He said his death was supposed to be a great trauma to them, but they had to work on it, "Open a hole in the family.
It's ruining us.
But we must continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future gets caught up in a row while the FBI starts an investigation.
"I thought if we could get something like what he was asking (a research with a range and a limited time), we could get some unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be destroyed by the death point of the partners.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his partners want to republish an FBI investigation?
His reticence has to do with the moment.
Only five weeks are missing for the mid-term elections on November 6, if, as expected, the Republicans do not get good results, they will see weaknesses in getting the man who wants to leave the country's main court.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call the senators and press them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, since it was his personal secretariat.
What happens after the FBI believes his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to cancel the vote and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korean "cau" deserters number with Kim
The number of North Korean deserters in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-one reached power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Ministry of Southern Unity, said that 1,127 desertions occurred last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the price increases that people's traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Normally, most North deserters are offered the nationality of South Korea.
The sources of Seoul claim that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers illegal migrant deserters, instead of refugees, and often repatriates them by force.
The relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in the last few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on the ongoing negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-one in Singapore, when they agreed to work in general terms to achieve a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves the first unilaterally," said Mr. Ri in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "historic" and is not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the Nancy Pelosi House said that the candidate in the Superior Court Brett Kavanaugh is a "historic" and that his temper is unable to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments during a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival, held in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted this way, they would have told her that she was a "historic," Pelosi said in relation to her reaction to Kavanaugh's witness in front of the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, denied the charges of having sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes shouting and without words talking about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's democrats and said that the charges against him were a "grostic and coordinated murder of a character" organized by the angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's witness showed that he could not work in the Supreme Court, since he showed his prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi showed repetitiveness when they asked him if he was trying to challenge the Kavanaugh election, if he confirmed it, and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"That's what I can say: if you don't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, you're not only able to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where you are now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge at the Columbia District Circuit Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she was concerned about the decisions that Kavanaugh could take against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe case against Wade, since it is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, he questioned whether he would annul certain decisions of the High Court.
"It is not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to enter the Court and hope to look wonderful," Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their powers.
It's a justified diatrabe: months and years of plenty of anger and can't take it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's a bit common.
He continued... "It helped me a woman who was an executive somewhere who said I was also crying when I was angry, but who developed a tactic that consisted of, when I was angry and began to cry, telling the person I was talking to, "Perhaps you think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then I went on.
It seemed bright to me."
The tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in a masculine majority office, where once I ended up crying with an indescribable anger, is that of a larger woman (a cold directive that had always terrorized me a little) who took me off the cliff and dragged me to the eye of the ladder.
"Never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they'll have you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered on an extra-marriage adventure in a boat called Monkey Business and he retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of presenting herself as a candidate for the presidency.
"It wasn't a well-thought decision," he told me while he was playing 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone said, "Blancan and the seven noses."
Since he was late in the campaign, he was late with the fundraiser, so he promised he wouldn't go to the race if he didn't collect $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of his partners, who gave $1,000 to men, were only willing to give 250 to her.
"Do you think I have a discount?" she asked.
When he delivered his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed by emotions (thank you for the people who had helped him, frustration with the system for the difficulty of collecting money and for guiding the voters, instead of doing it to the delegates, and anger, and sexism) that he was left without words.
"You might have thought you had a nervous crisis," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about the press's reaction.
"They might have thought my corporate sponsor was Kleinex.
I remember thinking: What will they put on my grave?
"Will you cry?"
How Trade War Between the US and China Can Benefit Beijing
The initial savings of the trade war between the US and China were overwhelming, and although the war does not seem to have to end quickly, a distance between countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, issued his first warning in early this year when he imposed taxes on China's main exports, such as solar plates, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week, with new oranges affecting products worth USD 200,000 million, which assumes a tax on half of all goods arriving in the US from China.
Beijing has been fighting in the same way every time, and recently it has raised the fines from five to ten percent for $60,000 million in American goods.
China has committed itself to replicating the US and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will be back soon.
Making Washington back involves giving in to some demands, but publicly leaning in front of the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the trade war with the US could benefit China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that lead to a fall in any of these countries is much more dangerous than the witnesses had predicted," says Abigail Grace, a research associate focused in Asia at the Center for New American Security, an expert committee.
Syria is "prepared" for returning refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country, devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation in the street is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that terrorists destroyed to restore normality.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to be abandoned due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their maintenance are fulfilled.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people who live in the country and need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem claimed that the Syrian regime is grateful for any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he pointed out that he would not accept conditional aid or help from the countries that financed the insurgency.
Europe's Selection Wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's selection has won the 2018 Ryder Cup to defeat the North American selection with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The US has already lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European election again won the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The North American star Phil Mickelson, who fought during most of the tournament, threw the water out of the hole by 3-16, which gave the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined on all his series and became one of the four players who achieved 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was separated by a 5&4 player less qualified of the European choice Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter, England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
He will come with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the greatest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 points of career.
"I'm not crying, but I can't help it today.
It's been a tough year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad, I'm so glad I recovered the drink.
The team is the most important... and I'm glad I was able to help," said a excited Garcia after the European victory.
Pass the link to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated the legend of North American golf Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost the four parties he had in France and now he has a career record at Ryder Cup of 13-21-3.
A strange statistics for one of the best players that ever existed, with 14 great titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The North American selection fought all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-end golf throughout the tournament.
The North American captain, Jim Furyk, spoke after the frustrating performance of his team: "I am proud of these players, they have fought.
This morning, there was a moment when we pressed the European election.
We fought.
I'll get my hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and progress.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to have been their captain.
He's got to get his hat off.
He defeated us."
