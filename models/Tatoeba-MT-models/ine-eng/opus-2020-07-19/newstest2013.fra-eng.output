A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justify their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers the latter to be a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of people killed by fraud.
In addition, Republican lawyers have only identified 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this sense, these measures will in part undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments have since 2009 enacted new laws making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon took place largely after the November 2010 elections, which will add 675 new Republican representatives to 26 States.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of voting rights in 41 States were introduced during the only year of 2011.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity card with a photo and proof of American citizenship.
Moreover, these laws also reduce voting periods by advance, invalidate the right to register as voter on the day of the vote and withdraw citizens who have their right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no American State required voters to present an identity card with a photo.
India was the first State to impose such a requirement.
The United States Supreme Court confirms the constitutionality of the Indian law in 2008.
The Republican authorities were forced to extend this practice to other States.
Over the past two years, they have been sponsoring Bills in 34 States to force voters to present a photo-identity card.
It is important to note that, contrary to Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the sickness insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million older people, do not have identity cards with photos issued by a government agency of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity.
But it often costs more than a hundred dollars to get the required ID card.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of Afro-Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters 18 to 29 years of age do not have the required identity card with photo.
Well, that's good.
Students, electors considered to be voting more for democratic candidates, are not allowed to use their identity card with a photo issued by their institution in several States.
On the other hand, these same States authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use to vote on the cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no State required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, dozens of States have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Spanish vote.
It is clear, however, that two Spanish voters on three are favouring the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators sponsored legislation that abolished voter registration on the day of the vote in eight States in 2011.
In addition, they restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to electors wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, electoral registration campaigns have contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the registration rate of new voters by 17 per cent in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other States to reduce the voting period by advance.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were Afro-Americans, while only 13% of the voters in the state were members of the State.
He was going to go with the Spanish.
They represented only 11% of the electors, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
On the other hand, the whites representing 76% of voters represented only 46% of voters voting in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by the veto of democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
In part, they were able to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have passed laws requesting the submission of a photo identification card.
However, the new rules put in place will inevitably make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democrat critics denounce the partial nature of the laws that have been voted on and see an obvious objective to influence the results in 2012 in key States.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Centre shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required for the electoral college to take the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this sense, these measures will in part undermine the American democratic system.
Prostatic cancer detection: pass the test or not?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes present wrong results, with false negative or false positive results, resulting in unnecessary medical interventions.
What makes men who are already reluctant to pass test tests even more reluctant.
Pass the test or not?
We asked for the advice of two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was much contamination among the witness groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to have firm recommendations.
Another European study concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who had a diagnosis and those who did not.
This study has also shown, with a follow-up after 12 years, that between 30 and 40% more chances of metastases are available if not resolved.
I therefore recommend the 50-year-old test, or 40-year-old if we have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at greater risk.
The key is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others who are indolent.
The patient must really be able to understand the level of risk of his cancer by offering him the possible options, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and choosing, instead, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many people who detect cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
They will be suggested to perform active surveillance and if the disease progresses, they will be offered treatment.
Moreover, the criteria for deciding which should or should not be dealt with are specified.
I therefore recommend that you pass the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether to pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the value of and the value of the APS test.

Preventing the Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of good living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancer could be prevented.
"If no one smokes anymore, this rate would increase to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette is related to 85% of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
It's a huge night for people's health.
"Today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," laments the spokesperson André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting the cigarette, the risk of dying from a fall of half cancer.
Weight
Emboss and obesity also promote the appearance of the disease, according to the SCC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, oesophageal, pancreas and uterus cancer.
"Research shows that regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," we added.
Food
The Agency also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In too large a quantity, it increases the risk of getting a colorectal cancer.
The cartoons too, and they should be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salad may result in the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," we explained.
Vitamins
Over the past few years, several scientists have studied the linkages between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not final for the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
While one observed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established anymore.
Mr Beaulieu also stressed the importance of talking about his concerns and his family history with his doctor.
"Expecting a test doesn't give cancer."
Higgs Bounne Decorated
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs bobon created a whole emotion, last summer, and for cause.
It is believed that this bobonn participates in the responsible mechanism of the mass of everything in the universe, nothing that this is.
And then this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "the worst" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it's still not quite sure that it's about Higgs.
We know without a doubt that we have an authentic new particle, and that it looks much like the Higgs bobone predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data released this week at a major physical congress in Kyoto seem to confirm it, but there is still no data available to be perfectly certain.
Let's assume that it's good for Higgs, because the chances of cheating look like lies, and let's see what it's about.
There is, in this low world, a fatally irreversible law that means that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're gonna hurt yourself.
But even though particle physics is a very strange world, it happens that it also has a law of this kind: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantal state" - this "state" consisting in a large way in some of their characteristics.
From there, the physicists classify the particles in two categories.
In one corner, there are good citizens named Fermions, who wisely obey Pauli’s principle.
And in the other, the boons, a bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can be beautiful and well located at the same place at the same time.
These buds then split into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, by others) The Part Adventure, Berkeley Laboratories: the messes, which we will not approach here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature spread and to which the Higgs boons would be in some kind of appearance.
These bees, we need to stress here, are not all as exotic as we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it's thanks to a bonbon of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" which is the "message" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "distorts" the electromagnetic field in this precise place, a little like a cauliflower thrown into a pond.
Of this "distortion" is born an electromagnetic wave (of the light, or of the infrared, or of the ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the bottoms "force carriers".
Champ plus stable
It goes the same way with the Higgs bobon, in this difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" to make this bobon appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it has to be reached with very, very high energy, a little as if it were a frozen pond whose only a very large rock could lift the surface.
That's why we need a huge particle accelerator like CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27 km circuit ring! - to achieve such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful again to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
These are not all particles, nor all materials, which interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like lovers, do it, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never keep himself on a fridge.
And similarly, it is not all the particles that interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the others (such as the photon, tend) do not.
Now, what is it that all these research can be done, Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any gap between the observations and predictions of the MS.
They are, moreover, several of them who would like to have a hard time finding it, because the least difference could open a door on a "physical new" and shut some holes in the Model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, offering no explanation for the gravity (up!) or the dark matter, which is about 80% of the universe's matter (up!).
But we haven't found any such differences in the CERN so far.
Effects
The impact of these research on the daily life of Mr. and Mrs. everywhere, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no such thing.
Hold: At the beginning of the 1960s, laser pioneers, in Bell Laboratories, had no doubt about the revolution their work was going to trigger.
They interviewed scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we have already been told by physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pushed) in 1962 - the laser was seen at the beginning as a "labo gadget".
I guess...
And then applications can also come from all the tools around the research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his optical work.
This sensor, although it was not entirely his original intention, now serves as a "eye" for all the digital cameras in the world, and it was valued by the Nobel Prize of Physics 2009.
This certainly does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but that means that, really, we never know...
Palliative Care - The Best Way to Die... ↔ The Devoir
With his Commission dying in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed shortly as a draft law is being prepared.
In this essential area, many remain to be done.
The duty has tried to look closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his Monterégie apartment.
Prosthetic cancer had left him for two years.
"They had given me five years to live, I've been seven years," he said, half-figue mid-resin, lying in his bed at Victor-Gadbois's palliative care house, Beloeil, where he came to watch.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for it," he said.
The disease is doing its job: an enormous weakness that prevents it from going alone to the toilets, and even eating alone.
In front of an appetizer for lunch, he agrees to let himself be helped to eat, resignated.
He can even smile, he speaks to strangers who deal with him, bring him his medications, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that I get healed of diarrhea, it's humiliating," he confides.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this disease.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man, he's standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the stage of the child, for some people, is unacceptable humiliation.
" It depends on the ability of the person " to accept the regression, he says.
Because, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments take place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the "medical and nurses' team that surrounds them no more than " curative " care.
For Ms. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die " conscious and stupefying " .
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I no longer have any wishes in life," she said, before accepting that we put a mask on her to help her breathe.
She still looks forward to a final visit from her son from Italy in the next few days.
In Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers, care for the body and food aid are available.
It's palliative care, which we give when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a bed of palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when we know we all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
By dying, we will accept the delivery of oral care to the brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetes will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of the day.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, dead during the night.
This morning, it's his son who will finish the beer at the feet of the dead.
"We help our loved ones as much as our patients," says Nathalie Savard, Care Director.
At Victor-Gadbois' house, the days follow but don't look like them.
On the side of a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last family assembly in the court, quiet in his ears while we drink in his honor, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds that are occupied by cancer patients under 45 years of age," worried Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to Victor-Gadbois' house come from their home, 47% from the hospital.
Problem access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is to say, care designed to relieve suffering when a patient has reached the terminal stage of his life, whether at home, hospital or at home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois house and the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer patients.
It is precisely this great lack in Quebec's health care that scares several doctors who specialize in palliative care the adoption of a law involving euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since the month of October, a manifest, signed by the summits of palliative care, including Dr Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to witness their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before it is accepted to conduct euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days in the emergency, in great pain, without doing what is necessary to relieve her.
I fear that patients are asking for death only because they do not receive adequate care.
And at the same time, several oncollars rely on their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Helène Richard's survival expectations were already minimal when she left a testing chemotherapy.
When I told my coworker that I was stopping the treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I was stopping beating, she told me.
Yet she told me I was finished!
No All-Power Care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who claim to die thank the caregivers for not accessing their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Grand Montreal Palliative Care Society, patients would be refractory to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which return to sleep the patient until his death, either in a sporadic or permanent manner.
We can no longer seem to hear this part of suffering.
Moreover, the unsolicited patient will have the possibility of having this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved always say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me," that means "I want to be relieved."
This report was made possible through a journalism scholarship from the Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road, BTP entrepreneurs, political party fund collectors and specialists of the Italian mafia tell day after day what they know of a formidable "system", combining the building industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafios.
A " industry " that cost heavily to Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's interesting how the system has been running out since we took the lead," irony Jacques Duchesneau, MP in Quebec and former Montréal police chief.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a substantive investigation into the abuses related to road work contracts in Quebec, to which the prime liberal minister of the time, Jean Charest, had only consented.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, hidden financing of parties and corruption of civil servants.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, it is stressed that the only transport department would have spared a billion dollars on contracts," some rescinding their instincts to reach a quota party!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already fallen two mayors", he adds, hoping that it can "demonstrate the strategies behind individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also involved with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
More police officers of "Marteau's Escoude" who, since 2009, would have led the "cartel des juouts" of Montreal to put the soft pedal on the inflammations of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has conducted serial searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal electors, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a town of banleyoue.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his post as Mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
He is suspected of impounding repeat wine pots in exchange for public contracts.
They are formally accused by engineers on the road to Montreal and Italian-born entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurus and Lino Zambito.
The latter made sense by explaining to the committee the mechanism of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
For three years, he himself paid 3% of the value of Montréal's contracts to an intermediary related to the mafia that was returning the money to Montréal Union, the part of Mayor Gerald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito had sown all winds in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals then to power.
He also agreed to organize an illegal fund collection for the former Deputy Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Cost-increasing equity contracts
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was operating round.
Gilles Surprenant, former public engineer, detailed it in front of the committee: in ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and pot-wins totaling $736,000, in exchange for the cost-effective.
Other road officials agreed to have the fatting of the pastry from 30% to 40% of the invoices, by extra error.
Then an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his cash with the salt money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned early in November, sinking Montréal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected members of Montréal to pull the alarm bell.
Major of the River-des-Prairies district, east of the island, it rose from 2010 against the sale of a municipal land purchased $5 million and resold... 1.6 million to promoters, full of real estate boom.
70% of money goes out in electoral campaigns
From the investigation that will finally be put in place, it says that it "puts on a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by furmises, to stop gangrene and squeeze the flaws".
The process, she said, is "feeling but positive".
We are cleaning up the plague, but we need a clean investigation unit in Montréal and a guard, so that we don't see any suspicious practices coming back.
Like we do the house.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes on his side that "slaves have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is especially concerned about the role of "elects in the course of the strategy", when they did not tremble in the bag!
Estimating 70% of the money goes into the funding of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironically says: "We told me that it was only a straw reflects the reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to $100, but this will not change the woman: "As long as electoral spending is not strictly limited, there will be money in politics."
He proposed a full revision of the public procurement and party financing system: "We cannot go any further; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will enable the house to be rebuilt on more solid bases, with more controls and laws."
If this story detracts from the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who are looking back at it in their own court...
"The PSG is not the Barcelona FC!"
This season, you have taken a new big deal with the PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
It can be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Big players have arrived.
Every day, I'm making progress on their side.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
Every day, these elements move me to raise my level of play.
And, in a match, it's easier.
Everything goes very fast in the foot.
But I don't smoke.
From my beginnings in the pre-forming centre of Clairefontaine's INF to my passage to Saint-Etienne, I have always made progress by stage.
So you will benefit from the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's recruits are used to contest very high-level matches.
They also know that each training is crucial.
What makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
Also, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my position.
He was beaten by agents like Claude Makele, who played at the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, it is not equal in League 1 and is one of the best European trainers.
He has a great experience and won many titles with pop-up clubs.
He's had big players.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
I was out of a series of injuries then.
The confidence he agrees with me also explains my performance.
What are you looking at on the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took our lead.
But we're stuck in search.
One of our major goals is the League of Champions: we are qualified for the 8th final with the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Now, everything can happen.
But we will have our word against very good European teams.
We want to finish first of our chicken, in front of Porto, in order to be able to receive the 8th final return.
Can the PSG become a large European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a large European club, Paris needs to win titles and join in the long run.
Today, that's not the case.
Financially, the GSP provides the means for this project to be implemented.
In League 1, not winning the title, like last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year, we're really in the heart of the champion's title.
Last season, we haven't gone far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We've had a very big season.
We're done with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we are supposed to be a champion...
But another team, Montpellier, made an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's good.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to carry it.
Do you think the media are waiting too long for the PSG?
It's normal to expect a lot of us in the light of what we've been invested and players that we have.
We totally accept it.
Then, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we find things to blame, it's certainly a little frustrating.
We wonder what people are waiting for more.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team is built with time.
The League of Champions has been proved to be capable of responding.
Look at Manchester City that hasn't been able, since two seasons, to qualify for the 8th final, they've also made huge spending!
In view of the amounts invested, you could imagine 15 points in advance of the tree!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, were "boasted" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is passionate.
I hope that in May we will be able to have the smile by telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up carrying it.
The PSG seems totally dependent on the operations of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
As much as we say there's a Zlatan dependency.
This means that Ibrahimic is very effective and has a lot of goals.
He's here for this and he proves he's the League Star 1.
He demonstrated everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he did is truly exceptional.
This moves others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you live the Euro 2012 with the team of France?
Like a disappointment.
I had a heart to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my wound prevented me from clinging to the time of the game.
I saw things down there and I got out of it.
Today, I can make good selection matches.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine and we must have exemplary behaviour today.
What are you looking at in the first months of Didier Deshamps at the head of the Blues?
He's got the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World.
The selector is strict, close to the players, and inspires the win.
Like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the euro.
I hope Didier Deshamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
The good zero (1-1) started in Spain on October 16th, is it a founding match?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I've never had a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Unlike current currency exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and handling costs among stakeholders.
In addition, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, made up of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euro...) and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of pairs of files.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as gifts or as means of payment.
The bitcoin course, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (EUR 23) in June 2011, fell to $2,5 months later, before returning today around a dozen dollars (the courses are identified on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competition with the dollar or the euro" and "like conventional currencies".
Bitcoin distinguishes from other types of virtual currency such as "credit", used to progress in a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But every time, a central authority controls and treats trades.
With Bitcoin, all the network nodes are both depositors of the book of accounts, auditors, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two e-mail addresses.
Unless a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the file content, it is also possible to make sure that swapped bitcoins exist well in the public account book, broadcast throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and the winner, like a temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a phase of file sharing, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "take" it all.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular print (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it's good.
The transaction is then indestructiblely linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the print.
If, for fraud, one user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orpheline because the two have different prints.
The computer that has solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to a hundred millionth, leaving the margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also seen in each increase in the calculation power.
The life of the network has already been high and low.
Websites providing Bitcoin services have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
"The error used does not concern the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also provides opportunities for money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But the cash also has this flaw.
Weight actors such as Wikipedia refuse the gifts of this kind.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, giant balances were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," said Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of a teaching book on this currency, believes much of the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are thus less expensive.
The carrier manages more and more his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in traders, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
It is enough for them to communicate an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who ensures that there are thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to be imposed, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicted.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to reassess the various risks, which are now considered to be high, in the event of the success of this currency.
We're parties to Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
Otan and the Americans are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without waiting for us.
These are, above all, the Afghan peasants whom we have punished as terrorists.
And we, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the mutilated.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders of refugees in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse foreign military presence, such as the Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arab, Uzbek, Tajiks.
Tolerable, sometimes assisted by local insurgents, they will no longer be when the West becomes more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the mountains planted with almonds thanks to French credits, was done in order.
The convoys of trucks and armored vehicles joined Kabul without being attacked, overflighted by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban disparagement on Kabul by the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their unsustainable progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country with fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Their control of the country had then been perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price of the obscurism of these peasants overrun by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Former Moudjahidin, Afghan government and current Taliban join in wanting to keep women in a lower position.
The most remarkable of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have moved to businessmen, taking up government lands to resell them in land to build refugees who have come from Iran and Pakistan, who are receiving "great US subcontracts".
They are deconceived; most of them have not fought for themselves.
People, as I have heard in the campaigns, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as those who have taken advantage of American economies will leave: the flow of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They conquered the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, and they appreciated the benefits.
About 65 per cent of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full of girls like boys.
Work will have to be provided to these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscuracy of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are mobile phones; television, and its Turkish leaflets, which present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who will command it be considered as legitimate?
Former anti-Soviet commanders are already concerned about the reconstruction of provincial militias, which will escape from central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, in the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized, strong presidential state, eliminating the position of Prime Minister since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the April 2014 elections.
But his country has been, since the 1950s and long before, dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been put on the road, no dam is in condition, no major irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control of infrastructure would have been required.
The noise was spread that Afghanistan had huge mining wealth.
This only added to the feeling that the West was just there to get rid of it.
Without energy to treat on-site iron or copper mining, or means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining operation.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to explore the huge Buddhist site and remain the most important employers in the province.
It will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depend largely on imports and exports, to restore normal reports.
The departure of the French fighting troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls', boys', French department at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, to try to "get the hearts and the minds" and to accomplish the impossible task of bringing together aid and offensive actions, a service of "civil-military actions" from the Ministry of Defence (Chemic), deleted in 2012, led, and led to the success of a small French NGO, many collective work and agricultural rehabilitation activities in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, gourmands in local work, was able to help contain insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in crop areas.
What will we remember after two billion euros of military spending?
A much smaller budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very expensive in these valleys, often more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests from small agricultural achievements from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to free themselves from the insurrection of foreign groups, what farmers have told me to do, it would be necessary to maintain a small, well-controlled and direct civil aid in their favour.
A Constitution for the Force in Egypt
It's a new poker match by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives it full powers, it has decided to play its entire business.
By taking everyone short, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had given the Assembly two additional months to finish his work.
It was almost two years ago that Egypt relied on a provisional text, repeatedly amended what weakened institutional stability and led to legal immbroglios.
This new initiative has only increased fractures in the country.
For its opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocratic delirium", continuing to "traffick his word" and to "peet the right".
On the part of its partisans, it is assured that it is a way to end this as quickly as possible with the institutional and political crisis, accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time which obliges the Brothers to give up their intention to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of finding a popular and democratic legitimacy, while the challenge is angered throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Since this use of a precipitated vote holds the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "It is you who vote for my text, whether I hold full powers," they are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange environment that 85 members of this constituent Islamist majority voted in favour of the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals were missing from the appeal.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had shut the door, estimateing that they had not been able to express their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society did likewise.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, alternate members, were added to the rush yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
No surprise, it is most often unanimous that the articles have been voted on.
Commentaries were also amused by the fact that one of the only differences of the day is expressed around... the time of prayer, some members of the committee estimate that the pendulum of the constitution was not regulated.
The text, which was still in the vote last night, contains 234 articles.
Subjects of all attention, Article 2 is finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulates that "the principles of charia are the main source of law."
The Salafiist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have allowed a more stringent application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is an indication of their good will and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", the Liberals answer, who see only a moment of communication.
Because they believe that the Constitution is being implemented through other articles.
These include section 220, which gives Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular in verifying compliance with the laws with the charia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "the people called to pronounce themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the premiers of a theorist."
The fears of the Liberals are also confirmed by the fact that the next director of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For the time being, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not oulemas, but academics, for some trained in the French system" temperature Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes "there may be an ambiguity around article 220, because the terms used lend to the religious vocabulary.
There is reference to "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, etc.].
And in the future, the question could be asked about the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide on it."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is very critical because of the extensive powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslims claim that they are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another point of dispute: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
No longer will civil proceedings be prohibited in military courts, as the human rights associations demanded.
The latter also share their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberticide.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and the insult is now prohibited, which may have serious consequences on freedom of expression, in particular the press.
In addition, no article is more effective in protecting women, says Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
The word was not contained in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was supposed to speak on television last night, events were scheduled this afternoon.
The support of the head of the state will defil them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the World Centre and a sea of pleasure await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the grandeur of Bible truth, modern comfort, and a wild nature.
Argoumenty i Fakty has held five major reasons for returning to Israel.
Go worship the holy places
Make yourselves irreversible: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who penetrates these "baptismal funds" will be touched by the Divine Grace.
As for Galilee, she is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was turned into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he sat down the storm, or where the fish was miraculous.
It is in this specific place that Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is well in Jerusalem.
The believers are on their way to the Rue de la Suffrance or to the road of Croix (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress of Antonia (pretoria), where the trial took place, then led through the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to the one of the Peter of the Onction and to the tomb.
Here is the Christian centre of the world, a symbol of the salvation of mankind.
According to Christian legend, the Monastery of the Cross is erected where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem also covers the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations, which is the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC.
According to tradition, people of different confessions leave them with small words accompanied by prayers that are then exaggerated.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of Massada fortress, former refuge against the enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain at 450 m above sea level.
Only mountain lovers can go there by their own means.
For others, a telephone takes them to this top full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m high, is the ski resort of Mount Hermont, which hosts many tourists in the winter.
A shuttle can drive you from the foot of the mountain.
Ski trails are 45 km long.
The old beliefs want pagan gods to dwell on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country has nearly 300 museums.
You can't visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that really value the surroundings.
First of all: the Israeli Museum near Knesset (the parliament).
It covers the very ancient manuscripts of Qumran, or Dead Sea manuscripts, discovered in the caves of the Desert of Judea, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: the Tel-Aviv Museum of Art.
The paintings of the impressive and expressives of Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso are presented.
In Acre, Hammam Al-Basha is waiting for you with its Turkish baths consisting of wetting of visitors and watchmen of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only Ralli private museum where you can admire Rodin's sculptures.
There are no guides or souvenir stores.
The entrance is free and gifts are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Museum of the Holocaust or memorial of Yad Vashem, located in Tel-Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the memory of children, built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into total darkness.
Scillating stars.
You then hear the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned here.
Health and well-being
The three major beach stations of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, because the water temperature does not fall below 21° while the air temperature may reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even hotter and you can swim there all year.
It is the most unique sea in the world: it occupys the lowest point of the Earth, or 417 m below sea level.
The blue water contains the flavor and it is very easy to catch the bathers, even those who can't swim.
The landscapes surrounding it are a surrealist beauty.
It is used to treat salt water, lemon, curative sludges and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, ekeema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, but also for everything just to relax.
Discover the Secrets of Antiquities
They are kept by the old city of Tel-Aviv, Jaffa, on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris which links Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the Greek and Egyptian legends of the Antiquities.
According to legend, it is here that Noah built his ark and that Persia saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived here a long and happy life.
Tourists especially like to walk in narrow streets that bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, the fate will smile on you.
In Jaffa you will be able to cross over young married people who come to take pictures of all Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you will be able to march into the Roman theater, "conquering " the fortress of the crusades.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of the Roman prosecutors, including Ponce Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Note to tourists
If you leave for Israel, do not worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollars to the euro, because they are easily interchangeable in shekels (currently $1 is equal to 3.8 shekels).
With regard to urban transport, these are mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a quick tramway and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and capable of connecting the low and high parts of the city.
It's almost a underground funeral.
The journey in all types of transport in common costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition wants to celebrate Saturday.
From Friday night to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport stop their activities.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only casser food, which excludes pork, seafood, uncooked fish and dishes made up of both milk and meat.
There is a wide range of dishes based on lamb and beef, soups and desserts based on coconut milk, but also on humous, traditional Jewish pasta, various sauces, soft pear balls, falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no wrong dogs in the streets of the Israeli cities.
On the other hand, we find a lot of well-bred cats that walk up high.
They can be seen sleeping on the roofs of the parked cars at night.
These felins like the passing places and don't refuse to be regulated.
The rental of a car varies from $37 to $24 (Hyundai Gettz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Rent a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entry to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The language of the figures
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
These were mainly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists entered the Promised Land from January to October 2012, or 51 per cent more than in 2010, before the visas were cancelled on February 9, 2011.
"What language does Moscow go": migrants save money to learn the language
While MPs and human rights activists debate what the law on compulsory language testing will do, counterfeiters selling "false" certificates have already made their appearance in the country
Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are Central Asian nationals: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force and stipulates that each migrant worker must undergo a Russian examination.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, services to individuals and to retail sales.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises that tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, knowledge of the language will have to be validated, but also that of the history of Russia and the foundations of law.
His language knowledge in Russian will have to be validated to obtain and renew his work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russia has official language status are excluded.
Those who have obtained certificates or diplomas prior to the fall of the USSR in 1991 are no longer covered by this Act.
Benefits, negative attitudes and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the auspices of the Puchkine Institute of Russian Language, the University of Peoples' Friendship, the University of State of Moscow, the University of State of St. Petersburg and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to pass examinations in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by the members of the Duma de State and the Federal Migration Service.
But, before the law enters into force, human rights defenders have asked the question in the press many times: what will that give?
What is the obligation to know Russian will change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, they respond to the representatives of the migrant service, which will reduce the number of people suffering from "slavery to work".
Many talk about the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the Russian Federal Migration Service office in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before their departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problems of foreign workers by 90%.
The problems are faced for migrants without professions, without training, who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is intended to cross the ill-honest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in an overcrowded house where he and his ten similars will be tortured for months without food and paper and will have to travel between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they are taken by their passport, and they do not touch the expected salary," confirmed the Head of Migration Services Branch for the work of Tajikistan's migrant service, Tolib Charipov.
Don't argue with me, Mr. Policeman!
However, many residents of Central Asian Republics who want to come to Russia to earn money trust that they not only know the language of the country where they want to go, but also that they have difficulty writing in their own language.
It is not their fault, of course, but their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tadjiks can afford to follow only a passable primary teaching.
In fact, their families don't even have what to feed their children without talking about how to dress them properly and equip them for school.
As soon as they get to adolescence, these young people start to earn money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's hard when you don't know the language, trust them.
"You feel reduced and faint."
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the law on language.
The examinations will only be for migrants who have legal status.
Without statute, there will be no formal examination or work at the end of the day.
However, most migrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome or defend your entry"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The administrative barriers and still these linguistic difficulties.
In addition, the cost of legalization of money: between 12 and 16 miles of rubble.
And then we can get a false record quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we don't have registration, where the cases of extortion come from.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea," told journalists Oumed Khouchkadamov, who is from Tajikistan.
"Do fast, don't miss and buy yourself a beautiful work of art"
Since the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it has been found that migrant registration papers were not the only ones to be wrong.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
False papers come out of a regular color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for anything: every migrant who hoped to facilitate the review had to disburse seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is twice as much as the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Representatives of power and human rights defenders agree that the short-term objective is to protect the system against corruption so that it is not possible to simply buy these "paper chips".
The authorities may give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the first time examination to follow language courses.
Moreover, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active contact with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against the civilian arms carriers.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether it was shooting at the weddings or killings organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who had killed seven people.
The police want to ban the port of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age of obtaining the permit of the port of arms by making it 18 to 21 years old.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the Arms Act would be introduced to the Duma of State soon.
Everyone is not satisfied to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "closed the visa".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centres, demanded to abandon "this insinuity."
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, according to the Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC.
According to the Ministry of the Interior statistics, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in police services for a period of six months in 2012, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded in the same period.
The authors of the letter are certain that the strengthening of the laws on civil weapons will not prevent criminals from supplying themselves to the black market .
According to them, today any weapon can be found in Moscow for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior states that it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from the factory to the officer
The black arms market is supplied via several channels.
The main channels are among five, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who has served for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Quarter.
Screenshot from a site taking arms commands
The first is "the military track", that is, the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by the Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," Baranets explains.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those that are handled by criminals in the order of forces.
Baranets explains that it is both weapons stolen from police stockpiles and those seized directly to the representatives of the forces.
Illicit guns have been selling since the military warehouses.
Many of the latter have often suffered explosions.
"Protested versions indicate that some fires have been fired in order to dissipate the deficit," the former military explains.
For Baranets, the weapons manufacturers are there for something.
"We see private weapons plants that do not compete with competition on the international market and that they equate the weapons on the black market, particularly in Moscow," one expert said.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
An important part of guns and guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes craft, a mafia has been formed and organized," adds the former military.
Where are the guns coming from?
Experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons in the black market.
A report on the issue was prepared in 2011 by the Problem Analysis and Study Centre for Public Administration.
Experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, explain the researchers, come from the army and the forces of the order.
Half of the weapons in the black market have been found "because of the employees involved in the work on the weapons", the report explains.
According to researchers, 17% of weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are derived from "Clandestine leaves".
A seller and consultant of a armory who has requested to keep the anonymity ensures that for a long time no one buys the weapons found by these experts from the clandestine dig; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, sellers will search for new goods in military warehouses.
The person buys by means of a unit, for example a TT gun.
We delivered her by passing the merchandise through a grill.
"He transports it in the city and sells it for 900 € by unit with two chargers," he relates.
"It is true that the police are aware of all cases, so, when crimes are about to be acquitted, it conducts a purchase of control with illegal arms dealers," the seller adds.
" Like in a luxury store "
The seller and buyer are generally found by knowledge.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered to come to the Begovaya station where someone would take me to a "coin" to walk.
The gun price, I got it in place.
Victor Baranets and Military Observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers in the markets, but there must also come by saying, for example, "On the part of such a person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter has lost a tooth."
Now I even buy a pair of U.S. pounds with the help of someone I trust.
He only gives it to me because he knows I won't give it to him.
Small new ones are searching for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Victor Baranets tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The schedules, according to him, haven't changed.
He was given a photo album in which there was "everything we want."
"I believed in a luxury store," the military remembers.
There is no secret to the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try anything.
As a potential customer, I'm not happy to buy, we go with the forest vendor and we install a target.
"We let me shoot and when I'm convinced that the weapon is working well, we start negotiating," the expert said.
A shop from his couch
Search engines display Vkontakte sites and groups where we can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, there is no need for any document and no one to meet.
"It is enough to have a precise amount of money," it is published on the website "Buying a gun or a battle machine."
Users leave their requests and ask their questions.
And we sell to the minors?
"Unlicensed, of course," asked the user "Ivan" (orthograph preserved).
"Buy TT. Moscow," writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has disseminated a huge network of false sites and has brought in people who want to buy weapons of war.
People cry about food like hungry wolves and then they re-exploit coal in Siberia
Victor Baranets, observer and former military
I heard about this type of scheme: usually, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment on automatic bonds.
"He receives back a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," explains the secretary of the Association "Right to a gun", Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets claims that by applying to the site, you can meet without weapons and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has disseminated a huge network of false sites and has brought in people who want to buy weapons of war.
"People cry about food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia," he says.
A Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, estimated by experts, can cost between $100 and 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the Association "Right to Arms", we can buy a Makarov gun for $100-300.
It will have to wait about a month and a half.
It came out of long warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official departmental data, compared to January-October 2011, the number of these crimes decreased by 7% in Russia as a whole and rose to 22.9 miles, while the reported cases of theft and exorcism of weapons, ammunition, explosives and bombs decreased by 7.8%.
United States: fast food and supermarket employees are underway
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through cashier work at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen against the low wages practiced by the Walmart supermarkets and the famous fast restoration chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will take up the width or get out quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of associations on the left.
In parallel with the increase in modest wages received by basic employees at Walmart and in fast-resistance chains, the organizers of the events wish to obtain the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Monday Black", when a disbursing rain of balances swept by millions of inhabitants fell on America and sometimes triggered sparks.
On that day, some Walmart employees, who work in the world 2.2 million people, left their post to organize strike tickets with trade unions and left-wing activists in the company's stores whose products are intended for low- and medium-sized class consumers.
Walmart commercializes everything: layers of hunting rifles through car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products are on average 8% to 27% less expensive than in large supermarkets.
That's why many poorly paid employees at Walmart run only at their place of work.
The price and choice of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can sell its products in the market, particularly because of the low wages of its employees.
The latter are also complaining about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of lifts or portable scanners.
The participants in the "Black Friday" events demanded an increase in wages, and they complained that the company's price of medical insurance had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For Walmart's basic salary that affects $9.5 an hour, it's an amount he can't afford.
Scientists at Berkley University in California show that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 per hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
It is 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred all the increase in wages to the shoulders of consumers, each race in the store would return to 46 cents more.
They will spend only $12,39 in a year more than now.
Walmart's supporters were pleased to note that the protests had taken place in only nine States and did not harm the group.
The "Monday Black" continued in stores from 8:00 a.m. to midnight the next day and Walmart sold 5,000 items over this period the second time.
Its cash registers carried out a total of 100 million transactions for the "Friday Black".
Dan Fogleman's spokesperson assured in an interview at the Huffington Post left that in any "less than five" Walmart employees had left their positions and that the protest was only a "com' operation among so many others" of the organizer's union.
"Next client!"
The protests continued this week in New York and did not concern Walmart's shops (in this progressive city, they are not very appreciated, so they are not yet installed) but McDonald's and other good-market restaurants.
McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and then they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the job you did honestly!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the City Council of New York
Currently, the minimum wage provided for by federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food increases them over time, but on average, its basic employees reach $8.90 an hour.
No one touches less than them in this city.
For me, living with this sum in New York is inconceivable.
It was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living at their parents' home.
Few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about living with this salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, there are comments on the Wall Street Journal forum saying it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know what you're going to feed them with.
The demonstrators who launched the movement Thursday at 6:30 am near McDonald's 40th Street and on Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast food cooks be paid at a minimum of $15 an hour, or more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also asked for trade unions to be established in the fast restoration sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing the Protestants of a union by brigades or dismissals.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, taking care of the rapid restoration remains a difficult task, and this, for concrete reasons.
One of the main is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They don't agree.
Other stormy events were held near several other fast restoration chains.
The dramatic moment of the protest was the meeting in the middle of the day near the McDonald's Times Square with the intervention of several local democratic politicians, including Jumaane Williams, a member of the Municipal Council, who said, "McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and then they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the work you've done honestly!".
The demonstrators were supported by other New Yorkers for the purpose, including the candidate at the post of Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we all have to support the employees of the rapid restoration so that they get a fair wage and the economic well-being that each New York deserves.
The New York Times has characterized this event as the most important event in the fast restoration sector in all its history.
But only a few hundred people participated, not knowing that they were not all fast-food employees, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is for the moment difficult to say whether this mass-moved cell will make small ones.
"For the moment, we only happen to have an average brain failure"
Recently, fans of new technologies used to perceive the increased reality through special glasses.
At the beginning, Google released its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it appears from the interview with the director of the 3D interactive technology group of the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this society, the glasses are already from the ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the naked air, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Can you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We work on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time try to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained for the time being in pixels on the flat screen and sometimes in touch.
We want to look at 5 to 10 years ahead of us and see the radical changes that will take place with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the command by the gesture.
- What does the future hold for us?
- Although Kinect has made physical interaction, many things occur on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The acquisition of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance is not real for the moment.
We try to change this and we work on truly 3D imaging systems operating on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to get the computer world out of the world, in the physical world, to make it more tactical.
For this, however, we need to identify not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Thus, we will be able to complete the real world by virtual objects in a more practical form.
And for starters, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of the voice command?
She's appreciated, but isn't she overestimated?
It cannot be said that it is panic: the issue of confidentiality is raised because we do not always want to inform others of its actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each one in its niche.
For example, to order equipment in public places, we had a project for which we retire to gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discreet, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a hand-held bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is now large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed order, for example: gesture + voice.
- That's what I'm saying?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this pen to you?
You'll do it with the word and gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt depending on what the machine can or cannot do at a given time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual relationship.
I think that very soon we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify human reactions.
It can be laser sensors, for example, they produce a pretty good deep resolution and it is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you don't like in modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we are based on our work on 3D recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get about 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
With regard to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, and this adds work to algorithms designers.
The resolution must be kept in mind according to axes X and Y, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/s are not really enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Batiche, from our Redmond laboratory, has given the sensors a regular delay of treatment between 1 and 100 μs, and the current sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Everyone does not understand the extent to which this affects the interaction of man and machine.
I would need a device like this in my work, but I don't need to touch, to have more frames at the second.
- But shouldn't we increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect today has three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other, one of the signal receivers.
And the third camera is actually a normal sensor of the visible field.
It does not serve to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or the empire by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a similar flexible product in Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how this could help define the locations.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, didn't present his glasses to the public.
Don't you think that from a daily point of view of the use of the technologies of increased reality, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone is not practical, but here's what I think: the best option would be an increased "transitory" reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to switch glasses to the smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal device and this is what makes them strong (the personal elements are those you are the only to see) and at the same time their weakness: the increased reality from the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the handling of virtual holographic objects in the air is only more accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the simple mortal.
There is a problem on which the opponents of this idea point the finger: there is no tactical sensation!
Hands don't feel anything!
How does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my course, I often say that the increased reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could be very good at adding tactical sensations.
For the moment, one of the most interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as image support.
She records the pressure perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really designed to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasound rays directed to a specific point where the finger and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of an air blow on the fingers.
There are also wrists on the wrists that influence the nervous limbs of the fingers, they are also a work axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
Does he believe that he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried yet.
There is still a task below which it will still have to go on for a long time: the way to make someone physically in a very small space who walks in an almost endless open space - we work on the concepts of racing carpets (not to be seen with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
For the moment, there is only average brain failure, and many years of work still remain.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The realm of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The Front Guard of Petersburg" dedicated to the citizens who are in advance, to the front guard of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors from the artistic scene of Saint Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the city border and who have found recognition in Europe after being known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known as Kirill Miller, this man rather than barbu, all of red clothes that can be crossed near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden, or even in the parties and latrines.
The Kirill Miller tables always gather the crowds, regardless of their location.
He is one of the land-based and philosophical martyrs of Petersburg, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is an outstanding representative of the Pétersbourgese front guard of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in good mood.
He recently took in his hands a barbaric organ and became the symbol of this instrument in Saint Petersburg, as he had been sufficiently mature for this difficult role because of his existence, philosophy and his image of Bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you run the city all red and not turquoise yellow or blue, for example?
- I've chosen the red as a specialized tailor in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between painting, image creator and society.
Even in society, anything that is not gray causes aggressiveness and a negative agitation.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize you were supposed to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Palais de la culture Nevskiy where my work was located.
I realized it was my way.
So the wave of the old non-official paintings had passed and the new, free, in my kind, were not understood.
I began to associate myself with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no further wave.
I'm interested in theatre, fashion, music, all kinds except words.
It was important for me to find myself in the center of St. Petersburg's culture where the best creative forces must be brought together.
In 1995, I took place in Puchkinskaya-10, which was a musical and artistic club, a Bohemian club, the house of the petersbourgese bohemian.
Many were born there: The NOMs, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Black and his friends sang easy play-back songs in moving bubbles, among them Igor Vdovin, a fashion composer today.
When the group started to produce live, it became Leningrad.
Trakhtenberg did not eat bad shows before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was when his great career began, but his basic training and education, it was at our home that he received them.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboyedov": these are the implications of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees have gone as usual.
I'm a hero of the past century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named "Peer of the Year", and that's when my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, we can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- A lot of my tables are hits, they have a very high current and a strong acre.
I'm going to have a programmed exhibition "The Russian Museum through the clowns".
The clowns belong to a contemporary category.
Before I was a socialist, today it hurts and it's afraid to be like that.
But with the clowns, everything goes away, the tragic falls.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and compulsory decoupling.
Today, it is the habitat that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not within the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we need to crack him at the trunk instead.
And the lie will be eliminated by deception.
We've recently seen you in the role of Barbara's organ player. - A cultural city must have this kind of hero.
Who else I can play.
- But maybe commercial art can be nice, too?
- Today commercial art must be cared for, delicate, liqueur.
Disintegration of culture is taking place.
Before, people were divided into groups, the bohemian partisans loved one thing, the next.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 ticket to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Each sees 100 fans.
- But thousands of people come to Stas Mikhailov!
- They're people who've been thrown away who come to see it. It's the sexual and social side that goes.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles won't come, and at the end of the account is less management, money, all desperate.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to fool them, not to ruin their lives.
When I was young, I was picking up tables that a collector had raised next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the tables that are usually the ones that we paint at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said: there is spiritual culture, consumption culture.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of the painters who lived in poverty and lived in poverty and who refused the money just for painting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in Saint Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of the culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the rule of good tsars, it was not like that, the tsars did not understand culture well, but they understood that good experts should be kept.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in Saint Petersburg who might be experts, but they're gone, because we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and break their path.
At present, it is the "king of taste" that flourishes.
The same Erarta, but they differ in this sense that they honestly say that they do not take all the contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.
- For you, what is St. Petersburg?
- Saint Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a land for that.
And on our stones, art is bad to push.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are a lot of curious people going to see exhibitions, concerts.
At our house, this bed is very fine.
We have to make art as fashionable as it was in the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange
Hide in space
The Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with land on board are starting to search for a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a great question arises: how do we continue to live our species as a hostage or on a rescue planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
In fact, there are two real planets that can be won, only by hypothesis.
"It is Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Sourdine, researcher at the Astronomical Institute of State P.K. Chternberg (GAIkh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500 .
We can only live in very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
We started to take an interest in reproduction issues in space by focusing on the flower.
Another half century ago, we had experiments on plants.
Four generations of small peas grown on orbit did not differ in any way from land varieties.
Then, insects, small playwrights, were put on orbit.
In 1979, hatchlings were sent into space to see how an embryo developed as a parent.
We get a completely normal dust at the exit.
Then the problems begin.
" The problem is that the dust must find support, it must be put on its legs and start moving," explains the director of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
Not finding any support, the dusts dealt in a way that was confused.
And at the end of 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The dusts did not respond to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would just die at the end of four days.
"We plucked their eyes twice, then left them, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev, realizing the failure of experience with dust in space.
The last "miniature ark" with animals was sent on orbit 16 years ago.
The experiences will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the biosatellite " Bion " will only cover species of the same sex.
There was an experience with rats sent with their fetuses in space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
"It was still biosatellites and then it's the only experience. We have to do this kind of research," said Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the rats of space gave birth to their breeding.
However, reproductions are still not possible directly in space.
It's not a bad thing.
By losing their normal environment, animals are no longer able to achieve their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, man is capable, in principle.
The wise Homo has abstract thinking, it is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not achieved for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female organism is what humanity has more precious.
Our moustache flew and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
" No one answered this question," explains Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, retired from the field of rockets and space.
In June 1964, just a year after his flight into space, the first cosmonaut woman Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaiev, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman Svetlana Savitskaya, after being twice on orbit and even working in an extra-vehicle environment, gave birth to a son.
However, there is a risk of losing it.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have nothing and give birth to a offspring in full health after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during orbit flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, heroes of the Soviet Union and heroes of Russia, Valery Poliakov.
However, mankind must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre: mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero fleetability, the cosmonauts take to extra-vehicle exits.
The water imitates the climber.
If for adults, water is comfortable but a foreign environment, for infants, it is their true element.
The small amphibians seem to confirm it: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
To the extent that the baby evolves for about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of her mother's womb, it is easier for her to get used to water.
It is logical in principle because from birth to first bath, it takes only 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains the swim instructor for infants, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born the kidnapper is a more natural condition, the woman needs gravity, a force of weight.
The muscles of the belly, the basin are atrophy very quickly, the baby's push capacity is lost.
All right, let's just ignore this by relying on the touch simulators.
Of course, we can prepare a shelter in a special room, and the woman will be able to get it out.
"And then?" asked Valeriy Poliakov to ask him to think about this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
If it does not feel the earthly attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or the muscle system.
You cannot dress a baby as an adult with a special combination for training.
It will simply be deprived of its vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will end up returning to Earth of a disabled, totally unsatisfied child," says Igor Pestov, Director of the Committee on Bioethics of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Academy of Sciences.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, in time, this will become a reality, when the Terreins will return to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space.
The head of the ISC (Higher Financial Control Institute) said: "The control of independent pseudo work (Czech " Schvarc system ") has failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it is at the heart of its application.
That is what Miloslav Kala, the vice president of the Higher Financial Control Institute, said in an interview for Aktuální.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be just and, in my opinion, it is what makes a flaw in us," Kala said in her comment on the current situation.
A joint control by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice the approach of the " Schvarc system " by Petr Necja.
Mr. Prime Minister recently stated that ODS was not going to import entrepreneurs with checks; is it allowed or prohibited?
"The law must be properly enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of the government cannot prevent an authority responsible for inspecting compliance with the law," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control in the Chamber of Deputies, you referred to a Czech-German project that compared the public procurement legislation of these two countries.
What was he specifically asking about?
This is a parallel check that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public markets and specific national legislation, as well as a practice that follows it.
We have gathered all this, and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have appeared: generally speaking, our legislation may be "more severe and of better quality", however, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not enough to continuously develop more detailed rules, but that it is necessary to devote itself to the implementation of the law itself.
What can this project help you in concrete terms, and what is the result for you?
A joint control of this kind should just help us to stop trying to clarify the laws, reduce and improve the thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the matter at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and any criminal activity.
But by lowering the thresholds of the markets, we will not necessarily achieve this objective.
It might be that this system is so submerged by the paperwork, that those who are looking for flaws will find much more opportunities than if the threshold remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems regarding the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different way of organization?
In the case of institutions, similar to the ISC, the Bundesrecundungshof, which is organized in a similar way, also has a slightly different advice, but these two institutions are essentially similar.
The powers are also, to some extent, similar, with a nuance compared to our system: Germany is a federal structure, therefore it also has a course of such accounts at the level of the different Länder.
The BHR can only control the federal money, which corresponds to the state's resources.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities are controlled there at the level of Länder's accounts.
With regard to national legislation, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without specific data, however, in some areas, Germany is often designated as a model, but it certainly cannot be said that it is doing better in all areas.
Could it be because they have better inspectors?
No, of course not, but I repeat, I do not have comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country that we consider to be a model is also faced with a whole range of problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have any advantage to cooperate with our institution, would they?
With regard to national legislation, what has it meant for you as an institution, the amendment of the Public Markets Act, have its effects already been felt?
Since this amendment has entered into force relatively recently, it has not yet had an impact on our control operations.
As we carry out post-control checks, we have to deal with a certain delay.
Our observations only concern, at the moment, the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new instrument of "denomination of bad management risks" with which we have made the call to nearly 14,000 public markets - these changes will be heard well because the thresholds have been changed, as well as the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so on.
So do you consider the adoption of this law to be an advantage or an overload for the administration?
I think that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more stringent and that it is not possible to comply with them.
Already under the previous regulation, the claimant (e.g. the Regional Council, in the case of regional operational programmes) committed controlled subjects to accept that any violation of the Markets Act meant a lack of budgetary discipline.
So is it really useful to make the law more difficult in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who make formal errors without consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will make the administration pressure better.
So what's the solution to get out of it?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that ODS was not going to import entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Schvarc system prohibited or authorized?
The law must be properly enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of the government cannot prevent an authority from inspecting and demanding compliance with the law.
He could say, "We're going to change the law and authorize it," but he can't say we're going to act as if it was nothing.
The Markets Act contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out, and that is precisely in order to protect the call for tenders.
But it is also tragic that a bidder will be eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, what is lacking in us.
The roads are frozen, but most of them remain practical.
In some places in the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also drowned.
However, the network remains largely practical, in some places with increased surveillance.
Region of Karlovy Vary
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were practical this morning, but by frozen and also snowy places.
Temperatures fell and oscillated between -5 ° and -10 ° C, but they should be slightly up in the day.
The snowfalls have stopped in the region and it remains in the plains only a fine snowfall.
However, the mounts of Metalifers (Krušné hory) are covered with about 30 centimeters of snow.
There is evidence of the regional road maintenance service that due to the fog, visibility was reduced by places.
The R6 fast road and the national roads in the region are now feasible without difficulty.
However, surveillance remains to be put on, for example, on certain points where the coating can be frozen and smooth.
All departmental roads and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also practical.
It is still on some of their sections of the frozen snow remains and by traffic-scattered places.
In particular, in areas of altitude, drivers need to strengthen their surveillance.
regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Roads and Motorways Directorate reports on its website that some of the roads of Bohème of the East are threatened by the formation of verglas and that snow layers charged by traffic can be found on the roads in the mountainous and altitude areas.
Road maintenance services protect drivers from the risk of glazing in areas in the high altitude region of Pardubice.
There may be a glass in the vicinity of Lanškron, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, and this, mainly on the departmental roads and third category.
Routes I/43 and I/34 around Svitaviy were chemically treated.
The snow is mainly found in the Monts des Giants (Krkonoshe) and the Monts de l'Aigle (Orlicé hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Knějnou and Trutnov, a snowbed covered by traffic is present on the roads in the altitude areas.
In Bohème of the East, the weather will be dry today, most often exhausted, with possible cloudy passages.
It will blow a low wind and temperatures will generally fluctuate between -3° and +1° C.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region today are practical, although, by places, there is a need to be increased surveillance and to adapt its conduct to weather conditions.
It cools this morning, temperatures rise between -3° and -9°C.
After the last snowfall and the following cooling, some communication routes may be frozen.
Drivers can expect to pass through fog areas, but visibility will improve gradually.
This is the result of information from the regional road maintenance service.
The D5 motorway is practically easy to use, however, road communications maintenance services recommend increased surveillance between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The coverage of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in the Pilsen-South district and in the Tachov district.
The departmental and third-category roads are wet and in this case the ice-cold guard is applied.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on the less frequent roads in the Shumava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers arriving in the high altitude areas of the Olomouc region today have to have a thick and soft snow layer on the roads.
This layer remained on the col says "Chervenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after chemical treatment operations.
Snowfalls forced road maintenance staff to go to the ground that night; according to the road management services, it fell more than three centimeters in the Shumperk district.
In the other parts of the region, most of the shoes are practical without difficulty.
" On the heights of the Shumperk district are snowy remnants.
Drivers traveling towards Jeseník have to wait for the "Chervenohorské sedlo" col "a layer of thick and soft snow" today told CZEK the head of the Schumperk district road maintenance services.
Their colleagues in the district of Jeseník also set off during the night; according to them, after the chemical treatment performed, the roads are now disengaged and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc the roads are easy to practice, however in the district of Sternberk drivers should be careful in the woodland areas for wet shoes.
Ústí nad Labem and Liberec regions
Since this morning, the North Bohema Road Maintenance Services reported several difficult crossings.
There is evidence from the police that, in addition to some snow or glass areas, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
The temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitudes, so snow and glass should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially in the south east of the central Plateau of Bohemia, there is, on the contrary, no problem and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported for the time being.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of verglas, including around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snow source during the day, sky drained and ice during the night.
It is also reported from the main traffic axes that difficult conditions on national road 13 to the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that have been curved under the snow's weight until they reach the shoe.
Šimon Ornest said, "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month this should be the end of the world?
It's just one of these new alarms, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our group The Tap Tap, it is said that we are the only group that can collect a positive balance of energy in order to reject or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December, you will have a truly unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project more in detail to our readers?
It has been a charity that we have been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the potential marketing of the Maya calendar announced on 21 December at 11 a.m.
On December 20, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will almost end when the Maya calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, which is located in the Pacific Ocean, on an advance time zone of 12 hours compared to us.
Who had this idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want, together with the public, to reflect on the state of the world that we leave our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique objects, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group with other interpreters also recorded a hymne against the end of the world, entitled " End of the Canceled World " (Czech " Konec wędava zrušeno ").
She's already very popular on YouTube, will we understand her at these charity concerts as well?
Of course, all at the end, finally, if we succeed and that the end of the world does not take place ...
It will be sung simultaneously by all interpreters in the three concerts.
Hymnes will also meet at a given time in the context of a live broadcast, in fact unique, of Czech television.
The words of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also plays the main role of Jesus in the moment, Xindl X sings also...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other Czech show-biz personalities, because we organize many charity concerts and events...
We strive to make them participate actively in these projects.
It has happened that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it is fun.
What will be the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studio training centre, which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we are working on within the Jedlikka Institute, with the Tap Association, for six years.
Teachers regularly visit students at the Jedlikkov Institute and offer them activities that interest them and entertain them.
Students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlikka Institute, we will transfer this project to an independent new building.
Several music groups and interpreters will be on stage at each of these concerts?
According to what criteria, have you chosen them?
We have tried to develop a programme that addresses all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, they will go on stage Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other " mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the spring of Prague; here we will certainly prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the Czech Republic's house in New York and personally, once in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group composed of persons with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so terrible that it looks first.
We have five electric armchair members whose tools must travel in support, of course we also trim a lot of luggage and toolboxes....
So far everything has always been more or less well done, ČSA and British Airways have always been perfectly prepared for us, they have surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we came back recently, everything happened without any problems.
Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare what these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of the public opinion for persons with disabilities and so on.
What has been your experience so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just been witnessing in Moscow that it is all just in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to people with disabilities; there, it is still not common for a person to move alone in the city centre.
They still do not consider it an evidence of giving priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities is being created.
What are the more developed countries in which we must find ourselves?
There's a lot of things we're still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements still depend on the efforts of the individuals concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a heavy disability to move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilets, to the museum, anywhere...
It is not even very common down there that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in social life, at this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather opposite to the point of progress!
Respect for the public and access facilities are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or famous lawyers.
For the time being, it is only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what prompted you in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as an educator at Jedlikka Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people who were willing to invest in something.
And as I am myself a musician (I play, among other things, from saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a musical activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Ládźa Angelovic says, we have a little lost control of the situation.
Success has only happened in the last few years, if I don't cheat?
True, creating links with well-known singers and working actively to promote the group helped us.
We understand that if a work is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to the European Union grants, we can also allow us to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to change things.
The show business is full of stuff that copies each other.
In a way, it is logical: all that is new is carefully accepted and it lasts for a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I tend to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally mercy, it is natural ...
But mercy is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned of all, that we must take in mercy.
They are people who can live a whole life and grow up, provided they have the necessary means for sure.
I often say that when people with disabilities come to realize something, it is not just an advance for them but for society as a whole.
Is your success not also due to being a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and require some discipline.
But I think it's totally normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize they have to come to repetitions twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the streets for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were there in 1998?
Un seul, Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come in and out, we can't do anything.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the case on Thursday, 20 December 2012, from 2 p.m. to the end of the world.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, in Brno in Fléda and in Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relays when the song of the group The Tap Tap " End of the Canceled World " will be sung together.
The purpose of the concert is to gather funds (up to 25 million CZK) to equip the multifunctional Studio training centre in Prague at Jedlikka Institute.
The price of a ticket at this concert is 400 CZK, the entrance is free for children up to 12 years old, the ticket prevention is open in Bohemiaiticcket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency countries, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of that agency, the second member of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had begun close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and over the years it has participated in a number of projects of the Agency.
Poland's road to space, however, began much earlier.
Already before World War II, passionate Poles were working on space flights; they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, the conference of A. Sternfeld at the astronomical observatory of Warsaw on 6 December 1933, in which he presented ideas drawn from his avant-garde book entitled " Introduction to Astronautics " .
The developments of this young engineer (born 1905) left the cold audiences and years later Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch prize in France for his book " Introduction to Astronautics ".
Ledit Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) then became a major promoter of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books on this scientific discipline.
Gadomski has become a promoter of world-renowned astronauts, and his contribution has been rewarded in particular by his name being given to one of the criteria of the moon's hidden face.
Since 1925, a drone was built in Poland to be equipped with a fired engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project is known.
It is no longer clear if the rifle was to be used to propel or stop the drain.
The only information known about this is that of the press at the time.
Starting in 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote itself to the rifles.
The research was carried out by the Institute of Komorka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustav Mokrzyckiego.
It appears from the documents retained that this research had reached the stage of the tests.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the research was interrupted.
In 1937, the plans for a photoelectric hunting rifle, drawn by the Rohoziński engineer, appeared in the special press and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakitobomba latnicza" was published by a writer named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
These two projects had a military use of rocket engines for the purpose.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of fusion technology were carried out by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczysowy Doradczo-Naukowy Committee), which coordinated all the work.
This committee had been established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other aeronautics works were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautique Society (Polish Towarzystvo Astronautique).
For the first time, it is a matter of a company in the November 1954 issue of the Problem Journal, in which there are four more detailed articles on aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Subotowice, it is proposed to create a company dedicated to astronautic
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that space research was in the future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) made efforts to enter the International Astronautic Federation (established in 1951) and since autumn, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, PTA's first president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice-President of the International Astronautic Federation.
He kept his post until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the crowned development of the RM Meteorological Fusion (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish Fusion to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rifle of 1,800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Then an improved version was built, RM-1A and, during the summer of 1959, two-storey RM-2 flight tests were started in the Bledov desert.
This rifle had a length of 1.4 meters and was probably 11.5 kg.
The following prototype should have been able to perform specific scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind at an altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rifle was developed during the period 1962 - 1965, followed by the first RM-type rifles.
This rifle, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had an area with a volume of 0.4 litres, while in Meteor-1B it was 0.34 litres and in Meteor-1C 0.62 litres.
The maximum width of all these types of machinery was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed at the Aeronautics Institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rifle had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were then built.
Poland's entry to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later should be mentioned.
As part of the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites, and in 1978, pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimir Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut.
The repeal of the Public Service Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Service Act.
This decision raised a lively discussion in the public opinion.
It is undoubtedly interesting to examine this issue from a broader point of view.
Economic systems aimed at liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means that the various economic entities and national economic systems are permanently in conflict with each other.
This results from the principle of freedom of trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital linked to a financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the price of work (wages) generate tensions over prices.
The following meaning should be added: a producer strives to import low-sales goods to withstand economic competition by " making the price of the competitor more expensive, in order to remove a larger part of the market and thus increase its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transfer production abroad, or buy at low prices, or disappear. The result is a significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Given that private capital has no social responsibility and thus also the responsibility for the unemployment it causes, the social burden of the State is increasing necessarily.
All of this intensifies the perfect will of employers to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for the benefit of the race.
This situation is at such a public awareness that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create in different economies a situation in which governments in different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments put their own population at the expense of private capital without taking into account social collapse.
This is reflected mainly in the amendments to the laws in force.
The objective is to economically compel its own population to accept the dictatorship of private capital prices, particularly in the field of wages.
This is done on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and on the other hand by restricting the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation.
This results in increasing poverty and deepening the differences between the rich and the poor.
In RFA, there have been years of public food distribution points for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work.
There are already millions of these people.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common for employees to receive such wages as the State is forced to pay an extra to achieve the minimum vital.
For example, such a scandal has been updated in the case of employees working as assistants to the federal parliament.
The economic measures of practically all the Member States of the south of the EU undoubtedly create a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or to live with wages of poverty, on the part of society, in hopes that one day private capital invests in their countries.
We need to ask ourselves this question: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, poverty will pass from one country to another; this capital may not come anymore, or then a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a European wage.
This also applies to all Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media claim that the State cannot invest in capital in its own economy, that the economy leads to an economic disaster.
The private capital strongly advocates the idea that the State cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence and, even today, does not govern, according to its own selfish interests, the policy and by the same token, the entire state.
The answer to that question is no doubt yes.
The evidence is that there is practically all-powerful and present lobby in all States.
This resulted in a desperate situation in the area of corruption, through mutual advantage, in legislation, where everything is punishable but not punishable.
In the RFA, the situation is such that, due to the lack of financial resources, the national departments delegate the development of draft laws to industrial-related law firms.
These bills are then adopted in the Bundestag.
The whole of power comes not from the people, as the Western-style constitutions said, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that the liberalism-oriented democracies are now rapidly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book "The crisis of the Roman Empire at the time of Caesar and Pompeii": "The State has long been in full delinquency and the functions were attributed to violence.
Potassium cuts, illegally obtained favors, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The under-tables and corruption spread without limits, and the people turned to the elections with votes already sold" ... ... "The honest people did not seek any office, it resulted once the state remained unconsulted for 8 months."... 'We really began to say that the remedy for this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it had to choose an energetic man"... It is true that Appianos had the Pompey spirit, but it is Caesar who has irreversibly transformed democracy into an absoluteist regime.
In conclusion, as in the past, the present society is based on the preference of personal profit, regardless of the interests of the society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and assert the interests of society as a whole.
As a result, today as in the past, a decade without previous elites, without any effort to reform in depth.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal-type democracies can be seen as a sort of break before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human life, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Service Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at the international level and at the European internal level, the Czech Government will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen state capital investments in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the position of private capital monopoly in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Chaos Laboratory.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and never will be able," says Sting in the song entitled Fragile whose main verse of the refrain is "not to forget how fragile we are."
"If my son did not want war, there would be no war," said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild's wife on her death bed in 1849.
As a result of the recent wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have been raised.
Some take the part of Israel, asserting their right to self-defence and placing Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, calling for the racism of the State of Israel, genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about the question of who is guilty and who is the victim of repeated killings in its waves; all of them, the present inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, are born in this political situation and have not lived through the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer readers a point of view "on the back of the curtain", on which they mainly benefit from the tensions that have been lost for more than 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East country.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to the study, others come from my own understanding of it, or more precisely from the group of individuals, who is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily the history of a struggle for power.
At any time, we can find an Alexandre the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or whether they owe their actions to someone who guided their actions on the basis of previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we live at a time when the world's wealth is concentrated between the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating some powers has not been able to occur in a single generation.
One of the families with astronomical wealth is the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the herd (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I don't exclude it).
It's not written about them.
Of course.
Since the 1990s, they have acquired the first world press agency (Reuters) to put an end to the linkages between their names and serious criminal acts to which they have been mixed and which have always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their wealth or both.
They have major participations in almost most of the world's central banks and prepare or wage wars against countries in which they have not yet had such participation (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after Iraq's invasion of 5, after the return of Kadhafi only 4, while Russia placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Everyone who has tried to stand up for this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew to the Bank of America of Rothschild the status of the central bank and began to issue his own money during the civil war (government, I understand well) and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to issue own money and wanted to dissolve the FED, he was murdered in 1963, and MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while he wanted to try a trial against the FED for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the world level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a 33rd-degree freemason, being the highest level.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to eliminate colonialism, in particular British, and the third was to reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), to create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing but the love of such a solution) and finally to acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with their heads the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then to propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are false and still lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF to avoid repeated crises such as those they caused in 1907).
After having managed to trigger the first world war by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, heir to Habsburg at the Austro-Hongro throne, they destroyed the Tsarist Russia by causing the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended suddenly with a German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the massacre of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier launch of the second world war, the bankers have allowed politicians to create a latent conflict situation: they have, on the one hand, imposed on Germany huge war repairs generating the conditions of radicalization of the apocryphal masses (they then have enough to place a sufficiently energetic leader, showing the finger of the guilty, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, create a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who was supposed to play the fifth column (which it actually does) to set fire to the forces and trigger a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of which aspires to the creation of a Jewish State, preferably in the region of historical Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
Balfour's statement mentioned above laid the basis for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on the one hand and on the other.
The second world war broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had initially held it; or if everything he had planned was, however, the fact is that the suffering of the Jews in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that war repairs imposed on Germany were at the origin of World War II, the foundation of the State of Israel lit a firehouse that could provoke a third world war.
If the international bankers succeed in launching this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the wars, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a vast laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country but internationally (just to see how people are clearly divided between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a wrong creates another wrong according to an endless circle of violence and where, in the beginning, we find the greed of some individuals and their desire to acquire power over the world?
There must be a difference here between the mere citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, like us, the international bankers do not offer people elections but their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of fascism politicians, loyal to international bankers, who do all they can to start a war with Iran, which could, because of its country's membership in Shanghai's cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) expand to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls Ormuz's destruction by which 20% of the world's oil transit (this naval corridor has a width of only 2 miles) and creates a destruction of the world economy.
In what light do the words of David Rockefeller now appear in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance are used by the rest of the human population.
A world in which everything new born is implanted at birth an electronic rifle that makes it completely controlled.
"Let them compel all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to wear a red mark on their hand or forehead, so that they can neither buy nor sell the person who does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood that the person who has good sense takes into account the figures of this ferocious beast.
This number refers to the man and it's six hundred and sixty-six."
The film Argo: when everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of protesters made up of Islamic students took over the American Embassy of Tehran and held 52 diplomats in hostages.
They were to be released in exchange for Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had supported his regime for decades.
The situation did not offer the US administration a positive outcome, and it could not, in fact, abandon Shah, because it would have seriously undermined the trust of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the release of hostages.
It was a hard blow for the prestige of the United States, even worsened later by the fiasco of the attempt to release hostages by force.
The sequestrian diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate in the United States sparks a wave of solidarity and an anti-iranan sentiment.
The Iranian debacle strongly contributed to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan at the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo, by the actor and stager Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offers a small victory to America.
Just before she was occupied, six employees escaped the embassy.
After complicated periods, they were found in the Canadian Ambassador's residence.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran by means of a rock cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a tour team to track a large science-fiction film.
Mixture of genres
Tony Mendez's exfiltration expert's plan requires Hollywood collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized magazines reported on this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company and office reals.
The details of the operation remained long secret, the film being based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several kinds.
This is part of a political thriller designed in a realistic way, but also a "movie caper", the story of a successful hit, of a betrayal - such as in Ocean's eleven, twelve and third-party trilogy.
Ambiances follow: the sequences of the documentary style Tehran (in the sub-strings there are iconic photographs of the time of events and the way in which, thanks to these photographs, these same situations were retransscribed into the film, there are no major differences),
the lighter Hollywood crossings, treated with irony and a little bit of exaggeration,
and then scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions with custom men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck managed to relaunch his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculous actor, he became a respected stage actor and his game as an actor stopped causing ironic remarks.
Argo is his third long-track after the police shadow " Gone Baby Gone " (2007) and the thriller "The Town" (2010).
It's also Affleck's first film that doesn't take place in his hometown, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of the atmosphere in Argo, where Tehran's role "is held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity, which also suggests confusion and unpredictability occurring when, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect in fictional scenes (the false tour team in the Tehran Basar).
Too many actions in too many locations
The stager had to be content with a subject offering only a few palpitating scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
It goes well, it sometimes adds some elements to reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is separated by a telephone blow in America and the pursuit on the landing track is quite pulled by the hair).
Argo's weakness is in its disposed nature, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
If it were true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood cooperatives, their characters would have earned a bigger place and that they are not, far away, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks some dramatic tension, it is shown with a moderate interest, appreciating the realization and style of the 1970s.
He drives the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a history yet, in a way, incomplete to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated nature of the representation of secret services as omnipotents and omnipotents, he does the case.
Rules for the swelling of balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public inquiry into the most absurd banking costs, has now decided to launch a competition for the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU is considering, in recent times, the adoption of a 40 per cent quota for the management of large European enterprises was at the root of our decision," said Pávo's journalist, Patrick Nacher.
Among the absurdities mentioned, for example, the recent European Court's decision to unify insurance premiums for men and women already exists.
To date, however, women have benefited from life insurance rates because they represent, objectively, a lower risk to insurance companies.
People can report by the end of the year any other incredible idea of "the EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013", Naker reported.
The contested EU regulations include, for example, the obligation to add bio components to fuels, which has harmful environmental consequences, or the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively low quantity of a dangerous substance or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which has resulted in an increase in egg prices.
Critics have also been issued in the past against the prohibition of the use of the term "tartiniser bridge" or the withdrawal of the sale of classical ampoules.
Quality bananas must be 14 cm in size.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually defended in Brussels by a State or a group of States (i.e. the Czech Republic currently imposes the requests of its banks by threatening to use its veto right).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, because in the Union bananas must not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal corrugatement".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was only harmonizing non-homogeneous national standards that complicated trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables have been simplified despite the opposition of some States, claiming that the existing directives result in a waste of food.
The first prize will be awarded in this survey in the EU regulation of last year, according to which a warning should be given on flammable balloons indicating that children under 8 years of age should not flammable without adult supervision.
The EU has referred to an American investigation that the balloons are, among toys, the first cause of the death of children by strutting.
A similar restriction applies to children less than 14 years of age for what it is to blow in fire trumpets.
We've got some weird ideas at home, too.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme to Greece, anyone who has an official role in the EU cannot use the name "Macedonian" and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Let us Make" bringing together liberal economists, the Bankovnípoplatky.com has appointed, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the Union regulation on the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes fixed for canned and risked mushrooms, thus a heavy fine.
The organizers of the survey considered it interesting to pay money to some countries because they did not have access to the sea and the idea to grant a grant to apply for grants.
These ideas, however, are not originating in Brussels but in Prague.
"The fact that we don't have a sea has a problem with us.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund." In autumn 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the Jaroslav Palas era (ČSSD) expressed himself.
It was argued that, because of our wheat production and following the "interventionists" purchases, the State had met with full stocks that it had then to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from ports.
Finally, the European Commission has responded positively to the Czech request and has organised a call for tenders for the purchase of wheat from countries without access to the sea.
Grants for grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development, led by Minister Pavel Némec (US-DEU), and were to be specifically used to draft applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU states: "Wonderful regulations are rare".
If the regulations often give rise to criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the efficiency of the Union's operation and in the area of its overall development are to be commended.
More serious, for example, is the problem of the use of EU grants for projects which have absolutely nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which were imposed by Member States in the course of budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other countries of the Union, is fighting in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (the fight which it does not always win) is a source of lively emotions in the Czechs.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs have successfully defended the name "Olomoucké voržky", for what is called "Tuzemský rum" that dates back to the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only cane sugar-based products, not beet sugar, can bear the name of rum.
The official list of products registered in the EU today includes cheeses worldwide known as the Feta or the Gorgonzola, the Lübeck Massepain or the Jambon de Parme, the cookies of Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary"), the carpes of Pohorelice et de Třeboný ("Pohorelýlý and Třeboný kakr") and the Žatec Žatec ("Zatecký chmel").
The pain of Pardubicý perník ("Pardubicý perník") and the gâteaux called "Cornets de Horíce" ("Horičý trumpety") can also be proud of their Community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Mr. Senator, what is the idea of presenting to the presidential elections?
It's not a senator or president who counts for me.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I would not be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the country has been pillaged for the past twenty years, that thieves are not under the locks and taxes and the age of retirement is increasing.
I didn't have the ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that doesn't please me, then I try to make a solution for it to change.
And as I am more than forty years old and as an independent member of either party, I have no other solution to influence the situation than to present myself to the presidential or Senate elections.
You entered the Senate but you were quickly set up for the Château (N.d.T.: Chair).
Isn't that how you turn your back on those who chose you?
I've always said that I'm going to be thrown into battle for the Château according to the results of the Senate elections
I then explained that if I had been elected senator, I would be presenting myself to the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, it is only an instrument that enables me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the widest mandate.
The problem is not only as a nation we meet at the bar or in front of our television station, but we also love those who are trying to bring about change.
This is added to the press that breaks the reputation of people and confuses freedom of speech with freedom of speech.
For example, I have said that I am subversive of journalists or that I have been the advisor of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's come to your visions.
You have begun the fight for Château with the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and tax returns beyond twenty million [of CZK] as a battle horse.
To that end, you have to change the law.
As President, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I was a citizen, I was pressured to make tourist guide activities a liberal profession, I got a cause.
The problem is politics: when someone comes to the left or the right with a good project, it is deliberately refused and it delays citizens.
As an independent member of either party, I have much more chance of obtaining the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and participatory dogma, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you rather consider yourself a man of the right or the left?
From a Czech point of view, I have the impression that people like me rather to the left.
For me, whether it's a little to the left or a little to the right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we go ahead.
What counts for me is not that people are left or right, but that people are gathered.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS, and I am also impartially opposed to bad ideas.
Are you angry when someone says you're a populist?
But what you said doesn't prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have an optimal purpose and a vision.
You're trying to get closer to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken about them.
But without Parliament's support, you only have slogans.
You won't survive long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will, for example, be able to impose material and criminal responsibility?
I have no choice.
I need to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to get them to my camp in order to impose it.
If I had been elected President, it would not be a problem to broadcast directly on television my request to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
Then they should possibly explain why they don't want it.
When there is a strong personality that will identify abuses, it will be possible to pressure the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the President to direct suffrage, which was obtained through the pressure of public opinion.
I'm starting to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I just started out in politics and I'm trying to get the support of the majority for my program.
I'm just trying to move things forward, and if that doesn't work out, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura was supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that one person cannot make the difference, so I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to present themselves also to the Senate elections.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported the research journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the frauds in the macho.
I was introduced because people are really unhappy, but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and what they did most of them gave their voice to a representative of the establishment.
At the Senate, we are only two independent.
People chose a Senate that could hardly impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the election to direct suffrage of mayors and prefects of regions.
Would you like to start your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have the time to check if the past of each potential member is intact and then I don't have the financial resources.
I don't have any more money for my presidential campaign, I have only twenty thousand on my "transparent" account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about tax statements, what's yours?
I estimate about 60 million the value of my personal property.
I have in Prague a land worth 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million, and a Skoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
It's been said, I own an Aston Martin because it was a boy's dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving in the car, was fighting with women and fighting evil and abuse.
You're in Aston Martin, you have a 60 million-dollar heritage and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don't want to invest your own money there?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I go?
I've already invested 2 million and a half in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my program is not of great interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign from my pocket.
My campaign costs are globally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live in it, for example paying my son's English school that costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to earn money, I'm not going to make a choice.
So you're going to continue your business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd put your activities in the background?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will take the management of the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
It's good I'm living with something, though.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I won and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.
You will find this interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper Práva.
The architects of the MVRDV firm prove that the true adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To be sure, it is enough to contemplate Spijkenisse and the newly erected book mountain - 2 photos
"I find this building boring, it makes very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby down the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computerist in a large nearby company, tells us, "Yes, it's actually nice, this building."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
Today, no one's going to go full-time in one of these fancy libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a town-dortoir that has nothing attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, has a quite special memory.
The municipality of 80,000 souls displays the lowest rate of education in the Netherlands.
In order to bring some neurons back to the brain, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of beautiful small, small, painted concrete miniatures.
The success of the cultural offensive has remained limited.
This is how the city's authorities realized that there was only one way to recover the hand on the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, of the architects' office of Rotterdam MVRDV, master of bold boat diagrams and creator of mind-filled and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with its usual flag and presented it to the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a reindeer on his face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking down, disillusioned and raised their shoulders, Maas, the faced, emplied his books of choice by size order to make a pyramid, and ended his staunch speech of activist arguments by one: "common love!"
Here's my proposal for the Spijkenenisse Book Mountain, or, as we say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros to land jailli.
The building is included in a revitalization project including a underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and mytoyen houses for a total of 50 rooms.
At the beginning of November, the bookstore received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is how this little black bourgeoisie, who so far had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a mare of a horrifying lazier, whose white façades invite to think they are opening a laity, has enriched itself with contemporary architectural work.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Path towards Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under cheese bell.
Of course, an elevator carries you to the heart of the massive, but the true joys of reading and architecture open up to you when you dig the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior completely made of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and the elegant reverbers speak without doubt the language of the municipal public places.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking at public banks, dogs and small boys and girls playing at the dance.
And everywhere books, books, and more books.
"Normally, library beams are located along the façade and in the middle is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," explains Willy Maas.
We have completely whacked the classical space configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain of books has been well-furnished: there are offices in the middle, the Internet library, the chess club, the environment center and the technical center of the building.
A special beauty is located in the black beams of the library, which are both lambs, and balustrades, and also the escalator ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of the solid building do not want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project with the municipality of Spijkennie, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found in an ad hoc agricultural waste in a farm.
In the Netherlands, the synthetic membrane of a millimetres thicker has been used for years as a substrate in the hills and fields.
It's a good market, and we get time.
The membrane end is used for one or two seasons, then you can throw it away.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, in addition to a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, the smell of which evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
On top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
At the end of almost 500 metres, the literary coffee offers us a stunning view of the city, but also of Dutch croquettes and pot ficus.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they contribute mainly to maintaining the ideal level of humidity in the air of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the new soul
"It's amazing, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model ecology project," Trouborst confides.
The temperature of the building is controlled by geothermal.
Although the mountain of books is below a glass bell, the sun only sheds light on the inside, even the days of good time.
The thick wooden poles mounted through the beams compared to the glass façade serve as a parasol, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The fully automated stores are dependent on the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned septic computerist, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there too.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even described Boekenberg as "the soul finally found" of Spijkennie.
A few weeks ago, during the inauguration, each citizen was invited to make a donation of a book from his personal library.
This measure made it possible to fill the voids of the library that was not yet completely garnie (now there are 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays are everywhere.
For architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has achieved the masterly discipline called "the creation of an identity" in the professional jargon.
Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history.
Even though she may appear young and uneducated.
This is finally a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role."
Germany chose to abstain in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the Palestinians' request to obtain observer status with the United Nations.
But then she chose the abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious, since it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think that she does not support the American position anymore.
Germany wanted to affirm its independence, however, without showing too much criticism of Israel.
During the insurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany also chose to abstain from the vote on the establishment of an air-exclusion zone.
Finally, NATO imposes this measure.
Does Germany find it difficult to adopt a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is revising its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so as to say defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans are therefore faced with several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they're still working on finding this role, but they're on the path of a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, such as in France or Britain
What, then, does the term "normal" for Germans mean?
It demonstrates the willingness to adopt independent positions of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national cases.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, so exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of other major powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected Germany's position towards the conflict in the Middle East and the abstainance in the United Nations vote?
First, Germany has important developments in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to offend the public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
There is no doubt that this is a decisive element.
However, I would not attach too much importance to this because it is not a purely unilateral relationship.
But this is a decisive element in German strategic reflections.
Does Germany sleep in its relations with the United States by opting to abstain in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think that Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I think the fracture is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected.
Germany thus demonstrated that it should be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests should be taken into account.
In Europe, the views on the Palestinian initiative are varied.
On the other hand, the United States announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do the views differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences due to the American domestic policy scene.
I believe that the Obama administration has shown a great deal of understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot, of course, defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences in opinion are not so great that they always appear.
If you observe the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahou, you will note that Obama is far from enthusiastically addressing Netanyahu's policy.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don't think that makes things easier for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not the case.
They cannot therefore join a broader political line and must affirm their individual position.
This is what they are currently doing in the euro issue.
In my view, Germany will take a locomotive role in the future and push Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This issue has always been sensitive.
But I believe that the Germans are well aware of the fact that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany play a role as an actor of weight on the international stage, and does Germany only want to play a key role?
Or is it always difficult to take on the role of a plan?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still experiencing difficulties in playing a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we note that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
This does not make things easier for the Germans.
In fact, this is still the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It must be made up of very diverse neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy only decreases, but at this point the EU does not fill this gap, so who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if they don't like it, and if they're less appreciated, it's life!
Stephen Szabo is the deputy director of the Washington Transatlantic Academy, an institute in which university students and political experts in Europe and North America analyze together the challenges of the transatlantic community.
Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specializes in German politics, American foreign policy and transatlantic relations.
"Mark Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are famous brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is this really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially filed in China, but it has nothing to do with the original company.
The brand thus enjoys protection such that the company that bears the name cannot bear complaint.
And even if she could, he's not sure she'd get a cause.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," explains Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing's office, in violation of property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new file comes on my desk.
The simulators only need a few additional letters to be able to record their marks.
Thus, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci is recorded, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is recorded.
German companies are also legally copied, like Puma, the manufacturer of sports articles.
Pattloch opens a classroom in which are the recordings made at the Beijing brand office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company filed the brand Zenga DF Puma, a name that the company artificially created by fitting part of the name Ermenegildo Zenga, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become champions of the world of copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities, there are commercial centres on several floors that sell practically only counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: his mandate is to attack the fact that the Chinese brand office officially confers on Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese are talking about "Bang Mingpai", parent brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
In this sense, women who marry rich men are designated.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," Pattloch says.
"The brand is sweet, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is huge."
The financial losses and the costs of justice are estimated in millions for the sectors concerned, especially as regards the cost-effective products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, China represents, with an annual volume of EUR 15 billion, the third world market for luxury products and the fastest growing market.
However, it is not easy to root out the suspicious registrations of the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
These may last for up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reported the proceedings in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period, the critical term had become "the reality of the market".
Pattloch tells us that if the complainant is not lucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarism, because he would have damaged his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Celebrities also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the manufacturer of Sany construction machinery, the same company that just bought the concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That's why the Chinese can use a symbol that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, the Volvo buyer, used a blue and white logo to remind him of BMW. The conflict was settled and Geely had to change it.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost against the beachmen of Hong Kong and Singapore who had reoriented the view of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the office of CTMO brands in Beijing admits that there were some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the office would have passed the last year of an "emergency situation in the course of the work to a normal finding".
Thus, the number of untreated opposition procedures would have decreased by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 cases of this type would have been closed, which represents an increase of 75 per cent compared to the previous year.
However, 81,500 procedures remain in the office.
Cost action
As often as in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, this is a record and this means that China is for the tenth consecutive time in the head of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office would have accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration rights.
In other words, each registration reported an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euro.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarism.
Of course, the Germans were able to obtain suspension of the illegal manufacture of vehicle components.
However, the simulator was able to maintain its Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
"It is our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany," explains Hanno Wenzler, president of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities Directorate in Munich.
The brand office had therefore rejected the municipality's objection.
Freudenberg has certainly won cause from the following two instances, but the opposing party continues to fight to this day.
Caution is to be exercised
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of the judges.
However, he adds: "The procedure is long, trialsome and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs. The archive service has even had to review the past 100 years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed to the opposing party a "large sum of six-digit euro" in vain to settle the dispute.
"That's what we see that represents for us," Wentzler confides.
The dangers of the Far East threaten even to dive into Europe.
This would be the case if copyists in this region would ensure the operation of unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to deposit in Germany the name of Freudenberg for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but it could still prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "watchmanship is a must."
Pattloch and advise German companies to show great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, according to them, to rely on international trademark law, that foreigners should rather "register all that is likely to be protected in China", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, costs can be much more important than those of recording.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the battle during the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay licensing rights to the adverse party for the use of its own name, as explained by Wenzler.
Or, then, we will lose our place on the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: foot tap, sing, help
The Imbongi choral repeats in Heidelberg, and the orphans of Swaziland's AIDS rejoice with their arrival.
Here's the story of a link that broke much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, we tap the foot: cowboy boots, basketball, women's scarves and men's mocassins are looking for the rhythm by hitting the ground of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers are slowly amplified - high, low, tenor and soprano - and they are carried out, laid out and followed.
Trust Hopf, the 29-year-old orchestra chief almost loses his shoe shoes when he runs the orchestra with his gestures of a wild flexibility.
We are Monday night, the choir Imbongi repeats a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology of Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years of age came from genetics in human medicine at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each chorist has different words, all in a very exotic language: the hall, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some regions of Swaziland.
Help to Help
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is seropositive.
180 orphans from the village of Esitnije village found parishes in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary education institution.
For 15 or 20 euros per less, we can become sponsors.
This amount guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a hot daily meal in the gogo center.
Imbongi means "historic content" or "sanctioner of praise".
No one can speak the Bantu language properly in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, the choir has been repeating songs in this foreign language that she has brought to Germany to now bring her to her home region: South Africa.
Because at 8,733 kilometres by flight from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esiteni, which depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of persons affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest huts of straw or land, and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, as HIV has taken their parents.
In Esitni, the worst-scale disease in Swaziland can be observed: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population virtually never accepts male circumcision, a measure which nevertheless guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection of half.
More than 40% of Swaziland's population is infected with immunodeficiency virus and it is not rare to die in the mid-30s.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village. Imbongis had seen a number of children in the street with whom he not only lacked parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school degree, there is no prospect of any good.
At first, it was just a few people who personally committed to spending a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to school and offer him a warm meal a day.
But only a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has been taking care of almost professional orphanes of the AIDS of Estinie.
Sexually transmissible infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial ISTs are syphilis, chlamydiae and lennorrhagia (or gonorrhae).
Current ISTs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Pubis and gale bags belong to parasitic ISTs.
What are the main groups?
Syphilis and bennorrage are often seen in men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute believes that sexual contacts between men are at the origin of at least four syphilis cases of five reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, Chlamydia infections, trichomonase, candidiasis (fongic), lennorrhagia and the human palillome virus are sexually transmitted diseases.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher rate of Chlamydia-related infections than in other population groups.
According to European reports, the three quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15-25 years.
In addition, in Germany, the human palillome virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to declare all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases was more than doubled in 10 years: the figure went from 1.967 in 2001 to 3.698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscess at the level of genital organs, urinary pain, white loss, lower abdominal pain, and the appearance of buttons and glasses.
However, they do not regularly experience any pain or other symptom and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Preservatives may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason is that pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or by close physical contact.
The experts therefore recommend that any person who often changes from sexual partners to regular exams.
Most of the fast-disposed ISTs can be cured and the late sequences can be avoided.
Thanks to the sponsorships, the gifts, but especially the funds collected by the chorists through their voices throughout Germany, the funds accumulate.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjenje," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman who is sure of herself and who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well-inhabited, at one of their grandmothers, for example.
The gogos, that's what old women in the hall are called, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them receive up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and ensure that they go to school every day in their uniforms.
The orphan who has no one else is welcome in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has established a cooking school and has allowed the construction of two chickens. With the support of the American organization for PSI health, the association has organized a HIV testing test for many inhabitants.
This is not for itself, because although the disease is very visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A King and His 14 Wives
"The AIDS is a real taboo," explains Annette Lennartz, "because it's a subject that touches sexuality."
It is quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These measures are, among other things, responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers also spread the virus across the country.
However, there are condoms at every corner of the street, Annette Lennartz adds, "but almost nobody uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to promote a little cultural exchange, Imbongi chorists travel together every two or three years in South Africa and host songs filled with nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many people at the point of the Black continent still know of the time of apartheid.
The bus full of whites singing in African is a sign of recognition such that it not only creates good mood and joy, but sometimes also raises a tear to a few redoutable border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitni, where the chorists visit their daughters.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitni is well known in the valley of Ezulweni.
"Go to Esitni, you'll find light," the people said there.
And after a trip of 8,733 kilometres by flight, back to Heidelberg, in front of these choristes who are closing their feet in the repeat room of the Bergheimer Straße, we also find light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger survey reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could reach 20 meters thick.
The US Space Agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published this Thursday in the special journal "Science".
The Messenger survey has reported evidence of the existence of a ice cover in the region of the planet constantly dimmed in the shadow.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters that can go up to 20 metres.
Water probably comes from comets or perhaps asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one connects the discovery of water with the hypothesis of a life presence on the planet, explains the scientist in charge of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other vital elements of life have arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Unprecedented inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which we observe the infinite.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the planet Naine Ceres.
As Pluto, orbiting around the Sun behind Neptune, Cerès is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the international astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Telescope Spitzer shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue and the most difficult points to identify are the "new-born" in the universe's docking room.
Telescope Spitzer discovered this region where the stars are born, baptized "W5", a very little romantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopée, at 6,500 light years.
NASA's Spitzer Telescope photographed the flashing spark of a star in the process of dying.
The ring-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star designs when it dies.
In the immense nebulous trifide, 5,400 light years of Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
Telescope Spitzer has photographed this galactic docking room.
The Pleiades, star lovers also called "the seven sisters", can be observed in the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope adds more value to the colors.
On this infrared photo, Helice's nebuliser, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light years in the constellation of the Verseau.
Its similarities to a continent of land have valued the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and the infrared photo allows you to observe a spectacular tent.
Only infrared detectors of the Telescope Spitzer were able to capture a picture of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest enigmas of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving traces.
One of the largest and clearest photographs the Hubble telescope took is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
According to the tent, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the Australian Observatory shows the nebulousness of the Trifide in the Sagittarius constellation, to several thousand light years.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three dust strokes divide the heart from the place of birth of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the assumptions of a cosmic carbulage in the constellation of the Serpentaire: at 400 million light-years of the Earth, the cores of two fusion galaxies rush one towards the other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the M83 spiral galaxy.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "Australe Fire Wheel".
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the Iris cloud in the constellation of Céphé.
The nebuliser is located at 1,400 light years and consists of dust grains that are ten times smaller than the current domestic dust.
This photo was produced from optical and radiographic clichés taken by various telescopes.
There you can see the circle composed of black holes that are at 430 million light-years from Earth.
The Space Telescope has photographed for NASA this group of baptized galaxies Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula there is the group of young stars the brightest of our lactated path.
The celestial berth always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Nebulae of the Rosette, are also constantly creating young stars at 5,000 light years of Earth.
In this galaxy with light rays and pierced by a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists believe that he was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope would have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not ceased to grow and thanks to them, it has been possible to see more and more in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale Telescope of Mount Palomar near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Large Binocular Telescope is located.
It allows you to observe the universe through two mirrors each having a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Grand Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, the Canary Islands, is huge. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 metres.
The Mirror of South African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
The diameter also reaches about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also located at the vertical angle.
Its particularity holds to its great ability to collect light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is closer to those of the world's largest mirrors telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe looking for extra-terrestrial signals using the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) radio telescope.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any person who owns a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extraterrestrial intelligence") by contributing the calculation power of its machine.
View on the Australian European Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("Very Large Telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can shed light on the medium infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European Telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of nearly 1,000 pieces of mirrors.
However, the telescope will not be able to take any clicks before 2018 as soon as possible.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They'd build two mirrors of a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory that monitors the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new giant telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and its mirror diameter will reach 30 metres.
This illustration allows you to admire him.
However, images of the most important space come from Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been giving us pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for exoplanets, mainly those that are inhabited.
NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space as soon as possible in 2018 on board an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
In particular, the telescope will have a mission to find light designed by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the South Pole of Mercury is also covered by ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole of Mercure.
Radar data have been indicating the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In South Azerbaijan, many people reach a decent age of the Bible patriarchs.
There's even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country where we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
In South Azerbaijan, many people reach a decent age of the Bible patriarchs.
There's even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country where we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
The trip to the Talysh Mountains is a failed romanticism.
In the area of many road tours, the small bus cahots along wooden hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, we would almost believe in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group named Talysh lives, about which we don't know very much, unless they speak perfectly the Persian and the Azeri and they have a very longevity.
Terminator: Let's go.
The small town of Plastron with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era, which does not agree at all with the landscape of picturesque mountain.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Bakou, is too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel 323 kilometers, because the road has only one path.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48 years old, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
"Baku has become famous in May thanks to the Eurovision competition, and next year, there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva explains.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum of luck in the world.
We can discover the life of about eight decades of Talysh from the region that is over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white photo.
Here's my grandfather, he's at the age of 120.
Keeping a child alive at 136 years of age
But the controversial star of the museum is Şárali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no act of birth.
And when it is thought that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, the age of Müslümov seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would still have conceived a daughter.
Şirali Müslümov would he be mistaken for a few decades by calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a generalist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard of the man at the great age of Central Asia.
"An amazingly old person also lives in certain regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," explains Scholz, "also in Sardinia, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish a scientific evidence due to the absence of documents, although there is no registration of civil status.
Every day, a glass of deep butter
However, it is true that people in the region of Lerik often reach a worthy age from the Bible’s patriarchs.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
What, then, is the reason for the longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that the Thalysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks it's a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that food rich in calories of the Thalysh, which likes meat, bread and especially dairy products, and which many drink daily a deep bottle of butter, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of people? In Cengemiran, a small village near the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as is typical of seeing it throughout the Caucasian region.
It sits on the ground next to a barber, which it beats the contents unbearably.
Eight people live here under one roof, one of the sons of Mirzayeva and one of the daughters, who have been adults for a long time.
Two little children also chew in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests serving in typical bottled glass in the form of a belly.
The white teeth of Mirzayeva are perfectly aligned, and under its furrow they hide themselves from a long chest of dark blondes that his son proudly reveals to us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I never lost them and they've kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo," adds Mirzayeva.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes, and small peas.
All my life, I've never bought the least food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after World War II.
But everything improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the orders.
The language of propaganda is strange in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the worship of the fatherly figure of the nation, a man who, however, ruled his country as a dictator, knew almost no limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham succeeded him afterwards.
Whatever the case, the elderly in Azerbaijan are not aware of the distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 mandates per month (about the same amount as in euro) for her retirement, an amount that guarantees a good life train in the region.
And perhaps the son of Mirzayeva has been grinning for a long time: "the elders enjoy great respect in our culture."
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "human rights" neglected in the Constitution
The revolution is reinvigorating in Cairo.
rival manifestations reveal the country's deep fracture.
The draft Sharia-based constitution is highly controversial.
The Egyptian President does not have words filled with emotion.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was directed to the whole people, but especially to the Christian Coptics, the liberals, the enlightened Muslims, and the secular.
Because all the confused and desperate members of the opposition are afraid.
They were afraid of a theocracy on the Nile at the hands of powerful Muslim brothers.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost by apologizing, that he temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended his "to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer wants to save, a doctorate of the American University of Southern California.
Will the judiciary be reversed?
The 234 articles drawn up in the autumn by the majority Islamic assembly of 100 people on a five-hour night force tour are indeed disturbing to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
That was and remains an interpretative question, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use the vague formulation and the margin of legal manoeuvre resulting from it to apply a stricter interpretation of the charia.
In any event, a newly introduced article provides that, with regard to all matters relating to charia, al-Azhar University must be consulted. The institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its radiation on all the Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative system, which would in fact lead to the enforcement of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are in the field of interpretation
Another problem is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Moubarak, these courts used to oppress the opponents.
After the dictator fell, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also, perhaps read in the project, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that State institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Clearly, it would simply be censorship.
Moreover, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibits insulting or slandering the prophet Mahomet or his envoys.
However, the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished.
All too doubtful is the wording that makes it clear that it is forbidden to "hate people".
Is it enough to draw the president's caricature or to tell a lie to the detriment of a man of law?
Many points are therefore the subject of interpretation in Morsi's draft vote, which, according to his own words, will be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The Revolution Retinues"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the digital superiority of Islamists.
On Friday night, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in an unusual agreement on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to get the charismatic before it enters into force.
"The revolution is renaissance and we're going to win," launches Hamdin Sabbai, the third at the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El Baradei, said that the draft Constitution is "to be thrown into the trash of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi's partisans of wanting to promote a "putsch against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and reverse it," says Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet exhausted," said Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a political man and a member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges have announced that they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
On the other hand, the well-organized Muslim conference called for a counter-manifestation not on Tahrir Square by precaution, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized before Cairo University.
The veiled women and the supporters of the Salafists, who participated in it in great numbers, were in a scandal: "The people demand the application of God's law."
"Clean our country!" they asked Morsi, saying that "the Qur'an [was their] Constitution".
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic place Thair, where everything began, would soon have brought about a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that's what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that opponents to the draft Constitution, as well as its participants, had expressed themselves highly and strongly.
According to them, it is now time to allow the people to decide by the timetables of the direction to be taken by the country.
The Islamic project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this constitutional process that should have extended until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHR) had defended the Muslim Brothers when they were in prison or in court under Moubarak.
He did not do so because he shared their concept of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That's why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with the World am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are intimidating to the rules of democracy and will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto withdraws all his powers," said Saeda.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda is left behind, including the international community, who looks at the battle between the various political ideology on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
That could be paid.
A protester on the Thair site warns: "You'll hear from a monster that you won't be more able to control."
The rake of Norway: is this the most smelling fish in the world?
The five million people who live in Norway have one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the appetite of locals for an extremely smelling fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and salty footwear.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's most captured spots.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, imprecises the air.
The rakfisk consists of salt-washed wheat and fermented in the water for a period of time - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to one year.
When the darkness sets up and it gets cold, the Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival that took place here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw food, then you take a glass of water," says Havard Halvarsen, a local full-time fireman named "Rakfisk General", responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people take advantage of small pieces of fish and fill a large amount of wine.
"Some people prefer the aquarium to rake," Havard adds.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid getting it under your nose, it's not bad - it makes you think of a sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of the refrigeration, the fish was immersed in water bars in the air, then salted in autumn.
Then, during the winter, once well-fermented, the fish came out and - no doubt with the senses of alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their countries to find work, mainly emigrating to the United States.
Currently, the population is rapidly developing - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a full health system.
The Swedish, their old rivers whose country was not so rich as Norway, cross the border to come to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital element, although smelling, of the past of Norway.
This comes from the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not to deplore it.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right extremist racist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they mention this murder, they speak of "the incident of July 22".
The Norwegians find it difficult to accept that in their peaceful countries, one of them had been able to commit such barbaric acts.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has had its wealth in its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason that justifies our success," explains Anna, our servant, to the blonde hair and to the eyes of a transparent blue, the image of the Nordic well-being, with a rakeboard at hand.
We are - as you say - prudent people.
His English, like most people living here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not want to make any comment.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with a lot of caution - everything, with the exception of a low percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries threw money through the windows, during the years leading up to the international financial crisis, Norway managed to keep the lines of its well-closed stock exchange.
"As long as we can ski in winter and make the date in summer, we are happy," Anna says.
"Don't forget the rakfisk," she added in an insomniatous laugh.
I'm standing under the snow and I'm making the tail to buy me what to eat - I've had my dose of rakfish.
In the menu, a hamburger made of wool, a true discovery, it's excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel in which I stay is one of many places where we use rakfisk to eat and where we can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most smelling of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a noud-papillon, surrounded by rakfisk seats.
We would believe in the Eurovision competition.
"What score did you give to the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"Here are the points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls out of his chair, maybe because of the water abuse.
Or maybe it's because of fish emanations.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto knows a difficult departure.
While the President comes to Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take up his duties in Mexico, Will Grant of the BBC, he is interested in the challenges that await him and the expectations of the people, which are many.
Road traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at present.
In a city where bottlenecks are legionate in normal times, a security barrier has been set up since Monday, blocking several key roads in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the objective was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidency to become the new president of the nation.
It's a complicated task waiting for you.
Mexico's economy is well on track, with the result that the president is forced to leave Felipe Calderon, but the country is in favour of a drug war that has already cost about 60,000 people in six years.
"My Government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Pena Nieto told American President Barack Obama in the Oval Office a little earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before joining the U.S. president, Mr. Pena Nieto was the governor of the state of Mexico.
A very populous and tentacular state that includes the capital. On its ground of predication, the views on this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolique municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
Locals are responsible for the development of tourism and infrastructure in the community.
To join the city, you can take one of M Pena Nieto's new motorways, an important improvement has been made to these roads, once been forested and full of bushes.
A new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change have been added to its name.
"We count on him to put in place sustainable changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of Congress and M Pena Nieto's party, PRI.
In terms of security and economy, in particular, we hope for a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years without failure, the PRI was defeated in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The member of the Olvera Congress admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the criticism of opponents who reproach the new president for lack of charisma.
He is an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a great man of state and, above all, he can listen.
However, it is not always the image of the people of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more flagging.
Hidden under the highways, it is, in many respects, a banner of the city of Mexico.
And problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, the military were called to the rescue to fight drug gangs in the neighborhood, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a troubled area, dozens of women were murdered in the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a sadly famous place for the number of innocent women killed there.
The detractors of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that, at best, he failed to address the problem of the murders committed against women when he was in office.
Unfortunately, they accuse his administration of refusing to see the reality in the face.
In a concrete house, typical of this decorated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold her tears when she shows me pictures of her dead daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version reported a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says Mrs. Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and the body rigidity had already begun.
While his mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana wears the wall, next to a cross where the word appears: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family has been denied.
The authorities treated me like I was an old man, a troublemaker, a pulverizer.
They want us to accept what they say and to rest.
"But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives her discharge on Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to do so during his term of office.
"I hope he will be as good as President as when he was governor," Olvera, in Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress, said.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about ill-treatment, the prosecutors said.
Prosecutors are trying to counter claims of ill-treatment that Bradley Manning would have been victimized during detention.
The trial deals with Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants to classify the case on the grounds that Manning's kidnapping took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of having demolished thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to prove on Friday that soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of being the source of the greatest leak of confidential information from the entire history of the American army -- had many opportunities to complain of the ill-treatment he alleged had suffered during his military detention.
During an interview with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney Maj. Ashden Fein said that weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints about his treatment.
The counter-questioning -- during a hearing, the defence filed a request requiring that the Manning case be classified on the grounds that the sequestration took place under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified to his desire to commit suicide during his detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, was accused of having demolishing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning had been their source.
During Friday's hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms that the officers had completed after meeting with Manning during his detention in Quantico's military prison, where he was subjected to a maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked questions in Manning and gave their answers.
When Fein mentioned the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment he had reserved for him was "excellent" and that the treatment he had in prison was generally "very professional."
The forms did not report any complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers had directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about certain problems and that the officers in visit had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they had not identified the problems mentioned.
"They wrote "no problem" (after addressing the concerns), and yet that did not mean that I had not raised any problems," Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the Special Committee meeting to address the suicide thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to amend his restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury".
The military stated that they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below the close surveillance for the risk of suicide -- for the protection and safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was going well, and I wanted to get rid of this status... in order to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Corps des Marines base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had planned to commit suicide when he was in Kuwait and was evaporated once because of the heat.
He added that the fact that he had not been kept informed of what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very disturbing.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arajon, to this cage," said Manning, Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in this cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning stated that he had spent the clearest of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only objects he had were a mattress, a cover, tongs, clothing and its glasses.
He tried to stay in motion, because sleeping or staying away during the day was contrary to the regulation.
Manning also specified that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards didn't see his face when he returned at night, they would wake him up to see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge also asked Manning questions about an alleged claim in his Thursday testimony -- that after having been forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stay naked in front of guards and other detainees one morning during the call.
Manning testified that at no time, he was not allowed to cover himself with a cover during the call.
During the judge's questions, on Friday, Manning stated that he had withdrawn from the order of his guard that he had to throw his cover that could have hidden his nakedness, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to throw it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep the night before, because he would have tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning would have told the officer that he could have used the elasticity of his slip or tongue to hurt himself, but that he had not.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his tongs, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hoped that at least the judge would take into account the experiences he had experienced during his detention and that he would significantly reduce his sentence if he was to be found guilty before a court of law, a trial that should be held at the beginning of next year.
The defence stated that Manning was planning to accuse the least serious crimes and to fight for abandoning other burdens considered too extreme.
The hearing should resume this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was imprisoned in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
The charges brought against Manning include the theft of property or public documents, the collision with the enemy, leading to the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information on national defence.
If all the accused's leaders are detained, the criminal prosecution will be called on forever.
My Mexican-American identical crisis
He says that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
The Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind the Mexicans of the difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says the Mexicans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico, arriving in the hall, in front of customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two ways: one for the "Mexico" ("Mexico"), one for the "Externan" ("foreigners").
I remained real for several seconds, not knowing which file to lead me.
I grew up in the center of California, where my name was called "Mexicoin" all my life.
This is an ethnic qualification, the same as the one my friends in Boston use when they call themselves "Irish", or my friends in New York when they call themselves "Italian".
Then I became "Mexico-Americain".
But, here, it was Mexico.
And, on the earth that my grandfather was born, there was no need for special qualifications or union.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, enough to manage an interview in one language or another.
But I don't have an Aboriginal vocabulary, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and I went to the "foreigner" file.
I thought at that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama, House-Blanche.
Generally, when leaders of these two countries meet, their predilection themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risk themselves in the United States.
He wants to go to the United States and Canada, and create a Union for trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to pursuing the war on drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide any more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and bitter.
Most Americans have probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to hand over half of their territory in writing to the point of the gun.
But for the Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as an official U.S. makes the least criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear complaints about the way American people are affected by the sovereignty of their neighbors -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites.
And the kids in Montezuma are looking for the trunk.
Yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is what the country has with the more than 35 million Mexico-Americans living in the United States.
Do you want us to discuss the subject of bitterness?
There's a lot of it.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them.
The only reason that explains the great number of Mexican ancestors in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at a given time, in our genetic tree, a person, perhaps a parent or a grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person corresponded to a typical profile -- a dark skin, little trained, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we now live the American dream, that we went to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live, and not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes disturbed, but our loyalty is obvious.
We agree with the United States.
Moreover, we know that some of the Mexican elites in the ruling class don't like us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them of a humiliating defect and they burn us as if we were individuals of lower origin and not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our relationships with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not find ourselves stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who legally emigrated to the United States while she was a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexicans, because Mexicans are more firmly claiming their identity and Mexicans are against them.
Although she is an American citizen, she has the feeling of being part of two countries.
In addition, many Mexican-Americans I know do not have the impression of being part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican group, Los Tigers del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are viewed as Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some intelligence want to get closer to Diaspora.
They want the Mexicans to work as fortune ambassadors for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a great country that must absolutely visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much love.
And if we consider wage inequalities, corruption and drug-related violence that are omnipresent, many of us are not convinced that it is a fantastic country.
You're going to have to take care of yourself, friends.
It's normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexicans still want them in the way that members of their families have been treated for not long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old queer, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood transfusion seems to indicate that such hope is vain.
While the same vain arguments persist to know who started, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and for the first time, rockets from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to be stuck in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full swing.
In the Arab spring, all of which had been stolen into cracks, and whether or not it was stolen, the Palestinians and the Israelis were caught by this regional disturbance.
Maybe their fight will intensify a little more.
However, there are every reason to believe that this could help them get out of this mortal impasse.
A war that doesn't make any losers or any winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to prove optimism.
Even if the ceasefire granted on 21 November remains, this week's struggles have strengthened the parties of the force on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has led Gaza since 2007, will be afraid to have forced the Israelis to give up, even if Gaza has been driven away.
Having killed some of its leaders and returned the 1.7 million people in Gaza in one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the world, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining land in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently at the hands of their Fatah rivers, the other most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a regional power in full, once the Muslim ally close to Israel, took root and cause for Hamas; like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
The members of Hamas rejoice and say that the growing Islamist moves around Israel, from Lebanon, to the north, where the militia of Hezbollah exercises its dominion, passing through Syria, where the Islamic tendencies can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And the most important, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of Muslim brothers under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, far from the most populous and central Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim brothers are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders make it easier for them to return to public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor that will no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
During this time, Israel’s hard line participants will draw the reverse conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was put in a box.
Iron Dome, the baptized missile interception system, proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelites will be able to sleep on their two ears - for some time.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unbreakable support; and many European countries have blamed Hamas for being the source of the last wave of violence.
Above all, however, Israel has prospered, particularly under the Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who has completely ignored the peace process.
Although Gazan rockets have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by suicide attacks, including the separation barrier that hit the West Bank, the main piece of what might be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish colonies that continue to spread despite their illegal international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, of whom the Likud party merged with an even more belligerent party, the leader Avigdor Lieberman in the nearness of the January 22nd election, has the beautiful part.
Why do these Palestinian records fail by giving them a state?
If they were leading the West Bank, wouldn't they launch rockets like their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is preferable to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they get out of their heads.
Maybe the partisans of the line will take it; but the Arab spring may change the woman.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere appreciate little Israel, their priority will be to address the problems in their own countries.
The defence budget of Israel is more important than that of its four Arab neighbours.
Starting a war with local superpower will not help the new Arab governments set up their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire that is desirable -- and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a force that is dedicated to one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel-Aviv this week.
The repression has already weakened democracy in the Jewish state, and democracy exacerbates this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bleeding missions against Gaza every two or three years to sound Hamas will have a diplomatic prize.
Both sides need to be pushed by those outside.
The answer remains the one proposed by the reasonable persons on the one hand, and most of the outside world and by this journal: two states, with an Israel's security transfer.
A hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will give external people the opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now seek to put an end to the arms movement towards Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs of foreign countries should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to join.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the next proposal of a pseudo state to the United Nations.
Mr Obama is also interested in what Israel accepts to negotiate.
During his first term of office, he did not present his own plan of peace.
Returning to the White House, it seems as reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This is through a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws for packages of neutral cigarettes enter into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick organs cover the dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of the brand
This law entered into force in Australia is a world first, logos and colors were replaced by a dark olive green and horrible pictures of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases were caused by their parents' smoking.
Outside the various photos and health warnings, the only difference between packages since Saturday is the name of the brand, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the world's strictest tobacco packaging regime.
The Australian federal government stated that the aim was to deter young people from smoking by eliminating any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before the age of 26, there are 99% chances that they will never start.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message carried by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies that revealed, for example, that children associated the crown of a logo with a princess."
Although Australia records the lowest rates of smoking in the world and if these changes have little impact on the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has put pressure on this law.
Tobacco manufacturers have stated that this would relaunch the black market, which will make it easier to access less expensive cigarettes.
"The adverse consequences will come from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre, of British American Tobacco Australia.
The fakers in China and Indonesia will sell much more counterfeit cigarettes in the streets of Australia.
Others stated that this law had dynamized their activities.
Sandra Ha de Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for cigarettes, especially in silicone, to mask the horrible packaging, has greatly increased two months ago since British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost before the high court in Australia.
He said that Zico sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is waiting for stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only nuisance, the experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population segment targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising, sports sponsorship and the obligation for dealers to dissipate cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Web by local companies and sites, but it cannot prevent foreign websites from doing so.
"If you are working on tobacco marketing and you have no more than a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the indispensable place for excellence," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of some lambda citizens to social media brands such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves if this is a mere citizen who worships Marlboro cigarettes and who is given the penalty of making a video, or if it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry focuses on the new regulation in force rather than marketing.
The industry went to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new decisions of justice - these countries told WHO that trade was unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries had significant trades with Australia.
A WTO decision should be made in the course of 2013.
Plibersek said that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make the package warning photos mandatory in 2001.
At present, these warnings are presented in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The pictures don't bother me.
I'm ignoring them.
"You take a cigarette and you rank the package," said Victor El Hage at the time of buying a package on which a picture of mouth tumor appears.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna get arrested is my little daughter.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack Tobaccoist" in the centre of Sydney, said that the uniformity of packaging made it difficult to arrange packages on the stands.
"Before, I needed an hour to download a package, now I need four hours," Yu said.
"The government had only to ban them for a good time and we would have said OK, that's good, we stop and put the key under the door," he added, raising his arms to heaven.
In a world that is constantly connected, it may be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I've had enough time to think about the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending a half-day at an airport to wait for a flight is rather boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to entertain you (without forgetting duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts specializing in the development of the child commend the nuisance.
It's perfectly normal for us - and our children - to worry about time in time, they say.
This forces the brain to borrow interesting ways, or even feed creativity.
And as we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of nuisance.
So should we welcome the nude with open arms?
Yeah.
And not.
But I'll be back.
First of all, like many people, I thought that boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But that is not the case, says Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek-Roman History at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The nest rises very far," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin graffiti that evoke the nest, they rise in the first century.
Then there is the definition that we give to the nuisance.
The problem is that he has been defined and discussed in various ways, said John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After spending a lot of publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined the nuisance as an experience that is "to want to do something, but without getting into a satisfactory activity."
What distinguishes the nuisance of apathy, he says, is that the person is not doing a task that she would like to do.
With apathy, he said, there's no desire to do anything.
What is in the heart of the nuisance, he said, is "the interruption of the process of attention, associated with a lousy mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
Nausea can be very much like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if both of them can be connected, people who are experiencing it tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we get to think that we're bored when it's actually a concentration problem.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experience in which participants listened on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard from the next room that it was too high for a TV broadcast that had no reports, others just heard TV broadcast, and the third group didn't hear the band sound at all.
Those who heard the TV at a low sound level said that they were more concerned than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but they didn't know why, and they attributed this problem of concentration to the nuisance.
When you try to concentrate on a difficult or demanding task, a interruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate neuroscience professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do a boring task, "like looking at objects on a mounting chain, music can help you not to be bored."
In fact, he says, at present, we know that when we are tortured or being taken, these gestures, often considered as signs of boredom, are in fact a good way to stay physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to gigotare learn more and hold more information than those who are forced to stay without moving," said Professor Fenske.
We are all bored one day or the other - the delay of my flight, a speaker with a monocret voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "Scaling Predisposition to Nursing" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, "Some of the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous", and "I have so many centres of interest that I don't have the time to do anything."
Using such a scale, researchers have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular they need numerous and varied incentives.
In general, however, adolescents are quickly praised.
In 1991, Reed Larson, an individual and community development professor at the University of Illinois, conducted an experience in which he contacted nearly 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 per cent of adolescents reported being bored at school and during their homework duties, while 23 per cent reported being bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, three percent of the parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said that he did not know whether today's percentages of anxiety, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adultness is a period when the nuisance reaches its highest level", especially because children and adolescents have little control over what they want to do.
If I ask my question, is it good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, to make payments or to abuse certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have referred to a link between nuisance and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"The anxiety is the way the brain found out that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology in the United States.
But the brain doesn't always know what the right thing to do is.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't learn to take care of himself or self-control, says Professor Fenske.
And "that's legally going from one situation to another," he says.
Your child not only learns to enjoy himself, he gets more control of himself in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify the nude.
Just as I don't think we should criticize him anymore.
To feel at ease outside the constant bubbling that generates activities and technology is the goal to which we should tend.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
"We need to worry more often, but the nuisance awakens an acute and french desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate the time to stop.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated," he added, "it's hard to find ways to get into something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no directive for the new law on marijuana
Anthony Orozco, 19 years old, studying at a college and football player in Colorado, is accused of something that will soon become legal in his condition: the possession of marijuana bubbles and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and some friends were on board a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found Marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a quote to compare possession of drugs and materials that could serve his consumption - minor crimes, each accompanied by a fine of $100 - and a date of comparison.
"We are treated like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he one of them?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado's vote to legalize the consumption of small quantities of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than on the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana were immediately classified.
Police services stopped indicting adults aged 21 and over for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will enter into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's most conservative districts have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to accuse the people who own them.
At the same time, several cities from Denver's flags to the West mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana sales in their neighborhoods.
"The things evolve so quickly that I don't know what the future holds for us," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of the Aurora police, east of Denver.
The government's regulatory bodies in Washington also have no problem with questions.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a permit system, allowing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the date of delivery of 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether it is veiled or not, is in progress on most of the regulations on marijuana, first of all regarding the use for therapeutic purposes and now on personal use.
"The Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson for Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Mr. Smith admits, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real past on which we could be based," he said.
The Washington Act, called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a legal void of one year, during which the licensing system will not always exist, while the possession of marijuana will be legal.
During this time, practical issues remain pending: how to balance the state mandate that ensures proper access to the approved marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales in a 30 km radius around a school, park, playground or crash.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to install an approved cannabis sales trade, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson of the Cannabis Legislative Centre, a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, the chief of the police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City of Atorney" (representative of the public ministry) would no longer pursue the people of 21 years of age and more who had small quantities of marijuana, and that the police should stop indicting people for this kind of "immediate" crime.
Chief Oates stated that the police would apply the new judicial decisions governing the activities of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, North Colorado, the "attorney district" (Procurator of the Republic), Ken Buck, incarnates a narrower vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with the possession of marijuana, mainly in order to pressure the users to get away with it.
At present, 119 people are accused of having 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are subject to other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to try to prosecute these people who committed an offence that, at the time of the facts, was a recognized offence," said Mr. Buck.
The reactions were complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative for the limited consumption of marijuana.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer compare adults to have limited quantities.
The representative of the county's public department, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to order all Marijuana detention cases without delay.
"I don't feel like wasting my time continuing to apply the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of Colorado voters supported the measure, offering an appropriate legal and government framework for the personal consumption of marijuana is not easy.
And the conflicting reactions that have been observed in various American cities highlight the profound ambivalentity among local officials with regard to the legalization of marijuana.
"It is a cultural barrier" with representatives of the public ministry, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the people accused of using marijuana and who speaks as a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They spent a good part of their life pursuing in justice the people who consumed marijuana, too, have trouble accepting it as legal," he said.
As the first states to deal with the limited consumption of marijuana at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are becoming a case of case-law for the legalization of drugs.
While the state's defenders and representatives are planning a new legalized sales border, they look forward to the federal government's directives, which always design the sale and culture of marijuana as federal crimes.
The defenders of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will resign.
Despite some mediated arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and sellers, the federal government has mainly allowed marijuana sales for therapeutic purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
If it is true that the police are probably not going to get the doors to grab small bags of drugs, there is strong evidence that they are opposed to the approved sale of marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado did not expect federal authorities to act.
Before the polls, some local authorities approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana sales, even if this was only a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a moratorium of 6 months, and should impose this ban next week.
"We do not want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then face a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than in the vote of the State.
A lot of questions are being asked.
Petronella Wyatt: I was abused and excluded from Oxford because I was a "tory" (conservatory).
They are not only students today who are attacked for their opinions.
So far as I remember, I always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and my older brother studied in what was an excellent place for me to know, a kind of Greek amphitheatre of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I was installed at Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to make my suitcases, causing the first scandal in my life.
My father fell apart and went to cry.
My friends were disappointed.
L'Evenning Standard newspaper claimed that I had left this university because I objected to the fact that first-cycle students had sexual relations in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson said with pleasure that I was going after being forced to drink in broken cups.
The truth was less funny.
I'm gone.
Yes, I ran away because I was a victim of intimidation and subjected to constant bruteness.
Not because of my rather alien name, or because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one and only reason, and in this so-called berth, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my sorry father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I was part of the Conservative Party.
Why do you say that today, you'll tell me.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of centre-right students suffers the same kind of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford was such that last week, some of them claimed protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
The conservative members of the Student Hall (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College stated that they were "usually isolated, attacked personally and were undesirable" because of their political views.
They want a representative in the University Committee for Equal Opportunities to be able to express their views freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent documentary released on BBC Two "Wunderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The Country of Miracles: Young, Smart and Right"), devoted to student politics, and which identified the "Tories" as eccentrics and neonazis.
Among other things, the student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who moves in Rolls-Royce, takes a completely silvered tree and moves with a chromed head cane.
In other universities, conservative students say to be treated as emission loops for the introduction of higher education costs."
Luke Black, 20 years old, vice-president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, said to a Sunday newspaper "that there is a left-wing party in the universities.
People think we're like Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old, who studied history in Corpus Christi, who proposed a movement for more protection, said that such a climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, president of the OCA, said that there was a deterioration in the attitude of the members of the JCR towards people who are centre-rights.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate and to the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one to think about that during my first weeks in Oxford.
I came in September 1986, I was then 18 years old and a paralysing shyness.
The hatred of the conservative party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted in favour of Margaret Thatcher - an old student - an honorary title, due to the reduction in the funding of higher education.
The atmosphere was charged with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the reception week, when the new students got acquainted with the others and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen next.
I found that not only did the teachers participate in sarcasm with the Tory students, but they also enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy on gross minors, the privatisation and opposition of the government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa were being set in the wood of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm I was victim to was a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now dead), "Please translate the first paragraph"
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a little man with a pussy face, took it easy.
"Is it that the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears were burning my eyes.
"I suggest you take French courses during your free time - at last, if you're not too busy making friends," he started out of your rage.
I'm back in my room, uncomfortable.
During dinner tonight, I sat alone and felt a slight tape on my shoulder.
He was a second-year English student named James, who was introduced as a member of the OCA.
"I know who you are," he said, politely.
I'm afraid so.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservator) is taken for a target.
It's already hard for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most Tory youths claim to be workers.
Later, in the local pub, I tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagree with all that Mrs Thatcher had said.
This strategy has failed.
A first year student of philosophy, political and economic sciences who had ironically studied in Eton said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students picked up the refraction.
I was a pervert, man.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They hit each other, don't they?
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I just live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people sharing the same views only after the fall of the night?
Should I become a Labourer and renege on my opinions?
The next three years would be like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only open professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was a consultant in Thatcher's foreign policy and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as his accession to the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a position as a professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started making the shuttle between Oxford and my parents' house in London, finding refuge with my family and friends more open to the mind.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He was unbelievable.
During his studies in Oxford, in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dreams bells.
Even my Communist friends had irreproachable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Leave them a chance.
I'm sure it's for you to bite.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
I was tired of my frequent trips to London, and my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and gave up his convictions.
During a work session conducted the following week, when another history professor suggested most seriously in the world that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do so.
Singing in shame, I admitted to being the victim of the brainwashing of my parents and the treatment of "old mad".
The repeat was short-lived.
It's my father who buried the last brick of my Oxford circle.
At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed carpeted in my room, and after five minutes, my persecutors left.
When they left, I made my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I've never been back.
You can treat me with pleurnichard wet chicken.
But no 18-year-old child should be subjected to such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic thing is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 first ministers of Tory, but also benefited from an unmistakable reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety "
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Couture", opened this week in London, ABC questioned Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian curator customers.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth Ire of England, is the only place in the British capital to welcome an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The tailor recognized it at the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", a prestigious retrospect that brings together over 130 models of high leather created for his cooking home in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his incredible Italian accent.
This exhibition is the organ of a story whose only protagonist is "the master" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until 3 March, there is an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the aristocracy cream, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as the trophies of his social rise: from the modest tailor of the city of Voghera, north of Italy, to the icon of the international jet set.
There's nothing wrong with loving the kingdom.
"At least they don't burn their cigarettes on your beautiful tape as some pop music stars do," says Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to his Gstaad chalet," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of past beauty like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentine's Model
The Argentine Mannequin, Valeria Mazza, has not forgotten the charisma of the tailor.
A few years ago, after a show on the Place of Spain, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, every guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the week of the Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995.
"It will never go fashion because its creations are works of art," she concludes.
Nobless Line Display
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but shared love.
He loves well-high people and with the greatest titles and they love him too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamour podium of sixty meters wide that proposes to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the mannequins and has to parade on the podium to admire a "public" dream with the main creations of Valentino, like the size that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his marriage to Aristote Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti wore in "La Night", or a wool coat and fur belonging to the emperor Farah Diba.
Among these are men's audiences, names such as Sybile de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria or Sophie de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the cooker in 2006
Many of her clients say that Valentine's first clothes are like the first love, "unforgettable to forget."
I remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a "gillette" and a dress from the 1971-1972 autumn winter collection.
"It's a gift he gave me," said Naty Abascal, one of the tailor's museums.
"I prefer him to everyone else for his femininity, his great love for women, and because he subjugates our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I love the colors he uses, they are bright and they brighten the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashionist Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg can't forget the first time she brought a Valentine's model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of her evening clothes...
Finally, this was possible at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first model Valentine for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward of Line.
It was a red evening dress, with a wheeled jumper, a worn pocket and a drop-off.
"It was a dream that became a reality," said Rodrigue d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with imporole," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg retains the night clothes of the tailor with "the greatest care, because a night dress is not only a dress, it is also all the memories she carries".
The "king" of fashion
The great end of the exhibition by Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress, which took place during his marriage to Paul de Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (the tailor calls his cooks) to make this silk dress with pearl incrustrations, twelve kinds of different teeth and a four-metre-and-half-metre train.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the high cooking of the late 20th century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
For years the "know-how" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavalier del Labouro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated by the Legion d'Honeur, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of its clients' wives.
"His refinery, his calmness, his caring and perfect appearance have always missed me," says Arenberg.
The last time I saw him, it was a month ago for a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, years had no effect on him."
If it's a princess who says...
The hardest job in the world: Kawah Ijen's human dead
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by carrying 70 pounds of sulphur through the paved stone paths.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of 400 minors who earn their lives by bringing the sulphur of the Kawah Ijen volcano to the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day until the bottom of the crater, where the sulphur gas from the ground drains to the air contact.
After harvesting large stones of sulphur, which weighs almost 70 pounds, he installs them in two bamboo panes that he loads on his shoulders through the steep trails.
There are only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano, reaching 2,386 meters high, but the exhausted carriers put more than 40 minutes to burn this distance, at an ally of torture, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipitation.
They know that a mistake could cost them their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who fell dead in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The Kawah Ijen minors earn 5 cents of euros for each kilo of extracted sulphur.
Once above, a path is broken between tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and with painfully heavy banners, they walk 3 kilometres to the balance that a mining company has installed a little counter at 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960, and it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian clothes (5 cents euro) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells 10,000 rupees (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry, as this miner is very present in everyday life and is used to manufacture candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten the sugar.
"As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) each trip," explains Anto, who generally makes three trips per day.
Each takes 3 hours and ends exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a misery for such a surhuman effort, it is the triple of what he would gain in the fields.
"The income of the minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167)", says the carrier who used to work as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6,20 euros) per day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason which, in Indonesia, is as uncertain as the suffering: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her back to Java for her conversion to Islam."
And suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, constantly, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27 years of age, he spent three of his life exposing the danger on the Kawah leen, but the suffering has already begun to make him pay the bill even though he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
And suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, constantly, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases emitted by the volcano.
It's the price he has to pay to continue his dream.
"I am going to work for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French" he promises in more than acceptable English.
Misleaded by life, this nice and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a server or a receptionist in a hotel, but instead he's doing the job of a dead man.
It shares an insanity of wood with other bearers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning, because the suffering does not stop jollying at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and bright in the middle of the darkness.
Defending the darkness, Anto went down to the crater by lighting himself with a little lamp fixed at his helmet, that he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 bearers are charging the ashes on their shoulders from the bottom of the Crater.
Despite its comfortable benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extract of sulphur to save costs and provides no equipment to the carriers who work on their behalf and are paid to the weight.
In addition, they no longer touch one of the 30,000 clothes (EUR 2.50) of the increase by photo equipment, in addition to the introduction of 15,000 clothes (EUR 1.20), that the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for animals, not for humans," protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old corporate who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he left college.
He can carry up to 110 pounds, he ensures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the pain damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind spins and traps the minors in the thicks of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so intense that no one complains of suffering serious diseases... to which their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and shoulders are obviously added, distorted by the weight of the pancreas.
By balancing the basket on its back, Unainik, 53 years old, can only charge 50 pounds.
Every day, his companions and they extract 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometres from there through a trail of goats invaded by the bad herbs.
"I will not take my retirement, I will die here because the volcano is all my life," Unainik says by opening his mouth, revealing several missing teeth.
His five-year-old daughter, aged 30, also works as a sufferer.
Time passes, but the eternal misery of generation is one of the most difficult occupations in the world: the one that makes the human morgues of the Kawah Ljene volcano.
Singapore Baby Search to Save the Economy
Singaporeans place responsibility for this absence of children on the career, stress and the cost of access to property.
"The population of Singapore must develop."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, we fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unmistakable that these words come from an advertisement for pastils at the mint, but despite this, or perhaps thanks to this, the video spread as a powder slide on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The words come from a rap group that uses local references like "Then put a polychinella in the trigger" to wet Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency from the source of the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said that he wanted to use the power of music to make people perform their "national duty".
It is intended only for the Internet, so we have been able to make it fun and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the world's worst in the field of birth, so we feel that it was a theme that we should address.
We knew that the government had tried a number of things such as launching perfumes on pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we are saying the following: what is more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song?
1.2 children
The Government of Singapore does not take it so lightly.
It spends $1,300 a year in politics to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favour of marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, lengthens maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservativeism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered to be the rate of renewal, was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the marriage and family policies of the National Population Division, states that it was due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life and priorities beyond marriage and the establishment of a family," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of singles and to delay marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter population decline has created a sense in the local population.
In Singapore, there are web sites that abound with a deviant xenophobia against new immigrants, especially Chinese who are accused of pulling wages down and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore last year experienced its worst election results since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the drop in the birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities began to control the number of small apartments, known as a shoebox, which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage the promoters who want to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the real estate company EL Developers, claims that its "shoes" sells much faster than larger housings.
They are more popular, in the sense that these buildings are built much faster than those of the largest size.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our treasure.
However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer instructions to the promoters, who had previously been put in wheels if they wanted to offer too little housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
So if these new regulations could be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, discussing with Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre, it would seem that they are not going to have much effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are expensive, like education, so that's why people give it back later," says a young framework.
Other people may have children.
"But for me, it's important to be able to have my money and my time," says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their career, stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons for preventing them from having children.
Thus, although the government tries to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to babysitting, Singaporeans themselves have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy, it is the quality of the private domain or "the privacy domain that we can protect from any intrusion".
What does this involve in the private domain for at least 16 years?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to by spreading online events that he would certainly not be sharing offline?
The ElPeriodic newspaper interviewed five young boys aged between 10 and 15, frequent users of the canvas.
In four cases, they have associated the term "something very personal" with personal and "password and user name" when applying it to social networks.
"I will not disclose my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years old when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them, but not everyone," he says.
On FB, I put nice pictures or games.
I'm also talking to my friends.
"I won't share one of my photos or anyone who would make the fool," he said.
The young boy recognized that it was wrong to publish obscenity photos, naked persons, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge ensures that he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine subscribers on Twitter.
Most of them are family.
Her mother, in fact, knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them," he added.
"The social networks are fun, I can talk to distant parents or my friends quickly," he said.
He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
He will not trust anyone who would recommend a foreigner.
The case of José, aged 14, is different.
The adolescent has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people on his list of friends.
"That doesn't bother me because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the young boy, no one has made any progress or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If they put me pressure or demanded it, I'd just delete it from my account," he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today under the name cyberhark are not foreign to the young boy.
A close friend of mine was hacked into a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who he was" he made sure.
The victim, according to José, didn't close his account.
"He only passed it in a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to set up his account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I would if I was angry or angry.
"Even though I know it's cyberharkment," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a professor of English and licensed in Education and Learning, believes that, in order to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a way of looking for information, but, with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, who has a master in education at Yale University and author of the book "Naturals and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives, they are children and young people born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we are learning ourselves," she said.
It adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what to disclose, publish or say to an age where they do not have the maturity necessary to do so".
"We also ask them to be selective when what matters most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences" she added.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach confidentiality to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think.
"Don't tell them to do it is useless," she says.
Then, Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to post a photo of you like that of a friend you published?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
When you identify photos of parties, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing every minute?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do offline.
Those are the same rules.
"On the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, that must be the same on social networks," she said.
Surveillance
Esturdo Guardia, university professor, primary institute and education adviser, states that it is essential for parents to read the conditions of use of social networks consciously.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have solid bases to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to be shared or published," he said.
According to the Guardian, it is essential to remind children not to speak to foreigners.
The Unasur Summit ended without the release of the Lima Declaration
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) has now ended in Peru without the release of the Lima Declaration, although it has been announced previously and theoretically adopted by the 7 current mandates.
Efé tried several times to access the document signed at the Sixth Regular Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency reported on the start that it would be disclosed after the closing of the summit, and then stated that it would be published from time to time on the Peruvian Government's website.
When they were questioned about the text, they reported that its contents had been presented by Peru's President, Ollante Humala, during brief press statements.
Journalists' access to information on the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, audio restricted" was broadcast in the press room.
The few information circulating among journalists was given by the press officers of some of the Governments of Unasur who attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only paper released during the day was the list of the present presidents, which caused a certain malaise among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who claimed more important information.
Later, the Peruvian Presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not of the official document that concluded the summit.
In October, Peru was the host of the 3rd Summit in South America (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although this was requested by the press, it did not disseminate the statement also called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official ASPA site, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In the two international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to establish safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited the information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court which runs a different border between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, met at the regional meeting and stated that they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear the complainants from both sides in the trial that Lima had attempted against Santiago and which began Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes we have before this international court today," said President Humala, next to his Chilean counterpart.
"Cili has always been, and will continue to be a country in accordance with international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts," President Piñara added by handing over to President Humala, next to the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the IGC took place after Colombia this week denouncing the Bogotá Covenant by which it agreed to submit to the decisions of this international court, following a decision on the maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered to be gravely wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 following the resignation of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was tasked with opening discussions in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The mandate officer read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been established between South American countries for a total of $17 million of investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he noted that the countries of Unasur would put in place "significant steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of residence permits agreements".
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "co-operation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions to improve drug accessibility, access to the Internet at low prices throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With a crisis Europe, "the economic consolidation (Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and create a better future for our populations," said President Humala.
"We have decided to favour a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of South America spaces, particularly in rural and border areas ... by joining our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian President at a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were about Peru and were on the transversal axis of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aimed at a more important connection with Ecuador although it had not given any more details.
The final document also mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process of this country will allow its reintegration into the Union of the South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another theme discussed at the summit.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico to discuss the maritime dispute calmly through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We are going to review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the Treaty with Nicaragua, which will call for a discussion with this country," he stressed.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will settle this in the most civilized and respectful manner possible," President Santos added.
The Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they planned to attend the presidency of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
In the same way, in the context of the summit, the Minister for the Defence of the Block will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of the Unasur, although the latter is suspended.
Peru provides the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," says Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which "South America, in this case, should be an example of Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the VIth Summit of the South American Union (Unasur), located in Lima, said on state television, TV Peru, that Europeans "were interviewed during the Second World War" and other conflicts, "but they were now almost a country."
In this regard, he defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of the Unasur.
"There must be free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactive areas that we want to be part of in the past," he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President has shown support for the re-establishment of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who reject our ears never compromise anything, on the contrary, we, the South Americans, have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa ensures that he does not regret his decision, because he has not betrayed his own principles, but has, on the contrary, respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were suspicions that Assange would be extracted to a third country and that its trial would not be respected".
In addition, he criticised the Swedish justice who demanded that he submit to an interrogation on a alleged sexual offence in his territory, while "Swedish legislation allows it to be done by videoconference, which could have been done since the Embassy of Ecuador in London".
Korea stated that there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't talked to him since he was in our embassy, but the embassy informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian president.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being trapped in a small space without being able to exercise freely.
"This is about the health of anyone," he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy of London, which would be the allocation of a non-conductive conduct that would allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities and stresses that there has been discussions in London in order to find a solution to the tightening of the WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a series of procedures with various European bodies," he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain agreed to the only conduct in the morning, it would end."
And if Sweden, as it fully permits its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, would question Mr. Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, or would question him through Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be resolved.
Correa took advantage of it to reaffirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press and stated that what he would not tolerate was "the mediocrit, the evil faith and the lies that harm freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not evil or perverse politicians, but bad journalists at the balance of greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this regard, he welcomed the fact that this is not the kind of journalist "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than putting forward his re-election, "it would deepen the revolution to pursue the path and follow the right path".
Korea has also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in the Unasur until at least the next elections, arguing that the organization "should stand firm and not tolerate the opportunism and attempted coup d'état" because, in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the Ecuadorian President considers as "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgement of the Hague International Court, which will strengthen the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.
For the time being, this judgment is not respected.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to advance together.
They need to be resolved together to go beyond them and go ahead.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the correct resolution of the dispute concerning the maritime borders that opposed Peru and Chile in the same court and stated that it was "beneficial that Latin America would seize the international courts if both countries agreed to accept such a firm judgment as it should be".
Referring to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate for future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to challenge a third consecutive mandate, he noted that he saw this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although it was sometimes rather difficult".
Korea has ensured that, if it lost its primes in February 2013, it would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as those in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be solved by means of political power.
"My political movement believed it was me that guaranteed this possible victory but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last presidential mandate and I will then withdraw from political life.
If we ever forgive, I will, too.
"It's my decision," he said.
Korea also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just discussed with the Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolas Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment had already been planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a rejection of President Chavez's health status," he commented.
The Heads of State of Ecuador today participated in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the South American Union (Unasur) which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
The AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the test was confirmed: seropositive.
"It's as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the moment of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "the least painful", in vain.
The young man hid it in his family.
He decided to take care of his illness and began to learn about it and his commitment was so that he had just celebrated his 43rd anniversary.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the civilian hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), in which he met in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s, where there was much doubt, little choice of treatment and more stigmatisms.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided telling him to review "because he was without a voice".
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, despite their disease, many still arrive when the virus has already caused harm, "expulsion" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first cases reported, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said HCG's HIV unit chief Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he points out that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The HIV/AIDS infectionologist and expert Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a fatal disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of immunization that patients had at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who did not use drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 rate of 200 and up to 50 years for those who reached a rate of 500 CD4.
Simply speaking, this means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis at 25 years of age, "as long as he remains under control, he will be able to live without problems until 75 years of age", the researcher explained.
In order to replace this progress in its context, we need to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
If there has been a significant decrease in mortality in recent years, in Mexico, the number of AIDS-related deaths increased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the annual report of UNAIDS), but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of the patients identified on the national database have died.
Nothing but in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there any more deaths?
I don't think the problem comes from access to treatment.
That's what I see, that's what happened in our hospital.
Over the past 12 years, we have never lacked medication, the problem is that patients arrive at very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or then they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine patients on ten arrive while they already have an opportunistic infection, which is necessary to have a greater impact on overall mortality, it is more early diagnostics and, for this, it is necessary to propose mass testing tests for all people who are asking for it."
Specialists and members of the Council of State for the Prevention of AIDS of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as well as patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to do their screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and that, despite his youth, he was already a carrier of AIDS and suffered from the sarcoma of Kaposi, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Any change when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it's better if I wake up three times a week," they say, that's not my case.
The change was beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.
To this day, his parents know only that he suffers from cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the march of the World Day against AIDS.
Whether they do the test, if they take risks, they'll know sooner if they're seropositive and better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in this year 2012.
Preservations on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, journalist of Guadalajara, who embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest is in prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms before we were given one or two, now we are giving them hundreds of packages, it is very good, but as a result, that today some still do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do about it?", asked with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents don't want to hear, ensure the journalist.
It proposes to reorient this ineffective distribution; that condoms not only be sold to accountants, but that they are found in the distributors of public toilets and in places where young people attend.
This is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it any more to pay the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had replied when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"It's not like sexuality works, it's best to provide condoms to those already sexually active," he stressed.
The figures in Jalisco
13.435 cumulative cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The State is the 4th State of the country in the number of new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th for the number of HIV patients.
92% of the contaminants are sexually transmitted, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, as there are 4 or 5 people who do not know it for each recorded case.
A judgment ratified by a U.S. court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt through a commercial failure in Mexico. The scenario has caused an adverse precedent for all national corporations with branching in the neighbouring country and with solvency problems.
It would therefore appear that the survival procedures of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country to the star banner, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the trial rendered on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the North Texas Branch Court, leaves Mexican companies without defence against the possibility of taking up their properties beyond Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow the principal glass manufacturer of Mexico to enter the United States Supreme Court on the basis of three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge of the case indicates that creditors must register under the United States Failures Act, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, located in New Orleans, states that the main proceedings are the formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would be to denounce the cooperation of international proceedings in cases of insolvency of undertakings with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law on the Uniformity of International Trade Law had been established for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the inter-society vote recognized in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts contracted by Vitro's subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro's case is not the first to use this plan.
There are about half a dozen examples here, including Agrex and Commercial Mexicana, including the Federal Institute of Commercial Failures.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since the votes of the subsidiaries remained, in all ways Vitro creditors who fought against it in the U.S. courts, i.e. the "empty" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 votes to 37.
A data omitted by the appeal court.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he has faced since 2008 without stopping from the serious economic crisis facing the United States, which has cost the country.
For the moment, the González Sada family will appeal to the same appeal court for the vote to take place in its entirety, that is to say with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The appeal of assurance will require non-property and requires a review of the case by a higher court, in which case the United States Supreme Court of Justice.
The most serious thing is that the court ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the curiae amicus ("friend of the Court") in which Vitro detailed the proceedings under the Trade Falties Act, noting that it would free him from the conventions signed by the two countries to put it at the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Falties Act.
It also notes that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules for cross-border insolvency, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Carabolage of two parts: they absorb Vitro and they absorb the country.
General budget
The complaints from the unions of the Mexican Aviation Society against the former patron of the company, Gastón Azcarraga Andrade, have been brought to silence for several months, and this was accused of fraudulent administration, and the Association of Aeroplane Drivers has already encountered problems.
The case, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal application against the National Banking Commission and the Values that is accused of obstructing justice.
According to him, the inspection authority has systematically denied providing information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw from the F/589 trust commission from Bank IXE 198 million weight on behalf of Mexicoa de Aviación.
The funds would have been used to purchase shares from the Professional Office of Hotels.
As everyone knows, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're watching Dragon Mart.
Meetings at the end of the week in an amphitheater at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colosal center of sale and distribution in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean products of the large wall country, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had succeeded in bringing together the governors of the South-East zone to oppose the monumental project that is in part on protected areas and represents the largest of all the threats to industry.
ACTA is dead
The Government has put forward a requirement of the Senate to explain the terms and circumstances under which the Ambassador of Mexico to Japan had signed the Anti-Contrafaction Trade Agreement, known as ACTA's English-language seal, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already of ancient history.
As everyone knows, it has been well done that the Senate itself has condemned this possibility, because it was considered a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term homex
In order to pay long-term debts without affecting them in the short-term, the real estate promoter Homex launched itself on the market of the Stock Exchange for 500 million weights.
This issue of securities is the first of the four issues for which they propose to pay interest every 28 days.
Birth of Competitive

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes "The basketball is my whole life"
The "Hetin" Reyes World Cup World Cup winner has spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to him, has traveled all over the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of the local basketball as large as that of Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before brain hemorrhage does not condemn him in the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes has been immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of lower leagues, player of the national basketball team, manager and leader of the national team, BSN, with the Bayamón Vaqueros or as president of the basketball federation.
"I carried several caskets in the basketball all along my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, director general of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," Reyes recalls at a visit to Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"The basketball is my whole life."
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that remind him of his journey out of standard, testify to it.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he loves most are those who remind him of his transition as a player in the Vaqueros team in the mid-50s to 1982, after spending 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team.
"That was my best years, those I've enjoyed most because I've had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
This has made many years of satisfaction, including the five championships that were held between 1971 and 1975.
I then retired from the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead in the team," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who was in charge here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a hard player for you, he measures two meters.
Do you want it?"
It's like at the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gauss, who was naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gauss was going to help us try to win another one.
He enjoyed the Vaqueros Championship with Gauss, but only at a distance since he was already the great leader of the federation in 1988.
At that time, he would rather take advantage of his duties and those of Mincy in the national team.
I recall when we first won it in the United States at the pre-Olympics tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived 4th and where we would have had to win the bronze medal if this Canadian judge had not made us the last match, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Team the best national team you've ever seen?
It is one of the best, as was the one who beat the Dream Team during the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is the Pan American Games of Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and that we raised the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won the bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colon and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Qujote" Morales, who could not attend the 90th world due to a knee problem.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament of Neuquén in Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner in replacement of the players suspended by the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we won gold against all predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
No doubt, it's about Piculín Ortiz.
Its statistics at the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level as did Piculín.
And that doesn't take his trajectories into account in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I love the work that Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest success in the federation?
It was part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season in the early 1990s.
What are you still doing?
There are things I would have wanted to put in place, such as regionalization of the categories of minors.
For example, Ponce boys play only in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island at national playoffs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when this is not necessarily necessary.
At least I have seen the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and arbitrators.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I watch videos of my time on YouTube, I enjoy my little kids and, from time to time, I attend basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy my wife's company, Isabel, which has always been on my side.
actor Larry Hagman's death
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became known worldwide for the main role of John Ross Ewing, more known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he had a man of business without scruples, redotable and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil magnet without screw J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of avarice in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year to J.R's role in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday night of complications of a cancer, according to a family communiqué sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., the production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his dear home town of Dallas, playing the ironic role he loved most again," the family said.
Larry's family and his close friends were with him in Dallas on this holiday in Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who interpreted his wife's role in the original series and later, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, reported his press attachment, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and I'm going to miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he lived a deep life," Gray said in a communiqué.
Doctors had diagnosed a liver cirrhosis in Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had recognized that he had been drinking a lot for many years.
In 1995, he had been diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the liver and had suffered a fever.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had become familiar with television in the role of a regular type in the series "Jinny of My Dreams" broadcast by the NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In this, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and brought it back to him.
He also played in two comedys that remained in the antenna for a while, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among its roles in the cinema are the roles well received by the critic in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterly interpretation of the deliciously disgusting J.R. that Larry Hagman knew his greatest success.
The drama series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and their neighbors were released from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to entertain the suspension around a full episode of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, has generated speculations around the world and millions of dollars played in betting.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record of hearing at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made Dallas the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s beautiful sister, Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot him.
J.R. had pregnant her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people also had reason to attack her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and unsatisfied man but with charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and a unfaithful wife who tried to internal her alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what it would take for J.R as a epithea for," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "What about the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
Here's the only part he's lost.
Victoria Principal, a co-portagonist of the original series, recalled this Friday of Hagman as a man "great, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each of us, who have had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were released a few months ago with a great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes has already been completed for the second season and a sixth is in progress, the chain has been informed.
For the moment, neither the Warner nor the TNT chain have communicated how Hagman's death will be incorporated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth in Texas, he is the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who is familiar with classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave her the day in 1931 while she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on the scene of New York theaters in the early 1950s and served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
That's where he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelson and married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he titled his memories "Hello Darlin': Talll (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': J.R's impeccable memories)
"I didn't write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect him in any way," he told the press at that time.
After his liver count, he became an active organ donor militant and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist the troubled patients.
"I advise them, I give them confidence, I come with them when they come to work and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer them some comfort, like "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it'll be fine."
He has also been a campaigner against tobacco and has participated in several campaigns.
A "End of the World" course has just begun
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
This semester, when religious professor Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was throwing an irresistable hammer there: the end of the "great set" of the Maya calendar, December 21, to which many refer as proof of the end of the imminent world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what was expected of him during the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax haven that some have nicknamed "Armageddon of Debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian theologians at the end of time thought that the apocalypse would trigger.
"I didn't realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," Professor Charmé told his students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and that we report it, it was a very good time.
And remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in apocalypse.
And he's not the only professor to give courses on "the end of the world" this semester, which in theory will be the last one in history.
At the Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vucker graduated from the "Media, Culture and the End of the World" course.
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and climate warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could explode.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared to examples of real life.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vucker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania State, the Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant Professor of History of Art and Anthropology, have teamed up to give a course, simply called "The End of the World".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, if the world would not disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the State of Pennsylvania, the final examination will be carried out on the watch of the Apocalypse, which will not leave students of other choices than to work "until the very night of the supposed end of the world," Restal said.
Courses have become quite popular.
"It was completed in two hours," said Restal about his course for high-level students, composed of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the beginning of the semester, on the part of people who asked if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It impresses me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves," says Bridged Robinson, a 23-year-old religious student and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden University.
Because the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or of lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Infirmary, claims to have seen all apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a course that taught this subject," he said.
I like it.
But none of the students questioned, and yet less a teacher, told us to believe in the end date of December 21.
"Our first project was the Mayan prophecy, and in a way we discredited it," says Julie Zegle, a last-year student at Temple, aged 21 and originating in West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world, it was only a key date on the calendar, said Restal.
But I agree that there is anxiety about apocalypse in Western culture, dating back to several centuries, which makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused some of these speculations.
"In other places around the globe, people don't think about it," he says.
It's mostly the Anglophone world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who gave courses to the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that there were courses here on "the end of the world."
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception from a superior authority.
We have a grace of the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years, many dates of the last judgment have been mentioned, and he states that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will start to think immediately about the next date" or philosopher on 21 December that marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date slightly.
Several have told us that they were thinking of going to parties "of the end of the world."
"Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student in communications.
