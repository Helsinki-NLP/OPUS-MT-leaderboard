Black box in your car?
While America's street planners are struggling with the lack of wealth to repair the damaged Hayve system, there are many people looking at its solution in a small black box, which is perfectly fit on your car's dashboard.
This device, which tracks every mile driven by the motor driver and transmits that information to the authorities, is now old enough to fund the major roads of America and has become the subject of a controversial effort for the Washington and the Kingdom Planning Office.
In general, hive plans, such as routine work, have become the point of deep debate and living relationships.
The miles you drive, and possibly the locations you drive - and then the government has joined the libertarian environmental groups to allow you to use these black boxes to provide support for the use of this information.
The tea party is delicious.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Association is also very concerned about the issues of confidentiality.
Although Congress could not agree that it should be done in the future, many governments are not waiting.
They're looking for how they can go into a system in which the driver will pay for every mile on the road.
Thousands of motor drivers have already taken the black box for the test drive, some of which include GPS monitoring.
It's really necessary for our country.
"It's not the subject of being chosen by us," says Hans Icharata, who is the executive director of the Southern California government, who is planning to start every mile set by motor drivers in California by 2025.
There's going to be a change in the way we pay.
It's professional to do that.
The main reason for this is that the country's High Trust Fund has become almost a devil, whose supply is paid by U.S. citizens on the gas pump.
The Americans don't buy as much gas as before.
Now the car in a gallon gas already runs more miles.
There was no increase in federal tax in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Because of the high value of gas, politicians are afraid to increase a tax.
Transport policy expert Lee Manich at the University of Minnesota says, "Gassing is not entirely acceptable."
Their government has recently put a tracking device in 500 cars to test the anti-military payment system.
They say, "This will work as the most reasonable option in the long run."
The Wons call it the Miles-based user shell.
It is not surprising that this idea is pleasing to urban donors, because it can be changed to make changes in driving patterns, for example, which can help reduce steam and reduce greenhouse gas.
California's planners are looking forward to this system while they are developing strategies to meet the goals set by the state's leading Global Warming laws.
But the president of the Home Transport Committee, Rap. Bill Schuster (A.P.A.) also considers the black box as the most conductive long-lasting option.
The free sellers in the Regen Foundation are also on the side of the Mile payout by the driver.
Police vice president Adrian Moore said, "This isn't the only thing that's going to the blind. "
People are obviously paying more for what they're getting.
The campaign has been supported by two former U.S. transport guards, who in 2011 preferred to move from Congress to a counter-mil payout in their report.
U.S. Senate approved a 90-million-dollar test project last year, involving 10,000 cars.
But working on the concerns of rural lawmakers, who were representing people who had to go to work or go to the city for a lot more miles, the leadership of the century put an end to that proposal there.
Yet many kingdoms and cities themselves are moving forward in this direction.
It contains the most desirable Oregon, which lists 5,000 drivers in the country's largest use.
These drivers will soon pay the Mileze stake instead of the government.
Nevada has already completed the initial test.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Ilineis is testing with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 group, which includes the 17 state transport departments with the previous cible, including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida, are studying how they can implement this change.
This idea was not supported everywhere.
In Nevada, where 50 free car drivers had been parked on cars a short time ago, drivers were eager to think that the government could monitor their every move.
Aluoddin Khan, who directs the political and work-implementation arrangement in the Nevada Transportation Department, says, "There was a major concern about Big Brothers and other things of the same kind."
It's not what people wanted.
As the test progressed, the A.C.L.U. of Nevada warned on its website: "To convert this device to a complete tracking device will be easy enough."
There is no need to develop a large, unmanaged industrial frame-set, which has to be spread unmanaged to keep each person's day-to-day log.
Nevada is one of many countries that is trying every chance to get the same industrialist, with the help of the government to get a description of how many miles of cars are running every day, but not where and when it is running.
Khan said that if you can do that, people can feel easier.
This scientist's research brought some government agencies to a small California Start-up called True Miles.
This farm was not in the business of helping drivers to rule in principle.
It was trying to enter the market through auto disease, where drivers had to pay based on their mail.
But the device that is currently testing was nice to the hive planner, because it does not use GPS and provides a lot of limited information, which is uploaded to the modem at the given time.
Tru Miles said, "If you don't track people's speed and position, they'll be more willing to take it."
There have been some major errors in these early Kingdom programs.
There are also very low-cost and low-cost ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are using different options.
They can choose a device for GPS devices, or without GPS.
Or no one can choose to take the device again, but the average wage determined by the citizens of the Kingdom can choose to pay on the basis of the miles.
Other places have the hope that this habit can be sold to concerned citizens instead of providing less and more facilities in the device.
In New York City, transport authorities are trying to develop a taxing device that will also allow parking meters to pay, "pay according to your drive" sickness, and create a collection of real-time data from other drivers that can be used to avoid motor traffic.
The city planning document states, "The motorists will be attracted to this because of the benefits they receive from it."
Even so, some transport planners are surprised that the entire discussion on payment according to Miles is perhaps a big distraction.
St. Francisco has said the Metropoliton Transport Agency in the area of San Francisco has said that it is easy to deal with the problem of the Devil's Hive Trust Fund by increasing the Congress's gas tax.
The hybrid or other car drivers can also be fitted with one-time or an annual payload, whose vehicles do not use much gas to pay for their proper share.
Randy Rantseller, head of state statement and public affairs, said, "When Espirin can work, what is required for him by the nuclear surgeon."
If we do that, millions of car drivers will be concerned about their privacy and many other things.

Snow Dune is prepared to "share" with Germany on the American Watch
Edward Snow Dean, U.S. Secretary of State, has announced that Berlin is ready to travel to Germany to prove the verdict if the US National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, continue to fail to answer about their activities.
German M.P. Hans Christian Strae Belle met in Russia with Mr. Snow Dan Seguruvar, where he was given a refuge to talk about the witness in Germany.
Saturday, a letter presented by Mr. Snow Dean to the media in Berlin, said: "Although my efforts have proved positive, my government believes that there is no solution to the political debate with the accused."
Although speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snow Dean said that they believe that the support of the international community can be a policy for the US government to remove their criminal charges.
The U.S. Department of Justice is involved in theft from the wire charges against the secretaries and the government's property.
Hans Peter Frederic, German Minister for Internal Affairs, told the online time: "Mr. Snow Dean, we'll find ways to make it possible."
The relationship between America and Germany is under pressure because NSA has claimed to have bugged Chancellor Angela Marcelle's phone.
Thomas Operman, the members of the World Committee, oversee the secret information. He said that if Mr. Snow Dan Cossoon as a witness would be the opportunity to "deal completely with America and not bring them into danger," it should also be taken.
Mr. Belle, a member of the Green Party of Germany, posted a photo of himself with Mr. Snow Dan on Twitter.
He said that two German journalists were on their way to Russia.
Mr. Bellene said that, according to the pre-NSA law enforcement officer, if they left Russia, they are not able to return to Snow Dun Russian.
If Snow Dan witnessed in Germany, he would be "safe" there, which would require assurances, Sansad said.
Mr. Snow Dan said in his letter, "They had to face a terrible and persistent campaign" and forced them to leave home.
Although he said that the world is happy and proud by the wide-ranging reactions "to his work of royal expression."
Together with the United States - with the world's citizens, senior authorities have estimated the mystery of a vast public service overseer.
The letter expands a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities "when the problems of the human situation have been solved."
Frontier Airlines Carey - On Baggage
Frontier Airlines has a plan to charge $100 for passengers on your flight board.
Frontier Airlines is planning to start charging for $100 for a car - on-bag, and it's going to put $2 for coffee or a discount, although Wednesday's announcement said that travelers can keep a full deb.
The new Cari - On-Silk Overhead is for bag in bin, so, the small bags below the seat will still be unplugged.
Frontier said that $25 would be charged if paid in AIDS, $100 would be expected to wait until they're on the gate.
Frontier speaker Kate O'Malley said he had to get to care for the charge in the $100 bill of travel.
"We don't want him to charge," he said.
Airlines started the charge for the first and second check baggage in 2008.
Those who are trying to escape the storm fill as much as they can in the Care - On Bag that is in the overhead debacle, meaning this debacle is often less space.
There's a way to reduce passengers on the chess board.
O'Malley said it wasn't really about paying the new charge.
It's for the most loyal customers about Frontier that the search for overheads has become more difficult than fast.
This should not be allowed to allow visitors who buy tickets on their websites.
This means that the next person in the line can pay $100 for the same bag, while a traveler in the line can get a bag free on a frontier gate.
O'Malley said that Frontier's website and check their processes are being changed to ensure that passengers know it before they get to the gate.
The new Carrie-on-Fiss of Frontier will not start until the heat has been set, even if a date has not been set.
Travelers often show dissatisfaction with luggage bags and other bags, but air services like them.
They argue that it costs money to manage the luggage, and those who want travel services should pay for it.
Bagage’s face on Wall Street is seen as a sign that many lines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
Most of them don't even have a carie-on-bag bag.
Spirit Airlines Inc. began the first three years ago with Carrie - On Shoalk, and the co-founder Allegiant Air later.
With such a shell, there is Wizz Air of other lines of Hungary, who said of the airline consultant Sorensen, and who does the Ad - On Fish Track.
He said that the Spirit's career - on-the-job brings $50 million in a year that was estimated in the December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former Middle West Airlines officer recently flew into the Spirit, and the travelers had to face an unusual bag of fish on the gate.
"The boarding process that I had seen in my airline career was easy," he said.
I was hoping to look out at the toothbrush and a battle gate.
"It was filled with candles and he said it was lickety-split."
Frontier is also tracking coffee, tea, quits, or $2 bill of Spirit for Juice.
Frontier's good that the traveler who leaves, or Juss takes, can keep the whole debs, and this free coffee will only give for once.
It will still drain the water.
In 2008, they tried to charge for drinking substances in the U.S. Airways summary, but they moved back seven months after the trip's complaint and followed any other main line there.
If the travelers of Frontier's don't buy directly from the airline, this step of Frontier's to operate its customers against their own website is its recent effort to charge the payroll on.
Airline pays the online travel vendor Orbitz for a fee of $10 to $25 for every ticket that's gone wrong.
That's why all airlines have been encouraged to operate passengers to buy them directly instead of going through an online travel agency.
Frontier though, has gone ahead in this area.
In September, a number of flights began to be paid half to customers who had been bought from an online travel agency by these people.
On Wednesday, it reduced the mile's rate to 25 percent of trip miles.
A thousand miles of Frontier Trip, purchased from an online travel agency, will then require 250 miles of distance.
It's also that they allow Frontier to select their seat in advance for single travelers directly on purchase from the website.
There's a loyal client base in your home city in Frontier's Denver, but it's getting less and it's losing money.
The decline of 9 percent in the empire and its capacity to fly has decreased by about 13 percent in the first trimester, according to the continued financial results by the Corporate Parent Republic Airways Holdings Ink.
They're trying to set Frontier's money as part of the sale of the Republican Airlines.
N.S. has charged hackers to be a website crash instead of "internal error"
Secret National Security Agency told Friday that our website had been closed for a few hours because of some technical lack, not because of the hackers, as some people have said online.
The secret agency said in an e-mail address, "Today the night was not in reach for several hours of NSA.gov, which was due to an internal error that occurred during the pre-specified update."
Tonight will solve this problem.
It's not true that this obstacle was caused by a service-distributed denial [D.D.O.S.] attack.
In the evening, the online server trackers found that the website of the N.S. was closed for at least six hours, and the site is not accessible for some users yet.
N.S.A. spokesperson told A.B.C. News that the Agency's internal, sensitive network had not been fully understood.
The speaker said that no classified information is in danger.
At least one keyboard group has claimed online that they are responsible for blocking the website of the N.S.A. through the D.D.S. attack.
The D.D.S. attack is designed so that traffic is sent to more than the target website until the site is closed because the server is overloaded.
This cyber strategy is unexpected and the goal of attacks is not to interfere with the internal network of the target system.
In the past too many secretive N.S.S., which was never called "such an agency", there has been much discussion and discussion among the general public over the last few months about the presence of foreign and domestic jazz events - which occurred after the destruction of the N.S.S. files by Edward Snowden, who was jointly dismissed by the N.S.A.
As a result of such a growing argument about Agency, such arrests were held this evening after the event, which was the result of a marked cyber operation.
In the age of two and today's contexts of harmony, a beautiful expression was presented according to the story 'One and Terrorism'.
It was shown that in today's trial, a teacher is forced to walk in the wrong way.
The concert's thanksgiving Saint Joseph Inter College's participation was joined by the Chief Extremist Governor Walmiki, the chairman of the camp ceremony, the German Consul, and the strength of the lion.
The drama showed the consistency of the violence of the Age of the Ages and the conditions of a professor's arwind.

Bombardier crashed as a plane rescuer, crashed in orders
Canada's Airship and Train Mekker Bombardier Inc informed Thursday of a 15 percent decrease in net profits, in its third trimester in the railway unit and less pressured by air command and maintenance on the connection points.
Bombardier, also based on Montreal, did not submit an update on any flight test data for his brand new CSeries flight to go to business service on September 1st.
Almost one and a half months before the first flight of the test plane, it's only been blown three times, the question is whether the test phase is on the track.
The result is lower than expected and has been sent to the Sharer Toronto Stock Exchange for more than 8 percent of the slide.
Cameron Dorsen, with the National Bank Financiel, a analyst, reduced his rating for the "area exhibition" on Thursday by one or two weeks.
"The major air carriers were expecting more, we are clearly disappointed in the transport display," Dorsen said in a client note.
We'll get a new command for Bombardier CSeries as progress of the flight test program.
Although, if no new commands are announced in the coming months, it is likely that the market program will be compromised.
Bombardier is expected to be able to cut it at least at the end of the business of Boing and Airbus.
The first test was unraveled in March and was launched for the first time in September after the delay.
The potential Croatian New Jetliner waits for the results of the flight test to accept the company's claims about fuel integrity and potential cost savings, but such as the fixed order for CSeries to 177.

The new research has shown that we work with all honesty and dedication in the morning.
They don't lie to anyone, and they don't believe to steal or deceive.
But in the evening, our minds change and we start acting against the rules on the one hand.
Researchers at Harvard University and the University of Utto have given a number of interesting facts in this research of the School of Business.
According to the research, we prefer moral values without the stress of working in the morning, but in the evening we get tired or more pressure.
The research used two for it.
He told some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For example, people were to tell that the point is more to the left or the right.
Those who participated were told that if they answered correctly, they would be given money.
The experiment showed that the people used between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make any mistakes and answered correctly.
There it was when people were used between noon and noon at 6:00 p.m. to keep their principles in mind and respond in the wrong way.
The research has proven that the desire for money in the morning does not make a difference to our honesty, but in the evening we stop providing morals.
This research is published in the latest issue of Cyological Science.

Mr. Bigg, the chief attorney of Cocos, who has classified the police investigation.
42 - year - old ditta was reporting to the criminal Neal Scarboro in the kitchen
The president thought that his secretive medicine might be known to people
Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison
The chief attorney of the rescue party, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, because he was afraid of his secret medical condition, will be known to the public for three years.
The 42-year-old Brassat Ditta provided sensitive confidential information about his Nil Scarboro's recent medical examination of the operations.
This deputy, who was named "Bish", and whose crimes were praised as "Top Brief", was arrested in 2011 after the police surveillance operation in Scarboro, which he represented in the last Narcotics Trail.
The authorities saw Scarboro 32-year-old in Blackburn, Lancashire, holding three bags of cocaine in the lawyer's house, while he went out with his colleagues for the LA company diner.
After obtaining the corn of cocaine in his teeth, his boots, and his credit cards, he found out that ditta was a "regular user" of class A drugs.
During the eight months between August 2011 and January, he tried to obtain unlawful information about the arrest of two people by Scarboro and his associate.
Lukashier, Cumbria, Mercesside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire were then being monitored by the police as part of the main investigation of the Heroin and Cooking Group.
There were 32 other people who were sent to prison after a total of 1.5 million pounds of fines, including heroin and cocaine, and more than 200,000 pounds of fines.
The 42-year-old did inform the criminals, because he feared that people would not know about his chocone's fate.
The state law firm for Forbes soloists in Blackbank was currently facing a failure in the Liverpool Crown Court after three weeks of trial in two cases after the trial of the trial.
He agreed to keep the cocaine in his previous hearing.
The bad time of the lawyer began when the police found out when Scarboro was in regular contact with Dita since February 2011.
Two joss followed the accident and saw it coming into the house of the dentist, and in Black Golf Gloves, the lawyer was down to 60 percent of the cure that was clean.
After being treated, he was in regular contact with Scarboro Detta on the phone, which had been released for the Diner in the BlackRovers Football Stadium, Evod Park.
When the lawyer arrived home, he found out that there was a drug and that there was nine conversations between them.
The court heard that he was found by the "regular user" of cocaine in an examination of a class A class-based drug on teeth, buttocks and credit cards.
Detta was arrested later, but he refused to use the Cocos and said that he was talking to the affected dealer, because he was his client and said that their discussion was about "medical privileges".
During his arrest, Dita pulled out her wallet and tried to remove many credit cards, but they had been captured, and her hair had been sampled.
In police testimony, he said he was running office with his place of work and Saat from his home, and his client called on his home for medical matters.
After describing what Joshua knew about them by the chief men who were arrested, it was reported in the court hearing that the dentist had called on people of the victim's group, some of whom he had previously presented.
On the side of the accession, Annie White said: "The criminal must be best known not to break the law."
As an offender on Mr. Detta, there is a charge of using his position to connect much more with his specific client.
We're not talking about the general drug dealer, we're not talking about the dealer who's providing his lawyer with the drug.
They shall surely be quiet, because he is a judge.
But he's out of his range of legal clients.
As much as possible, he forced the police to remain able to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Datt was not the honor of his work, but of shame.
He made more close to some certain clients, especially Scarboro, and allowed his freedom to be interpreted.
Detta denied any wrongs and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer who wasn't me, and if I wanted to inform Mr. Scarboro, I wouldn't wait for 15 hours, but I did it right away.
But after hearing the Lukashier Police Superintendent Lee Hallstead said: "When Mr. Dita began to seek cure from organized criminals, they turned themselves into a criminal criminal."
Because of their cocoon's laxness, they got too upset and became much weaker for the purposes of members of the organized criminal groups, who used it to obtain important information related to the police investigation.
Residents must maintain the highest standard of faithfulness, and have faith and self-confidence in people.
Mr. Dita has been fooled by this belief and has tried to save her career.
The Lukashier's serious and organized crime unit tested Mr. Dita, in which it was found guilty of holding them in Cocos and now of three cases of imprisoning the path of justice, which demonstrates our resistance to bring the criminals to justice.
This matter should be a warning to the criminals that no one is far from the law.
We will seek you out and present you before the court.
Skarboro was sentenced to 14 years after being convicted of offering heroin, cocaine and bilge.
Fifty other members included in the group were sent to Karavas for a total of 153 years for Nazi drug crimes.
Detta gave her questions and answers on her website, in which she said that her fancy job would be to become a lawyer for a death penalty client in America, to be their diner guest, and to be motivated by incompatibility for their work.
Kenya’s press on the disputed media law is acquiesced
The press letter challenged the lawyer as an immoral, saying, "This is a terrible place, and it's valid to ask, "What is to prevent the lawyer's freedom from being removed by trial tomorrow?"
Capitol Group - Kenya's most respected free radio station and news website CapitolFM company, director Cyrus Kamau said, "This is law cruel and very reprehensible, and we reject it."
He said the new media court "will remain respectful because it is a part of the government" and said that banning content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
They said, "I hope the president will listen to us, and we urge them to reject this Prophet and send him back to the people."
According to The Star newspaper, the new legislature will provide "hard control over the media", while The Standard said that the freedom of the public and speech in Kenya has been "scattered" and cruelly told the lawyer.
This prosecutor, in September, is being passed as a means of strengthening national security after the attack by the Islamic Armed Forces in Westgate Shopping Mall.

They said, "When the kings are abandoned, they will certainly bring us back to the world, in which there is no protector and no one to gather."

In May, they refused to reject the sections ordered by the National Oil Foundation, and about 532,000 Shilling images, restoring the free treadmill, which is considered to be the world's highest.

The U.N. has set a new target for dealing with poverty
The United Nations is about to begin work on a new target group, which will replace the development goals that were launched 12 years ago to deal with global poverty.
To replace M.D.D. in 2015, the Australian politician played a very important role in advancing the "Societal Development Goals" that began in Rio de Janeiro all night long before the upcoming development summit.
They were included in the final format of the document, which will be supported by the world leaders during the summit with the Sussir Galard.

Mozambique’s security concerns are fueled by individuals as a snare
With a statue of President Semora of Mozambique, who was rolling down on them, thousands gathered in Central Maputo for peace in a sad public display.

The conflict between government forces and Ree Nomo has been reported almost daily for two weeks, more than 20 years after a peace agreement.
Re Nomo was once a part of the efforts to disrupt the country’s free government as a part of its efforts to break free from the white rule of Rhodesia and the colourful movement supported by the government of South Africa.
After the 1992 peace treaty, it became a refugee party.
Analysts believe it is not possible to return to the country's full-developed conflict, but recent events have encouraged foreign immigrants and local people.
The dams are rising for the fastest-growing economy in the West. The Rio Tinto, Brazil's Well, can bring some of the companies with Eni from more than $50bn in the next year.
Since 1975, hundreds of Frelimo parties have blamed each other for the main political power, and for the pressure of Ree Nomo.
Rey Nomo says that the government launched the latest attack on its members on 17 October in Sofia, a translation of a Ree Nomo fortress.
The former rebels were attacked and the government forces again attacked Renomo's premises, and reported to Fonso Dhaka Ma, group leader, Fernando Manong, Financial Times, attempting to kill Renomo's leader.
The government blames Ree Nomo for the Triger on charges of assaulting soldiers.
President Armando Gibuzan has expressed his appreciation for the concerns about instability.
Mr. Gbuzzen told the French news agency that Mr. Dhakama had seen himself as a "serious" "whoever the armies are trying to prove that they can apply their own decision to the government."
Free Limo and Ree Nomo insist that they want to escape the war.
Mr. Mang was quoted as saying that Ree Nomo had abolished the peace treaty in 1992 but later became a matter of concern.
They're telling FT what the deal isn't being respected by free limo.
We have to come back for the argument talk, but seriously," said Mr. Mangane.
The last conversation between the two sides did nothing special to reduce a series of tensions of this year's conflict.
"This is about two great men fighting together," said Joseph Han of London Open University, a explanation and Mozambiqueian expert.
Some of them aren't good talkers, and some of them don't have to be ready to create the kind of puzzles.
Re Nomo, insisting on the election for improvements, said about the eviction of the city's corporate elections already in November.
President and presidential elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have explained their use of force as a patient movement effort to win the government’s profits and financial losses.
Ree Nomo's participation in the municipality has been declining since 1992, while a new party, a former Ree Nomo member, is expected to improve the democratic movement of Mozambique (MDM) in elections.
Mr. Mong says Mr. Gibuzenko -- who left office next year at the end of his second term -- wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want a majority democracy, he doesn't want to leave the presidency because he doesn't want peace, he doesn't want a transparent choice," said Mr. Mong.
The capacity of Ree Nomo has not been clarified, but it's a major thing that they've done around the police stations and vehicles on the southern highway.
Most of the caves are located in the province of Mehai, north of Jomaputo, hundreds of kilometres away, including the host Beera port, which trusts the export of corals with Rio Tinto and the valley.
After threatening to attack Ree Nomo line, the railway slowed its use for about a week in June.
Re Nomo would find this danger duplicated or not was Mr. Mangrove when asked about it.
Re Nomo was not going well in Mozambique who wanted to warn the international community, Mr. Mong said.
The government of instability has increased the strains, Fernando Lima, Media Cop, says, who is the leader of a free media company, many people are also concerned about the trend of corruption, slow development, and arrests.
"People have government and presidents responsible for the country's future, and it seems to be one to find solutions to problems," they say.
The Omar government, a viewer, still needs stability.
"No one cares about Ree Nomo and free limo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the streets," he said.

Ben Greenman: 10th anniversary of the New York Comic Day: The New Yorker
People can argue that the New York City is the home of the Standard Commodia in America: almost a hundred years ago, Hashi filmmaker Frank Fe, who worked as a festival teacher in the Pales Theatre, began to hear the crowd’s conversation in a straight tone.
Fae's search has been extended over the years, most recently in the New York Comedy Fostival.
This year's 10th anniversary, which included more than six shows in small clubs and big theaters, was celebrated and celebrated by Caroline Harsh, the founder of the Standard Up Organisation called Carolines.
Harsh says, "Most of them were seen in headliners in Carolines, and they became very successful, to the extent that they became very large to be played at the club."
We created this celebration as a way to continue working with them.
This year's program includes the presence of Vanda Síx, Katie Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the annual music and comedy benefits for military service in Madison Square Garden, "Stand Up for Heroes", which included other artists including Bruce Springstein, John Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.
The world of comedy has expanded along with the expansion of celebration.
Many who participate in this year's celebration have come from non-traditional comedy media, such as comedy Central, F.X., and Spick, coming to a small network.
Nick Kroll, a DP-Qable Sitcom (F.X.C., unlike Ronchi Fantasy-Football Theme, "The League"), came to the top, and now their own comedy central chess show.
Jenny Slate is a member of "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recovery", although they are best known for their Various Video Series "Marsel The Shell Wid Shuez On."
Other young comedians, including Crowl and Slate, who have different voices, are the products of American comedy.
Among the main attractions of the celebration will be a Witness: Talking to Larry David of David Stinburg:
Stinburg has started to work as a Standup comedian, but they have become nomi TV and film director, as well as illegal comedy historians.
From 2005 to 2007, they hosted the show "Site Down Comedy David Stinburg" on the TV Land.
This meeting will be in the centre of Manhattan, Town Hall.
Stinburg said, "The city is definitely in the comedy of all the activities of Larry."
They were telling me that when they were here, they would sometimes go between the two buildings and think that if I ever lost all my money, I'd stay here.
Oil is falling to $96 per barrel.
A report on the cost of oil continued to fall on Friday as a matter of concern, where the hunger building area of power in China is being strengthened.
For December, Benchmark America's cheap New York Mercantile Exchange was 14 cents down in electronic trading in Europe late in the morning to $96.24 per barrel.
5.8 percent down for the month of October, Thursday fell 39 cents.
The price of cheap oil is enough in recent weeks.
The energy department told Wednesday that US supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week

The Court has obstructed the activity of the New York Police Department on the break and play policy
Thursday, a United Court of Appeal ordered a judge to suspend the New York Police Department and remove the judge from the case.
The U.S. Circuit Court Court 2 And Judge Shira Shindler said that the results of a court decision would be delayed by an appeal by the city.
In the city of the judge, they had informed the people of the violation of the Constitution in August of their banning and questioning program.
The city's police department has also decided to assign a supervisor to help with its policy and related training program changes, its conclusion and its therapeutic order.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments on Tuesday’s journey.
The Court of Appeal has said that since he has to explain the need for a judge to avoid partiality in part of a series of media testimonies and that he must be removed from the case of the judge from the behavioural literature of the US judges by public authorities, the public must be held accountable in order to address the court's arguments.
The judge announced the decision, although the police officers wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people with their pauses and play shows, focusing on black and Spanish men.
He has set up an external monitor to monitor major changes in nurturing, training and surveillance with financial improvements, and he is most shut down where in some areas a pilot program has been ordered to test the body's clothing cameras.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were suspended by a police officer.
A verbal argument on the city's appeal is indicated for some time after March 14, 2014.
A break and play device has been discussed with citizens' rights.
The break and the cricket policy has somehow been around for decades, but most black and Spanish men, 684330 to 2011, have been targeted by Free Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration as a dramatic obstacle to growth.
A trial of four men was conducted by all small figures in 2004 and a class action became a case.
The support for change in NYPD's pause and play program has said that an even more reliable and effective police force will end the misconduct and may influence the use of police in other police departments.
Opponents say the changes will reduce the force of the police, but crime, money, and not last decade will solve a major problem of police force by thousands of officials after the earthquake.
The judge has noted that there was no end to the pause and the playwright, which is legitimizing, but had improved the implementation of the NYPD's stop.
Many of the participants included in the training were Goddess, Papus, Zemsedpur, wealth, thousands, and four-year-olds.
During the seven-day period, all participants were informed of a number of studies, including ten peaching, flag pole.
Dr. Azothosh Kumar Rei and Jesus, in cooperation with the profession of education.
All the participants are sharing the feelings of unity, joining in prayer.
The Chief of Staff is providing their special cooperation with the training provided by the Queen of State.

The court said that the newspaper appointed private investigator Glen Mulkeir to hack the Polish Voysemel and "keep an eye", but Colsen also called and left his Voysemel.
Mr. Addis Ababa said, "The suggestion of the accession party is that Mr. Colson, who is currently the editor of the N.O.T.Blu, is not known to be standing outside the people's home to watch them, but they have articles in front of people, to see how people react to him."

During this time, the former chief reporter Nevillei Steurlback and former reporter James Verderup saw the monitoring of the arrival of Sushi Polby.
On June 18, 2005, Collins told them through a Voyssmal: "I've got a story that we're planning to run tomorrow, which I'd definitely want to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Addis said that colson's involvement in this case is in the other important parties, such as the former house-holding David Blancett.
The court informed Thursday that Colson had talked to Mi. Blancett about the relationship with a married woman, while he was seeing the case of co-terrorist Rebecca Brooks who were married at the time.
Colson and Brooks refused to associate with others to telephone between October 3 200 and August 9, 2006.

According to the U.S. National Security Agency, the oil company Petrobras of Brazil was jostling, and our clown suppliers, Google and Yahu, and Yahu, were afraid of the government’s official oversight.
The last thing was when I found out that Chancellor Angela Marcelle's phone was broken, probably a decade ago.
If Europe's most powerful people can be noted, trade world leaders are definitely also making possible targets.
Snodon has made major cooperation between the US Secret Services and companies transparent.
I think it would be useful to use these data for mutual benefit.
"German must wake up," says Oliver Green, president of BITMI, who represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published in July by the German companies, the United States has now become a major target, such as China, when it comes to industrial fraud and data theft.
In all the documents led by Mr. Snowden, there is, however, no evidence to date that America went to the trade secrets of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern about the lack of Internet capabilities of the European Union, and it should try to reduce its dependence on America.
Business world leaders are doubting it.
Someone in the German parliament said we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
Haso Plattner, president of the German Business Software Company SAP, said, "This is no way,"
If any strong European IT industry wanted it, it would not have been allowed to die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany comes from coal, from cars, to boilers.
But the IT industry is everything.
The United States' technological clearance and Yasusi access has proven to be an attack on some companies that were exposed to the greatest surveillance threat of their first belief in China.
A major change is taking place in the cloud computing area where the European authorities are more vigilant that data stored in the United States is subject to that authority and are therefore likely to become sensitive.
According to a survey carried out by a business organization, some 10 non-American members cancelled their plan to use a US-based broadcast after opening a Data Prime Crime Program.
Jim Snabe, the chief executive officer of SAP, says: "We saw a new question that did not come to customers a year ago -- that is - my data is stored? And can you guarantee that it will be physically in that area?"
Many German authorities argue that the latest reports are just confirming whether they already knew: the powerful government wants to steal their most secure secrets and data and should therefore be on guard at all costs.
It's not a wonder that economics is a jesus.
It's always happened.
"This has been a subject for many years, and through the original current discussion, nothing has changed," says Kurt Bock, the chief executive of the chemical manufacturer BASF.
The United States is looking for us at the commercial and industrial level, and we are doing it, because it is in national favour for the preservation of our business.
Corporate leaders are generally reluctant to protect the system and this is a benefit for the attack.
For large companies, the message has been being recorded for a long time, although it is not clear whether to leave a business in the house by taking usb stick, or to leave a laptop bepanah in a hotel's room to say less.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of the car manufacturer's audio, says that this is an old system before the board's meetings to collect mobile phones as their use could not be as remote audio devices
Germany's BfV staff advises to consider using a simple pre-ped mobile when smart phone is being disrupted over a period of time.
Prepaid mobile phone was dropped later.
Although, small and medium-sized companies are at risk of hacking and monitoring it is a matter of concern.
In Germany, this company is popular in the global market in a special place.
"Small and medium-sized companies often have a lack of experience, workers and financial resources to effectively protect the integrity of the corporate," BfV warns in a report.
The United States has warned of its own financial jesus from other countries.
According to France The Washington Post, the name of the U.S. National Chufiya in February with Russia and Israel, which is named after China's financial disclosure, is in another tiger of related crimes in hacking.

The parents of Georgia's child killed in a "wonderful accident" believe that their son was killed
A young man in Georgia whose dead body was found trapped in his high school gym in the restaurant mat, believed that their son had been killed, the family leader said to Thursday.
Waldosta, K.G., Kendrick Johnson, was arrested in a standing mat behind their high school gym on January 11th.
London County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson was dead in a 'unique accident', but the 17-year-old boy's family refused to do so.
Benjamin Rape, who presented Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News Dot Com: "They must fully believe that their son has been killed."
They don't trust death in the way they were told to Sheriff.
Rape said, "They must believe that this is a matter of physical law and common sense."
They believe that this conclusion is a defence for the death of their son or the protection of the people.
They said, "They sent their son to school with a book-back, and he returned to a body bag."
U.S. Prime Minister Michael Muller told Thursday that he was conducting an informal investigation into Johnson's death, as many important questions were answered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his murder caused by a crime?
More said these words to Thursday at a newspaper conference in the afternoon.
I'll follow the facts, they'll take us anywhere.
My purpose is to bring the truth to the fore.
He said, "I think there's an environmental reason for an occupational test."
Mure told the reporter that the initial show study showed that Johnson's death resulted from "static consciousness".
According to the wall, a second bullet was found in a different cause of death."
They said: "There are many questions that must be answered or that should be confirmed."
Mure also said that if he finds sufficient witnesses to seek or investigate civil rights in Johnson's death case, he will ask the FBI to do so.
Delegates were not available immediately for comments from the London County Sheriff office when contacting Thursday.
On Wednesday, the South Georgia judge ordered the authorities, the investigators, to release all surveillance videos.
The boy's parents say they're hoping they'll get some sign of his death.
C.C. issued children's URI reference instructions for schools
On Wednesday, the disease control and prevention center issued guidelines to control the eating of children's allergy at the school.
The U.S. government has issued such guidance for the first time, as the number of children in school is increasing.
Now one child in 20 in the U.S. has food allergy.
C.D.C. found that between 1997 and 2007, children had increased 18 percent in food allergy cases.
This guidance provides information for students on how teachers and workers should be informed about the eating of children's allergy, and how to handle it in the event of an allergic reaction.
Students have also been suggested to keep the stocks of epinephrine to cope with potentially deadly tuberculosis (anaphylaxis), which is the auto-injector of the Eppen Brand that is most commonly used.
The state parliament has recently updated the rules, which enables students to keep the stocks of Epinephrine more easily.
This report also contains a list of common symptoms that are transmitted by children with an electrical response.
The kids can say, "Something seems to be in my tongue," "I think it's in my tongue," or "I think it's in my tongue."
Parents of intersex kids can choose their children's 'ling undefined'
Germany has become the first European Union country to approve the third sex for children born with indiscriminate genital mutilation.
Young children will no longer be repeatedly specified by men or women.
Under the new law, parents do not need to announce sex for such children, this law allows them to declare sex "unspecified" or "unspecified" on the child's birth certificate.
The aim of the new law is to reduce the pressure on parents who can make decisions about sex-specificity for newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex children.
According to the B.B.C., an interactive person said years later, "I'm neither a man nor a woman."
I'm going to be a pain in the ass, made by doctors.
According to estimates, there is a male among the two thousand every year who has neither child nor daughter.
They're intersex, part of a group of nearly 60 situations, which comes within the study of sexual development disorders, this is a common word that is used for unusual qualities, genetics (individuals or growth), or unusually developed sex.
Maybe Valis Simpson is still intersex.
Gender identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States believe that when sex cannot be arranged, it is best to use the best information available to specify sex and to treat it, to monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before such a change occurs.
Psychological Dr. Jack Drassesser of New York City, who is experts on gender issues, said that Germany's new law "seems good."
Intersex children create moral inequality.
They said, "Some people are in a state of mental illness, but most of them do not have children."
You can only specify a line without a line-check, and then see how identification is developed.
The science of how any sex develops in a child is not very accurate.
No one can give a proper answer as to why this is happening.
It's a kind of puzzle why people are homosexual.
In the 2011 report submitted to the European Commission, Intersexuals are described differently as transsexuals or transgenders, because their situation is not related to sex, but is related to their life-form, which is neither clearly male nor female, nor is it a composite form, nor is either clearly defined.
These features can show themselves a secondary sexual attraction, such as the weight of the muscles, the distribution of the hair, the breast and the length; primary sexual attraction such as reproductive limbs and genital mutilation; or qualitative design and hormones.
The report provides an overview of the differences faced by Inter-Sex and Transgender people in the field of workers, as well as of harassment, violence and respect for crimes.
Now there are special camps for non-sex boys.
Australia and Nepal have already been allowed to mark older persons on their official documents as men, women or "third sex".
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie Me-Walby became the first certified "Lingine" in the world after winning the "unspecified" sex class.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, there will also be a third specification for persons other than M or F in German passports as X.
According to the news report on France 24, the neighboring country still has issues related to sex in France.
In 2011, French legislators from this strictly Catholic country signed on orchia to return to the "ling principle" books of the school.
The website of the U.S. Catholic Online also opposes this German law, "while the world is going in a state where the sexes themselves are chosen, but not the youth activism, we are taking two and more columns in the opposite direction."
In Maryland, the mother of a newborn baby told Babe Jon that she would like to see her children be identified as a baby at the time of birth.
He said on the website about the upbringing, "The upbringing is very stressful without limits, especially if you don't even know what your child's sex is."
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both males and females were called Hermaphrodites (Ubaillingi), which was named after the beautiful Greek goddess, Dvilingi.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered the band to be a slat that could be deleted and then written.
But now many people are challenging the morale of Shishak, they understand that sex-learning is complex, and sometimes even with doctors who don't know how they will feel about their sex specification when they grow up.
Dresser says, "In the middle of the 20th century, it was called "Monorog disaster".
When these children were born, you didn't call the psychotics, you called the Shili-Chitics.
The current principle on the treatment of indiscriminate genital mutilation was presented by Dr. John Mani of John Happkins University, who considered the sex to be acceptable.
They gave the word "Ling ID" and reasoned on how social and environmental signs - parents raise the child - interacting with the child's genes and hormones to identify him as a man or a woman.
But in a 1966 case, which is known as "John/Joan", the principles became debated.
They advised a child who had had had an accident during the sex-laundering (seremssion) and mother-to-parent to complete the child's sentence and to be like a red-skinned girl.
Dresser said, "Manny presented the matter as a success case, but it didn't happen."
At 15 years of age, the child changed himself as a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Dresser said some doctors are still "watching the same image".
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, the people who were passing through the band of Shili-Chickeetas began to face "not happy with the ideals".
This was the case with 36-year-old author Jim Bruce, who was born with X.Wai. Man with qualities, but his genetics were unclear.
The doctors didn't clearly understand that his sex was small, or that he was older, but they were sure that he could never live as a "satisfying life."
Thus, shortly after his birth in 1976, his exodus was excommunicated and his teenage daughter was excommunicated outside of Bruce.
She was given a female hormone at the age of 12.
He said to ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl."
I wasn't happy, but it was very difficult to question.
At 18 years of age, she was going to be Vezinoplasti.
But feeling uneasy and some confusion, he asked for medical records.
This made him aware of the terrible truth.
I was bound when I was born - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with D.S.D., who prevented his body from producing enough testosterone, which did not properly develop his gene.
After learning the truth, he became a man, he took a testosterone meal and removed his ashes.
She's gone because she's crazy.
Today, he explains people about interactive people in the Interface Project organization to make their views normal.
However, the California-based media group Advockets for Infomed Switzerland's associate director, Ani Tamer-Matis, expresses concern that the German law "invites chipi and kaluk."
They say, "Many activists think that German law will prompt a swift decision on the parent and the child to specify "unspecified."
We are afraid that this will encourage action.
We think it's better to specify a male or a female gender than to wait.
But we don't know how the law works, so we can just assume.
Tammer-Matis said that their organization supports Australian law because "it allows the elderly to be identified in the third line."
He said, "The elderly should be able to make their own decisions about the media."
The law of Germany refers to the date of its birth.
It's not a war fought by new children at this time.
When grown up, they can make their own body-related decisions.
But the breast of Pittsburgh Radiologist Dr. Erlin Baratz, whose daughter has a juvenile development disorder, and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said the German law would "give both parents and children power."
Baratgi's daughter was born with qualities of Katy man, but she had a complete androgen-insensitivity index called the D.S.D.
Since his androids were guilty in the country, women's favorites developed in Katy.
His body is Jonah, but there is no pregnancy or depression.
Now 29-year-old Katy is married and resident at the University of Pennsylvania at the Bal Mental Sciences Department.
Although she's a band, she expects to be a mother through a gourmet or a hospitable nurse.
Baratz said, "This is a law which enables parents to make their own decisions without delay."
It provides them with proper understanding and time by some tests before writing 'man' or 'woman'.
So, you're okay - raise the child, love the child.
You have a love child and enjoy it.
We don't need to do any kind of surgery soon, which can't be returned.
They said, “This decision brings forth children, and sets free from worry the parents, because they do not believe that they are doing right.”
Finally, the child will determine which bond he is easier with -- and it will be a very good thing.
It enables children to make their own decisions.
The Cheerman and the All-Ramangar Committee of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Justice of the University of Qour, chaired the Central School of Ramangar, organized a legal wake-up camp.
In which students and others were informed of the law for the right of education and economically for those behind it.
Advocket Emil Kupta, Rohin India, and Sarpach, in the camp, woke up the people talking about the subject.
A large number of indigenous people were present in the program.
Report: Consider the biden dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Client.
According to New York Times, the close advisors of President Barack Obama secretly considered Hillary’s client for the 2012 ticket to the office of vice president Kelley Beden.
The most remarkable threat in the mystery is that Mark Halperin and John Helman, expected by 2012 campaign Tom, "Double Down: Change the game 2012."
Times received a copy of the next book, and Thursday night told the president's top advisors what would help Obama to find out in the fall of the election hope that he would be able to help dump bidins to organize "wide-ranging group-sessions and late 2011".
According to National Political Dialoguer Jonathan Martin, the book explains the full impact of the change from the vice president of the former state to the White House to the White House, so that he can know what changes are made to the pole by the vice president of the former State.
A possible switch was a very secure secret between the basic layers of Chicago’s campaign and the Oval Office.
Only half of the president's closest consultants – including the president – were aware of changes in East Obama's campaign, Chief Jim Massina, and East White House's senior consultants, David Axlerod and David Paluffe.
"Double Down" claims that the deposit attempted to change Bedin despite their personal agreement, when their information was finally being made, there will be no improvement in Obama's situation from the client's ticket.
In a witness with Martin, Pute has confirmed that the administration had actually considered the location of Clinton with Bedin.
"He told me to keep an eye on the whole vision, and one of them put it on," he said to the newspaper.
You remember that the president was in danger at that time, and we were on a stage like this, "Holy Christ, what more shall we do?"
While Pute told the research as "precautionary", Martin told CNN's Andersen Cooper again the election campaign took an important step in finding how much this claim would pay for being Paul.
"They don't spend money like the campaign money on focus groups until they're serious about something," Martin told C.C.360.
It's unclear, recent, whether Obama knew their team was looking for a change.
Martin told CNN that he asked if their boss knew about the possible change?
While he said that "they didn't think the president knew about the possible change," former Chief of Staff admitted it is "probably" that Obama knew.
"Dubble Down" is certain: wouldn't answer if the political test came to Obama's desk? Martin told me more.
Cooper asked Martin if he didn't know about Obama Biden's serious dumping ticket investigation.
"Probably," said Martin.
Do you like Glo-in-Dark Ice Cream?
A British engineer made the world's first use of Glo-in-D-D-Dark Ice Cream-Zelifish.
Charlie Francis has taken full advantage of the marine animals to develop a better destruction.
He came up with this idea after reading a search letter on Zelyfish, and China’s convinced scientists made use of chemical light to relight the protein.
This cream, which the eaters will respond to with the language, will increase the PH level of the protein and the ice cream will shine.
Chris says icecream is excited with a warm reaction to the mouth, which means it's going to be so excited to win.
Lic M.M. Delisius Izcream's founder, Charlie, said: "This is incredible, but the production of the early days will be about £200."
The protein we're using in icecream will react with a neutral pash in the language.
As soon as the face is warm, the protein pash will increase and the ice cream will shine.
We've been testing it for the past few months and it seems right to share it with Halloween because it's a wonderful light.
It's probably the most important ice cream that's made by me because it's worth four times as much as the light gold of Zelfish.
The cost of each cup comes to me about 140 pounds.
Although the taste is very good.
Charlie's commercial company, based in Bristol, is famous for apne unusual flavor, including beer, pine, meat and gold card.
But its next design will prove to be more important.
They said, "I really wanted to develop an invisible crime."
It's a natural impossibility because of ice crystals that make ice cream infractions, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
This cream is used as a duplicate of a gelifish, which has been studied by Chinese scientists
The Queen's Garden Market had lost the whole market of customers.
Recently, people had to wait 15 to 20 minutes to buy cargo.
This is the recent Vagirpur, Antika Wojni, Nanarpur, Ashok Muhar Central Market, and the Pacific Muhart in Central Market.
Some of these were also found at the Serrafa shops in Model Town, Pitompura, Ashok Bay.
These also bought for the people, and bought with them jewels of gold and silver.
That's why I was stuck in other markets with the outside ring road.
Although it took hours to get home from the office.

When I was a kid, Halloween was magic.

We will not use anything according to the Confectionery Association during Halloween, but it will also cost about 35 million pounds.

They're the best name, "The terror behind the wall (which, in fact, is a prison), "Chech-o-choch" and were like "House of Shock."

In the end, talk to the doctor.
Charlie Brown presented the great cadre when we were kids and a Jack-O-Latten map is like a Christmas tree -- that's what we've done since we were little.
From the beginning of the last year, it was for us, "Baby these apkin's trade," because of the Pinterrest, which is why most of us have to imitate these guards and not be involved with them.

Their master Scott Elderson, 25, and their girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, Denhom, were in the fleppiet desert in the western Yorkshire, and they thanked the West Yorkshire fires for this rescue service.
After a small accident, they had been looking like crazys for their lost dog, and had been posted on social networking sites.

George Kerven: Euro Deinterlacing chose Scotts
Another Day, Another Story of Fear of Freedom
This time we have been warned that free Scotland will be required to join the whole of Europe as an EU membership.
The passport controls on Bervik and the walls of Hadrian indicate stories about the boundary of the Contilian Star.
True, the StrathClide Paper described the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, although it was not described in - expected - headslines.
No one described that the E.U. members spend most of their time changing their administrative rules according to their needs.
Since Scotland is no longer a residential area, so Brussels will be free for permanent non-compliance with Brazil in exchange for what it really wants from Scotland.
So, then, A-Kahani.
And the thing that has been stuck for so long has come together. First of all, I heard "the meaning of freedom is the passport control" of the Lebanese newspaper about 40 years ago.
Yet he lost the turning point to hear the story of the old man.
Why should we expect freedom from Scotland to be built up by Europe?
Why should the London Joke be sold for Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: Europe's biggest, war-after-war plan has finally stopped.
With the Euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
The dedicated groups are being strengthened to oppose or close the U.S. in the full e.U.
Even in Germany, the Euroscaptile Alternetive Form German Party -- which has been set up this year -- suddenly received about five million votes in the September election, and thus effectively expelled the Free Democrats (the equivalent of our free demos) from the Bundestag.
The EU's plans to build Europe are always in conflict.
However, the current economic crisis has proved to be an effective variable.
With the harsh rules imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, many people are thinking that the European project has gone far away due to the obstacles imposed on national economies.
There was not much role in the excessive budget loss of national governments in the Euro disaster - that was true only in the Greek case.
In fact, the Euro system has established the exchange rate for its members in favour of German exporters - things that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of a home currency valuation, South Europe finds itself in a situation of internal damage to production compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce the amount of income and public expenditure - encouraged by Berlin.
There is a deep European production problem ahead of current budgets and money problems.
In order to free French and German energy companies, as a result of the "red" energy losses imposed by Brazil, European industry pays four times for electricity and gas compared to the United Nations.
It's a loss of interest that we've already seen in Grangemouth.
Even if all proteins are frozen in the world, the European Petrochemicals industry cannot avoid being influenced by the U.S. Shell Gas.
As a result, there is a growing sense of rebellion among the people, especially in France, who was once the head of the E.U.
After the war, the top politicians of France saw the E.U. control Germany, and Paris as a means of providing a world-wide equivalent billing.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political legitimacy, and it has applied its own financial policies to Europe, which is why the French economy is duffling.
Result: Marie Lee Pen's Southern Party, U.S. opposition National Front has won a third-place ruling socialist in the recent subordination.
At the time, France has the most popular group with 24 percent vote -- this is a timely warning to the British lab that they cannot believe that the division to the left, will benefit themselves for the right.
What is Le Pen French cows doing with their new reputation among the working class?
The group wants to use the e. g. elections next year in the European Parliament to create a counter-attack.
If, as far as possible, the opposite groups in these options can display well, this kind of gang may first affect the European Parliament.
My view is that soon, in Europe, the E.U. will end the guise of opposition and the most precious currency.
Euro will not be completely over, but it will come back in a way that will support General Di Goll, like the "Europe of Nations (the Lord's)".
Germany and some of its implications can maintain the euro, but France and South Europe will re-start their currencies.
I expect the U.S. to keep itself away from this project, hoping to increase its proximity to the U.S.
However, the growing interest in the Pacific is indicating that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland most later?
We can choose to continue to build the Little England area (usually).
Or we can protect our own financial interests -- including telling Berlin and Brussels to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better in the long European law, provided we keep our own money.
It will be easy to work together with other countries of the same mind in Europe of non-governmental nations.
Otherwise, we should consider keeping our financial freedom on the path to Norway.
In Scotland, the S.N.P. government - remarkablely - is the most successful anti-method political campaign in Europe, which won an amazing majority in 2011 based on the Tori-Lib Dam Association, which was proposed by Leber's Chancellor Elisteir Darling.
It would be absurd to vote for freedom for Scotland at this time, because in that situation it would be subject to the rules of the constitution imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
A YOUNG PEOPLE ASK... THE BIBLE’S VIEWPOINT
Research shows that African-American and Spanish girls are getting younger than their teenage girls.
Physical change does not mean that youth is close
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemical can be blamed.
Experts believe that stalwart anger can be a cause of youth in a low age
Young people in pre - Christian times may not be so effective
The former communicator Pat Etherijs of C.N. are experts in the health and family issues of children.
Should the mother be concerned if the development of the breast and the birth of the baby begin in her daughter at age 7 or 8?
This week, in Orlando, Florida, U.S. Children's Medicine Academy annual conference, Bal Doctor Andocrynologist Dr. Paul Caplovitz explained that these initial physical changes are common in American girls, they show new behavior.
Caplovitz says, "I spend a lot of time trusting the stakeholders - that it usually doesn't show rapid progress in the direction of full youth."
The apparent signs of development, such as the enthronement of the stems, the hair of the cervix, and the body's mucous membranes, appear before time.
But in the last four decades, there has been a significant change in the age of Revelation (first month).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in 1970.
"When the breast begins to develop, the first generation seems to be at least two or three years old," says Caplovitz, who says, "time-to-time youth in girls: guidance is needed to deal with this common problem."
The most accurate test of youth development is time.
Young people argue about what is beginning, but when they grow up with breast development before 8 years of age, they call it "baby-growth".
In most cases this process will be slowed down or stopped - which children can monitor closely.
In the case of more rapid progress, an endocrynologist may need to be checked to remove the possibility of serious problems such as tumors or system.
Treatments for delaying pre-munist religions and other outcomes are: early age-advanced age, which can result in regular growth and age.
For drugs or hormone treatment, child's age, development rate, growth rate, and emotional age depend on the condition.
Psychological aspects are also important.
There are reports of Caplovitz drugs, but admit, "Young people can increase their behavioral issues, and girls can feel different from their peers."
Another major problem can be understood: the parents don't just want their younger daughter to be a month-old.
Caplowitz said, "They're worried about getting pregnant, or how to keep it clean."
A woman whose daughter had started monthly religion at the age of 10 remembers, "It was a shock."
Although there were signs of this and we had also talked about mass religion, it wasn't emotionally prepared.
She was afraid of her school and returned troubled that she had started the first monthly religion in her classmates.
There are a lot of popular principles about the causes of asymptomatic youth.
However, there is no continuing evidence that hormones, chemicals, or media can be accused of a minor message in milk or other foods.
Boys - like girls - are getting early.
Caplowitz determines the rule that the main reason for this is the anger of stability.
She helped conduct a study of girls aged 6 to 9 in 2001, adding body weight to youth.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors contributing to it.
In this country, African-Americans and Spanish girls tend to get young before their teenage girls.
There are many explanations of this.
At global level, the representation of early youth, from economic situations to weather and genes, appears to be influenced by all things.
Other puzzles: Although boys are getting their faces and genital mutilation at a low age, the behavior of young girls is not as clear in them as it is.
Other physicians attending the AFP conference supported the complexity of the subject.
It is common for children and children to see the birth, and the birth, and the birth.
Dr. Lawrence Silverman says in the Goreeb Children's Hospital in New Jersey, Bal Medical Endocrinologist, Dr. Lawrence Silverman, "We need to be careful about how we recognize the real beginning of youth."
The parents should not be embarrassed to take guidance from their child physician to consider how to talk to their children.
Caplovitz advised, "It might have to talk before the expected time."
If you stay calm, your child will usually answer correctly.
Pre-Developing girls need to be assured that even if it's earlier than time, it's part of normal life.
On Tuesday, 3.1 degrees Celsius fell in temperature.
The rain and the cold fell on the people by night.
On the morrow they went out into the highways, and into the markets, and into their possessions.
The first rain of the cold has also been brought to light by the people.
People came in the morning and enjoyed the smoke.
As the weather changes, the heat and the disease will have a lot of relief, but then the cloud of smoke continues to be clouded all day long.
The children were also dressed in sweaters and arrived at their school.
There, according to the Airfors Weather Department, the maximum temperature was 25.1 degrees Celsius and 13.7 degrees Celsius.
Although 7.8 millimetres of rain has been recorded.
The clouds will remain above the sky, according to the weather section.
For the width of the seat, the argument is on the large orders of the jet manufacturers.
The two-month-old aerosols seem to have been in a fight by establishing a dispute between the flight manufacturers for long distance flights to the width of the passenger-class seats.
In the long flight, there is a focus on the width of the seat of the economic class, as always, not as if given by Airlines, but whose location has claimed to be key to the latest Jet Erbas SAS and Boing Company.
Erbus this week gives an extended seat of at least 18 inches (46 cm) at the Economy Cabin, which is expected to be such an Indian standard, but it should be determined by the Airlines by its chief presidential Boing.
The argument between the aircraft manufacturer comes when the largest version of the engine connected to the long-range Arcraft was sold after the 17-21 event.
How is the last section of the flight built - especially if sitting is 9 or 10 equal to the more capacity claims are being designed to take into account the design of the Mini Zambo jets?
Boing says it's "777 X" that will keep 406 people 17 in a row and 10 people in a single section.
Airbus says it's going to take 350 people to an 18-inch seat that's equal to 9 seats.
Air DGG often trades on technical matters through advertising in the commercial press.
Now, Airbus 777 X is hoping to catch more than 100 orders in Dublin with the Airbus 777 X, which is pushing the population forward.
Recently it's seen that there's nothing going on at the beginning of the war that shows this to Finnsero together in a restaurant will you accept it together?
Airbus sales chief John Lehei said that "Booing has been flying long in the vicinity from the regional turbo."
As a change, people are getting bigger, but there's no change in the way they sit.
According to data from the United States Health Department, in the 1970 ’ s, when Boing 747 twins of modern - day travel was defined as tha, and the average age of 40 - 49 - year - old American liver weight increased by 10 percent.
According to U.S. Health Statistics, the average man in the 21st century is 39.7 in the United States.
Airbus says its opponent is stuck with a 1950 sit-in when the new name was the middle line of the "jet set",
Airbus says he has set up a research commission to suggest an additional improvement in the quality of sleep in the width of the seat.
Boing argued on the figures of the seat size of the Airbus, and said that it does not depend on the decision of the manufacturers to hire airlines and balance between supplies.
It's also said that the research of the site depends on the experience of more cabins than the width of a seat.
Boing Kabin expert Kent Kraveer said, "It actually tells the lines and the things they believe they need to do to be successful."
"They don't want to tell us who they benefit."
They know their business better than anyone else.
It's about the kitchen room for the fliers, but it's a quick point for the customers to influence the ice.
At least 700 billion dollars of trade behind this dispute is estimated in the decades ahead of the US and European export competition.
The first time a Reuters report was reported in July, which is the point of the battle between the new jet planes in fact.
Airbus and Boing claimed 20 percent of the seat has been performed by their new related engine design leader, 365-Cit Boing 777-300.
Boing claims that the display depends on the 10 - volume 777 x [777 x] of the original 9 - volume 777 design.
The unit's profit is now used to compare 10 to the profit.
Kevin Kenston, Europe's Airbus Traveller's head says, "It's a Boing's flight to create more competition with our products and more seats."
On the other hand, analysts say that the entire 10-seat-by-line cabin is suggested for the current 777 S that a number of passengers are on the side of the Denser Laout, which can also be rented with rest..
Kabin, an internal expert, said: "It will be very good for the 18-year-old inn residents, but the reality is that this trading point of Airbus is run by the threat of 777"
Airbus and Boing do not provide seats, but provide a list of providers to choose for Airlines.
Also, the world's jet salesman is careful to check these layout contests.
As a result, all the buildings are also providing high-density air services and high-density flights for low-cost jet flights.
Airbus is giving it a 10 equal A350 but they say it's not sold yet.
But recently, Airbus stressed some of its jet planes on large cabin seats to require more cabin services.
It is not possible to fly to a new industry standard without the support of other designers of modern jet planes, but it can be detonated by the 777 X sales wave.
New anti-Nicotin vaccine can end the joy of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-Nicotine vaccine that can end the fun of smoking.
The same food in the vaccine, the rats were able to protect from Nicotine's latrine for the rest of their life.
Prior to the start of human trials, and the need for a trial, which may take several years, but in New York, Will Cornell Medical College professor Ronald Crystal said the physical signals are positive.
Professor Cornell said, "We are very hopeful that the strategy of such a vaccine can ultimately help millions of smokers who have tried to quit using all the existing methods in the market today, but they found that their status is much stronger than that of Nicotine."
The new vaccine has a degenerated virus that has been prepared for the purpose of creating anti-Nicotine antibiotics.
This virus, selectively inhibits the decomposed cell, which then begins to form a permanent stream of antibiotics.
Antibodies are looking for any nicotine in the blood, and preventing the absorption of nicotine in the smoker before reaching the brain.
In the test, the vaccine was given to those who were later given nicotine, and they continued their normal activity.
The investigators say that but what was not given was "well," a sign that Nicotine had reached his brain.
This use was described in the journal Science Translating Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines had failed because they had antibiotics.
It had to feed on regular intervals to maintain the level of antibiotics, but it proved to be important and unmanageable.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be high, because it will make the enteboded cell a factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the human vaccine of the future remained completely safe, it could be given to children, before the desire to smoke is over, so that they could be saved from nicotine.
But it will probably be used to stop smoking by people who smoke.
They said, "They'll know that if they start smoking again, they won't find any pleasure in smoking because of Nicotine's vaccine, which can help save their habit.
British scientists said that the outcome was shocking, but warned of the need for more research.
Even after Postmartm, the actual death of Baghin could not be covered.
The forest department is naturally describing the death of the first visible garden in response to this.
On Thursday night, the workers of the forest of Ramangar District found a garden well near the river Rezerv.
All the parts of the garden were secure, and there was no blemish in it, nor any blemish in it.
On Friday, the Sakt Bodola, DFO Qikasha Nimim, the SDO GS Carki, was posthumized by the HEMA Hema Rutora of the animal CTIR filled with medical care and the Kotabag animal.
According to sources, the interior noise of the garden is reported to be bad during postmartm.
This did not reveal the causes of the actual death of the garden.
District officials were responding to the death of the rain.
However, the interior parts of the garden have been sent to IVIRI Brazil for a topsycological test to confirm the sea.
The Wand Guardian West Circuit conscience panda said that the death of the garden can only be called natural.
There's no sign of a rainstorm.
However, it is also sending Bisra tests for the confirmation of the ship, along with the search for the surrounding area.
Tripod Obied refused to be influenced by us.
The former NSW Ministry of Labour will be tested by State Carpson Watchdog on Joa Tripod.
Former NSW Minister for Labour JOA tripods have refused to ask for the policy breakup of his political master A.D.O.O.B., former New South Wales defender A.D. O.O.D., whose government-controlled roles were hidden in three roles.
On Friday, the IACC expanded its investigation of whether Mr. Obied had violated the protocol of the policy of following by several state ministers? Where are the two restaurants and coffee owned by Obied, after the end of his reign of Tender in August 2005.
Lin Ashpole, after the witnesses given by the former Chief of Staff to Thursday, knew the secret self of Mr. Tripod of the charge, Mr. Obid?
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government was forced to start public tenders for boards.
The tapestries were against it and they wanted more time.
In 2009, Obied was renovated from the board’s factory firm, making it $25 million a year, without a board tender.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as entrance minister from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially on the side of the public tender.
But they refused to change at Mr. Obid's request, Mr. Tripodi asked for a change in government policy.
A photo of Mr. Obied and Mr. Tripod and Mr. Steve Dan, a senior official who came to the task of Mr. Obied after the construction of the port ministry in August and September 2007
Assistant Anthony Wheely asked Mr. Tripodi. "Was the development of the commercial policy being discussed in the telephone conversation?"
"No," Mr. Tripod answered.
I couldn't remember what I discussed, but it wasn't definitely.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obid.
Officials say that Israeli fighters shouted in Syria.
The Israeli warplanes set the city of Latakia as a goal on Thursday night at the port of Syria, a senior administrative officer confirmed the fact of the Fox News.
The authorities didn't tell us what was intended, but there was at least one purpose.
The report of the Associated Press states that the target was the Russian missile S.A.-125.
Israel has attacked the missiles in Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign workers can pass a "Credit" test on 457 networks
The government is considering a "validity" test for foreign workers on 457 visas, as it aims to extend a hard work.
If adopted, this test will be implemented by means of a command designed to prevent 457 family and friends who will be used in an exceptional way in Australia.
Today, a government debate was issued, condemning the government's previous liberator M.P. Maxine McQu today said it could upset the neighbouring countries of Australia.
Today, he told the American Indian Institute that "foreigners are arriving at the end of Qatar" and that "Australian people are at a very unpleasant juncture at a time when the Unions have demanded a safe labour market."
Historically, it was the commitment that white workers should be protected -- and if some people in the area have seen the echo of that historical witness, I will not be surprised.
The discussion letter shows the outline of the 12 instruments that were previously considered by Minister Chris Bowen.
Minister of Education Brandon O'Conner, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met with officials about the disbanding people, has implemented five structural changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the "Credit" command was adopted, the visa applicant's test can be carried out that "the name is true in situations in which the person named, the owner or personal partner of the person planning the visa, or the person with whom the visa is associated."
Businesses may need to count the number of 457 power holders, because the first business that wanted to design fewer workers has put hundreds of people at work.
During this time, 35-year-old Sri Lankan refugee, died of a heart attack after entering a refugee ship on Christmas Island.
And there came with him into Australia his father's house about nine years of age; and his father's brother had a linen cloth brought unto him, which he had laid upon his father's breast.
The Australian authorities took him to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The British government has announced a study for growth in the benefits of the HS2 rail project in Scotland.
Work by HS2 encourages high-speed services in the northern part of Scotland and England, which will soon begin with the first step in 2026.
Transport Minister Burones Kremer said the project would be "British One".
Scotland's Transport Minister Keith Brown said they are very "encouraged" by working with the British government on this project.
The first step will include a new high-speed rail line between London and West Midlands.
When the second step is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and Lides.
In June, the government revised the cost of building a high-speed link between London and Northern England to £327.7 billion and revised £42.6 billion.
The British government, which was discussing Scotland's transport, instructed HS2 to consider rail capacity and time for northern England and Scotland and the possibilities of making better travel.
This includes the possibility of a three-hour trip from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
According to Berones Cream: "Our goal for HS2 is a real national network that will bring Yukon and its cities closer."
We're moving forward with HS2, because it's going to be a lot more.
Without it, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it's also about the connectivity of 18 British cities with Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be linked to HS2.
According to Scotish Sequential Elistier Karmicel: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed for "clear" back to Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "Scotland is likely to benefit heavily from high-speed rails, but this will also increase the financial burden on Scotland in the case of high-speed rails in the whole of Britain.
Therefore, we are encouraged to work in the British government's participation so that we can check options to bring high-speed rails to Scotland, create benefits for all, and meet the Glasgow-Ednburg line, which the Scottish government is already planning.
I am eager to review the test report with the British government ministers next year and to take decisions together on the next action.
Air Power Tools Regulations Will Be Effective Now in Australia
In spite of the mild action taken in the device management in the US, Australian air passengers must continue to shut down their tablets and smartphones when they fly and fly down.
The U.S. Aviation Administration has left open the option to change US Air Services companies' processes to enable travel e-book reading, viewing videos or playing games on their devices during major flight steps, while remaining in "Viaion" mode.
Travelers can still do so during many flights, but many people do not like to be able to access their e-book, when they fly and fly.
Australian Air Services companies are considering the decision that US Air Services companies will be working much more to meet this need, but they have indicated that they have no immediate plans to change their processes.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said that it is considering the announcement, but insisted that the use of power tools is still effective in important flight steps in Australia.
"In the present case, CASA has no specific arrangement to control the benefits of energy devices in the air," the author said, "this is within the administrations, according to which air service companies must ensure that the security system has always been fully established, and that passengers must comply with the security instructions given by the members of the operator group."
Virgin, who is already talking to CASA about expanding the use of her in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to apply this change, but she said to act on the Wynamic's instructions.
The speaker said, "We will welcome the review by CASA in the case of the use of energy devices, because we really think it will give customers a better experience, because we now have (wireless in-fleet entertainment) in our flights.
Quantas said that it will now comply with the current rules.
He said, "We can't use electric devices when we're flying and landing according to our current policy, and we don't have an immediate plan to change it."
FAA's decisions apply to the U.S. Airline.
So, we're always interested in dynamic developments that can benefit travelers and we'll definitely consider the decisions of the FAA and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision, each US air service company will be different and will depend on the age of their flight.
Air service companies will need to confirm that their aircraft can tolerate radio execution by mobile devices, as well as they will have to investigate their rules for books, training materials, car-on luggage programs and for short details.
FAA said, "After the Airline's approval of their aircraft's tolerance, it will allow passengers to use light weight, such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones, which can be held at all heights."
In low-visibility cases, the pilot team will direct passengers to stop their devices when they land.
The group has also suggested that heavy equipment be placed safely below the seat or in the upper decks while filling and landing.
Ponbrokers’ money because of the hard feelings of the middle class in Singapore
In Singapore, the Bendemir Shopping Center in Ponshop, Janny Amirthalinga is taking a bribe to pay her daughter's school fee for her gold rings, rings, and thumbs.
She said, “My husband and I have recently bought a house, so our money has been wasted.”
They say, although they earn 3,000 Singapore dollars (U.S. $2,400) as a prime minister, and their husband also works, but the family's monthly income is not enough.
In fact, in parts of South-East Asia -- where the house is growing in debt -- Valumex, where they're making their landings, has become a third panshop listing Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
There is not only a way to keep the bank down - 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of the Sussari Amirthaling - but almost unsecured bank lon for as long as it stands.
In Singapore, Ponbroker usually borrows 17 per cent per year, which is slightly more than 15.4 per cent of the United Supervised Bank, which has a local loan in the same shopping center.
However, Ponbrokers do not have the benefit of checking the credit or the amount of credit, and they can make loans faster than the bank.
Millions of people in this area are struggling to cope with the increasing cost of living and housing and user loans.
Up to five years after the global financial disaster, strong growth, and a pon-shop to meet the needs of the low- and middle-aged families, following a stable policy of moral policy, are expanding the pan-shop to meet their needs.
This week's rating agency, the Standards Ange Powers, has reported on the growing domestic benefits due to the growing Mortgage, for the supervision of Asian banks.
He said that in Asia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore, there are the highest households in the ratio of household to household.
Malaysia has 80 percent of GDP in this list at the highest level, while in 2008 it was 60 percent.
Economics in Thailand are concerned about the high levels of consumer loans, which have risen slightly from a technical point of view this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a constant decrease in export volumes and users' demand.
In Malaysian Bank, C.I.M.B., economist Song Song Wun said, "The key point is that with increased prices, people coming from the lower class will try to increase their income in every way possible."
In the past two years, high values of gold have historically driven people to lose their personal property, because they are taking advantage of the opportunity to value their family's possessions.
In Singapore, 70 percent of the gold that has been captured in the 200-pound outlet of the city are gold.
People say, "The feeling of sleep is good, let's keep Grandpa's mother's gold ring down, and take her back next month.
The largest pan-shop operator in Thailand, Ejimney, has seen 20 percent of customers using their outage in recent months.
There is such an increase in the decline business that in Bendmir, the director of the Outlet in Volumex and in Singapore, 15 others, not only in their neighbors, are planning to expand in Malaysia where it has four shops, but also planning to expand outside Asia, the executive director of Valumex says, or Le Ching.
The company will use $66 million of Singapore's $60 per cent on Singapore Stock Exchange this week's listing.
While high interest rates have caused some disauntled Landers (debts), Susheri Yah says that falling down is not only a constant rate compared to other lenders, but it does not necessarily increase in borrowing.
They say, "The customers trap things that they already have, and they don't increase the loss of personal property in the home.
Social acceptance of ponbrokking is increasing to provide temporary and secure financial assistance.
It's not that Ponbrokers only use a financially weak person.
The rich people in Singapore also use the Valumex outlet, they have gold bars or rock clocks that can pay up to 60 percent of their purchases.
We have customers of all classes of society.
She says, "These include rich people who need to borrow for a short time for practical activities or investments, or small businesses who need to meet their current needs."
Sometimes they just need some time.
India's largest businessman Mukash Imbani, Wif Nitta Imbani, is celebrating his 50th birthday on November 1, 2013.
The law is not in Mumbai, but in Mumbai.
They organized a very large party on this occasion.
To join this party, many big stars from Bolivia arrived as soon as possible. On the late 31st of October, several large stars were seen picking up as soon as the flight took place at Mumbai Airport.
These are the stars of Kerishma Kupur, and the music of Bozra, and the song of Winod Kangna, and their waif Kwaita Kupura, and the islands of Malik, and Shakar Kupur, and the kingdom of Kumari Hirani, and the Rakash Om Light Mehra, and the name of Rahul Bos Adi.
Obviously, when you get so big names in the party, you can figure out how big it will be.
325 million dollars to protect the health of Tagi
The United States government has stressed that 325 million dollars in the health system is also in the process of becoming ill, which will ensure that the government is not able to eradicate the government's duty.
U.S. Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the National Assembly, the island's old population, the high rate of genetic diseases, and "fast-acting" to address the current crisis because of the system's limitations.
The decision to provide for four years was made after the government's advice with the free nation of Tasmania, Andrew Wilke.
Ms. Plibersek said today, "The government has an emergency rescue package, which we believe will solve the specific challenges facing the government.
The $325 million package includes an alternative surgery plan for 31 million dollars.
With orthopaedic and morphine surgeons, 2,600 additional operations, will help to resolve the last collected cases.
It also includes resources to start the personal electronic health archive system in the training of medical experts, mental health services, and local hospitals after going to the Wok-in Clinic.
Ms. Plibersek said, "These interventions are in line with the best ways I've been told to improve the health system in Tasmania by early physicians."
The minister stressed that the government of Tasmania would face severe reporting and accountability.
The government must maintain the current level of financial resources to obtain national funds, and report monthly where additional duties are being carried out.
Three members will be grouped to ensure that they are served in an effective and efficient manner by the government.
Mr. Wilke said that 325 million dollars would not be much more, "until real improvements are made to the public health system in Tasmania to achieve a more reasonable level."
Yet, they praised the government for responding to their urgent request for help, which they brought to the prime minister at the beginning of May."
Mr. Wilke said, "I hope that the Union's assistance package will be very helpful in separating the state's public health system from the crisis list."
According to the government, these additional alternative processes will mainly reverse recent generations.
But the U.S. Air Force believes that the announcement of today's "band-ed solution" is a health-related phenomenon.
He said to the BBC TV, "We're here because the lab state government has taken $430 million in its health system.

The monitoring group said that Syria has destroyed its ability to build its chemical weapons
The group monitoring Thursday said that Syria has destroyed important tools for building chemical weapons and nuclear gas war materials, while a major conflict arose in northern Syria, which is very close to the location where the Special Agents are considered.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian Adolescent Group said that about three years ago, about 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the Syrian home war.
This announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before the end of November 1.
The Hege-based organization has designated Damascus to destroy or "make unaffected" the machinery used to produce all chemical weapons and chemical gases and fill in the war material.
The main completion of the initial phase of the destruction, in this major event, is the stone of the nuclear mile aimed at destroying all the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
Destroying the device means that Syria can no longer make a new chemical weapon.
Although Damascus still has to destroy existing weapons and collections.
Syria is thought to have now 1,000 metric tons of chemical and weapons, including Master Gas and Norwegian Agent Sirine.
The British situation is reported by the Syrian observatory for Human Rights that the announcement occurred when Thursday grew in the battle in Sapphira, which experts believe is the chemical weapon production unit and the storage centre.
The movement group that describes the number of deaths through the network of gangs in Syria told Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
He said that of these 6,365 children are 61,067 ordinary citizens.
According to the government, 29,954 are members of the military forces of President Bashar Abad, 18,678 are fighters on the side of the government and 187 are Lebanese Hizbullah.
He also said that there are 2,202 troops in the dead and about 5,375 refugees, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25 July, U.N. estimated that nearly 100,000 people died in the war that has been in progress since March 2011.
It hasn't updated the data since.
About 20 million people are forced to leave the country because of this conflict.
Assad's army was fighting rebels in Sapphira for weeks, many of which were related to groups.
On Thursday, the observatory said that people were killed on both sides, but clearly said nothing.
This war represents the threat faced by arms inspectors, who have a very limited time-limit, a mission to end the deadly weapons in Syria during the ongoing war at home.
The U.P.C.D.Blu, which works with the United Nations, said in a statement that its group "is now satisfied and confirmed - and has seen all the important products announced by Syria and the mixing/filling devices - destroyed."
He also said, "There is no monitoring plan anymore."
At the beginning of this week, observers said that they had completed the first step of the confirmation work by Damascus on 21 of the 23 centres announced by Damascus.
The observers said that they were not able to go to two centres for security reasons.
On Friday, O.P.D.Blu said that according to Syria, these two centers "have been abandoned and... the chemical weapons that have been stored there have been brought to other declared centres, which have been monitored."
It was not immediately apparent that the unit in Sapphira, one of the two centres, was not able to be monitored by the O.P.C.W.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which will be approved by the O.P.C.D. Working Committee next month.
O.P.C.D.Blu said, "I greet the strength and courage you have shown by the people to fulfill the most challenging mission that this organization has ever done."
This house war has lasted for three years, mainly by the government of Inad and its security forces, including members of the Alavit sect, and the rebellion among Sunni Muslims.
In another event, Rami Abdurrahman, the chief of the arbitration, said that Wednesday had been severely exploded in Syria's coastal region of Latvia at the Air Defens Centre.
He said that this explosion is not known yet.
The police have taken photos of online records, online stamps, laptops, and web-registers.
Moti City Police has filed charges against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Demagitat Singh Gil explained that in the arresters, the royal arval of the city of Habowal, Urph Bintu, the clay of the round tabernacle, the silver of the lion's den of the rock, and the gold of the golden calf of the moon, are included in the accusations.
The register office (former) has been disconnected from the power of the lion.
According to police charges, Clark and Recordwriters were taking papers from the records of empty and old land and then buying new stamps and making online registers on them.
This was not the case after the original registry was lost in the register.
After that, they sold the land for millions of dollars on the net.
There, they were taking lead on the paper.
After that, the real owner of the land continued to be oppressed by police and administration.
The complainants who made the online registers were especially interested in the lands of NRAIG.
Because there's no one to oversee NRAIG's land.
So it's easy to sell online registers of these lands.
Police Commissioner Gill reported that the accused reported in the questionnaire that they have prepared network records of approximately 150.
According to the police, there are always cases of fraud and theft against the political leaders.
A Cry for a Bomb Exploitation in Bali
In 2002, the relatives and relationships of the 202 people who were killed in the bomb in 2002 cried out to the bomb blaster's executioner, saying that the Ummer Plaque should face the firing team.
The Plaque, which has been running away as one of the most wanted in South-East Asia for nearly 10 years, has been announced for its 20-year term in the building of the explosive device used in the bomb explosion.
He can be released for 15 years after he's given the password.
The 45-year-old Umr, who was attacked in two night clubs in the famous tourist area of Kota, was found guilty of mass murder, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and many people were injured.
He was also found guilty of many other charges related to terrorism, including the serial bomb explosion in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The organizers had asked for the punishment of Agenivo Karav, even though they could have demanded that this person who is called the "destructive person" be executed as a bomb maker.
This decision revitalized the painful memories of a woman who lives in the cave, June Cortini, who lost her 39-year-old daughter in a devastating attack by her supporters and her supporters for a decade ago.
He stopped his appetites and said that the executioner should have been executed.
I really feel that he should be punished just as much as any other terrorist.
Ms. Cortin said to the A.P., "He should be set up in front of the firing team."
I have to live without my family and my daughters every day.
On 12 October 2002, just after 11 a.m., the club was removed after the bomb explosion in the standing van outside the All Club.
Peter Hughes, a bagpack full of explosives by suicide attackers, was in the PD bar 20 seconds before the explosion.
As a result of this bomb explosion, they went to a long coma for a month and were three times "dead" while living on life-saving devices.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should have received the same sentence as that of the other three members of the terrorist group, American, Muslim and Imam, who were killed four years ago.
In fact, this person must be executed before someone else dies.
Look at him, and see, he has no reason to live.
After killing 202 people and killing countless people, 20 years of punishment is not enough.
Pate, the last one to be punished by the Bali Bomb blasts.
He remained in custody for about a decade, but eventually in January 2011, he was arrested in Abtabad, Pakistan, where the U.S. Army had recently killed former Chief Osama Bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, F.B.I.A. Agents submitted evidence that the report revealed that the South-East Asian terrorist groups and the recent attempt to re-establish contact with Bill Laden was in Pakistan to meet.
Ms. Cortin says, "He didn't commit himself."
Even today, he doesn't really have the pain of hurting so many people.
This decision came before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
She said, "This year there will be a lot of tears."
Yet the pate can appeal against his sentence.
F.A.: Air travel can now use gases in the air (but can't call the cell phone)
The airman will be able to read, work, play games, watch the music, use his electronic device from entering the gate, but they will not be able to talk to their cellphones - such a master continues to be involved in the most anticipated new directional directions by the United Air Administration.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
At a news conference, the F.A. administrator, Michael Huarta, said that how fast these changes are implemented, it will be different in each line.
Airlines will show F.A. how their aircraft, new directional instructions, and how to update the rules for the training books of their crew members and for the collection of devices.
F.A. has already taken plans to extend the use of portable electronic devices on the plane.
Delta and Zetblu are among the lines that have already submitted plans.
F.A. said in a statement, "On the basis of the state of the plan, we can accept the extended use of the electronic device very soon.
As a result, passengers need to close their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the air is closed.
They are expected not to proceed until they reach the altitude of 10,000 feet of the plane and are permitted by the Captain.
Travelers are expected to re-stop their devices when they land on the plane, and do not operate until the plane is completely down.
The F.A. said that within new directional directions, airlines whose aeroplanes are fully secure, can allow their passengers to fly by air, when they land, and when they use the devices during taxis.
Most new airline companies and other aircraft that have been revised so that passengers can use a more high wave are expected to comply with these commands.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Agents, has welcomed these changes.
Glading said in a statement, "When policy is safely implemented -- and we'll work with Airlines companies to do that -- it'll be a win-win for both sides."
When it comes to this point, we've gone out of touch with the Hall Monitors.
Agency said that, however, it will still be banned by connecting to less than 10,000 feet of Internet access, providing e-mails, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data.
Travelers will be told to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in an airplane mode.
So there can still be no conversation with friends, such as the online Scrable game, which is related to the famous event that the US Airlines had dropped them when Act Elek Baldwin was playing on their smartphone while the air park was at the door in 2011.
And a heavy device like laptop etc still has to be collected because they're going to worry about hurting someone else in the cabin.
The phone calls will continue to be blocked during the flight.
The administrative authority associated with the phone call is near the communication foundation, not the F.A.
F.A. can remove restrictions on some electronic devices when flying and landing.
Last month, the Mark Daykenn of the National Transportation Safety Unit, a national safety expert in C.B.S. News, said that cell phone is still considered to be critical.
Roženker said, "The cell phone is really a serious issue, not just because they can possibly produce regulation in the navigation-related device, but also because they can produce regulation in the cell phone towers when they are in the air.
In order to examine this issue, the World Advisory Committee, composed of F.A., has proposed that the government should allow more use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, F.A. has been increasing pressure to reduce restrictions on their use.
Mr. Claire MacSchilk, such as D-Mo, has said that there is no valid security reason for the ban.
These restrictions are becoming more difficult because the use of the device is widespread.
Some studies also show that nearly three passengers forget or ignore instructions to stop their device.
F.A. began to block the use of electronic devices by travelers in 1996, when F.M. radio and high-tech passengers received a report on the regulation in navigation and communication devices.
New Airlines companies, compared to the last generation of aircraft, are more dependent on the electrical system, but they are also designed and approved to resist electronic intervention by F.A.
Airlines has been proposing the use of wi-fi on cruise heights for years.
The revised flights for the Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to the regulation.
Huarta said that most airlines should be able to use more of the electronic device within the new direction.
Today’s electronic device emits very low-power radio transmission compared to the last generation electronic device.
For example, e-readers transmit the full name when the page is flipped.
But the transmission is powerful when downloading or sending data from the device.
Amazon.com is also one of the parties to the ban on the use of the device by travellers.
In 2011, the company's officials uploaded their entire control e-readers to Airlines and sent them to investigate problems but no such problem was found.
The F.A.S. Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the device’s work.
The Douglas Kid of the National Air Traveling Association said they believe that the device is real, even if it's called the device.
The other members of the committee said that only the pilot reports described by pilots, most of which are very old, are supported by the device to be dismantled in the Aircraft system.
However, members of the committee suggested that F.A.P.L. allow pilots to order passengers to stop the device when they are less visible.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed changes and they have said the general knowledge of the people who travel in the most recent period of the industry.
U.S. Travel Association C.I. Roger Do said that we are pleased that the F.A. has recognized that a joyful traveler is not inseparable with safety, safety and safety.
Learning from the terrorist threats on board, the U.S. police have taken a room for the security guard's fire department and during the emergency.
In order to ensure the proper functioning of this system, the banning of speedy events, and the training of the minds will be followed by a total of 1,800 patrolling and foot patrolling vehicles in all major locations in the city of the army.
These young people will include P.R.R., women with traffic units.
The city's hotels, guest houses, and other places with PGI will check out the police workers and commands carefully and carefully.
THANA SCHO has been instructed to organize a special investment team (SIT) for a case evaluation.
In addition, DSP with Jimma Inspector has been assigned to check markets, malls and other locations with the city's VIP sectors.
In the wake of the emergency and the holiday of Dilali, senior officials have also set a duty for additional police officers in the police control of the people's relief.
The police have been told to maintain high-altitude with the staff of other distributors in the meantime, in addition to the administration of the DMCS and the director of the PGI, the principal director and DCHS.
In order to teach minds, the regional authorities have now put others, including women police workers, under the leadership of Ngio, called 'Anti Guda Staff' on Twitter.
Anti-Gunda Staff team will be able to hold the minds of people in simple police clothes, with markets and markets.
All SCHOs have been ordered to put 44 noses in the inner areas of the city.
At the city's borders, 38 Naka points will remain at the police station.
Birds were released by air transport to the forest for protection from the North Sea.
The birds found on the North C Oil Reig have been abandoned by air transport from the beach back to the forest.
The bird named this road train was sent by Scotish SPCA before Helicopter was sent back to his Eloa Rescue Center.
Central Administrator Colin Sedan said: "This road rail was probably a winter passenger bird from northern Europe, which came into the air at a speedy speed above the North Sea."
It seems that the bird was tired and took refuge in the Oil Ridge.
They said, “He was unable to fly again, so we were called to help.”
Before leaving, the road was healthy and healthy.
Is Europe ready to deal with Britain?
In April, Business For Britain was launched and the business was promised to bring together and determine what changes the U.K. journalist and prosperity creator want to see in our relationship with the U.K.
For him, we asked them what they thought about Britain's business with the E.U., by organizing the largest and most extensive surveys of British professional leaders.
U-Gov has been responsible for the ideas of 1000 business leaders, representing the size of Britain's business, areas and places.
The conclusion of this survey may be surprising to many people.
We found that a large part of the businesses now want to export out of Europe, and want to focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while the EU member countries are invincible.
They want the government to give priority to new business relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than to the long-term and bad process of reforming the U.S. secret organizations.
When a single government asked their views about specific policy areas such as the product law, most business leaders believed that the control of these crucial capabilities should return to Westminster.
The single market could easily be seen as a source of unhappiness, the businessmen say that the cost of the management of Brussels is far more than the benefits of becoming part of the European commercial sector - even that large businesses that were traditionally part of European companies agreed on this.
In the end and most clearly, our survey of practical leaders found that, a large part clearly wants Britain, the U.S., to move forward on the road to trade-based relations and changes.
This conclusion, which was seen in the main business groups levels, showed that the business is moving towards a "society change" that would give the U.S. a loss of power.
This is a very high price - the issue of changing terms for Britain and obtaining a better solution in the non-storey, U.S., has changed 16 percent of the cost of living in the United States.
The prime minister should not be in any doubt: the survey is that British businessmen support their plan to talk about British membership conditions in the U.S.
It also showed that businessmen expect to re-report the current power balance to the US side by making a financial change.
A better solution is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming necessary very quickly, because the Eurozone, the restored economy and the political association are moving forward.
Priority must be given to jobs and growth in Britain, as the conclusions of our survey show that this means a new focus on trade and a change in the management method of Brussels.
Alexi Miller of Gazprom told the pipeline in Bulgaria that it was a new era.
The chief of Gazprom said that the start of the construction of the South Stream Pipeline in Bulgaria marked the start of Europe's largest energy projects.
"Today there has been a historic event: the construction of the Bulgarian part of the South Stream Gas Pipeline, which is the largest and most important project in Europe," Alexi Miller, president of Gazprom, said in a statement to Thursday.
The project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream will provide diversity in Russian export routes in Europe.
The authorities said that Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas for Europe is a part of the gas, presents a dialogue on the relationship between gasprom and gasprom.
Maire said that a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, is to end the joint agricultural and political efforts associated with the countries of transition.
Following the start of the whole project in 2015, Bulgarian customers will receive gas at free rates from the South Stream.
Gazeprom said that the contraction should begin in other Downstream countries by the end of the year.
This pipeline is designed for the annual capacity of the 2.2 trillion cubic feet of nachiral gas.

Prior to the accusations against Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission reported on two employees of the U.S.A.
Prior to the charge against Jonathan Lord, in 2011 the Caringbah Child Care Officer, W.M.C.A.N.S.D.Blu, has been charged with two Bal Young Offenders.
But in his statement in front of the foundation, he said that it "never came up with Bal Young's persecution within his organization," the foundation was told.
Chief officer Philip Harre was asked about the case in which a member of the U.S.S.A. was charged with child pornography, and another case in which the U.S.C. Caringaba was charged with child abuse in 1991 against children living in his care.
Mr. Harre said they knew about the first case, but they didn't know about the second case.
They also admitted that the U.M.S.A.'s statement that "the outside of the U.S.A. has been tested and that they have found the U.S.A. in the field of child protection" is not true.
With respect to the foundation, it is evidence that WA.M.C.A. was notified, and this year it received a secondary rating in the four possible ratings in education and community departments in August.
Mr. Hare, who is associated with the 21-year-old W.M.S.A., admitted that the "self-with-me" provision had failed by appointing the Lord, and failed to ensure that workers were clearly aware of their duties related to informing child security policy violations.
In the beginning of this year, Lord, was convicted of juvenile crimes with 12 children during the two-year term in the U.S.A.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in Carabah.
But Mr. Harre refused the suggestion that there was a cultural problem in W.M.C., which did not cause the workers to report a violation of the Bal Security by Lord.
The workers gave what they saw about the violation, to the Witnesses who spent their time alone with the children by Lord, to personally harass them, to say to them that he loves them, and to allow them to play on their mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was in the Lord's custody, and he was talking about the Child Security Training, because he was concerned about his behavior, testified that the W.M.C.A.'s observer for the Lord's Careting Child Service provider, Jackie Bernard, was "hard to find a very threatening and most time".
C.I.O. said he did not accept the witness of the workers that they were not easy to inform their manager.
He said, rather, their friendship with Lord led to their decision to inform them about him.
Mr. Harre said that he had given the W.M.S.A.N.S.D.Blu to the Assembly his view that the text for the organization "not to be informed" was from the "John Lord event".
Mr. Harre said that shortly after the charges were brought, the decision to sign the confidentiality agreement was made by Lee Whitee, the Bal Service Manager of the U.S.S.A.
He said it was intended to avoid involvement with the witness, but it was not "enthusiastic" and was not executed correctly.
Professor Stephen Malbon of the University of Gryphith said that during the work of Jonathan Lord between 2099 and 2011, W.M.C.E.N.S.D.Blu was not a safe organization.
He said there were "critical problems" in the appointments, surveys, access, training and surveillance of workers.
The hearing has been suspended for 20 December.
Blier says they want Britain back.
Tony Blair said they'd want to be Britain's prime minister again - but they believe there's no way back.
At the time of the fifth anniversary of their education by the Prime Minister's office, 59-year-old Blair expressed his opinion on various household nyots.
After leaving office as leader after a decade in June 2007, most of his comments on foreign affairs and the role of peacemakers in the Middle Group limited Mr. Blair's role to a considerable extent to discuss British politics.
When asked if they would like to return to the prime minister's office, Mr. Blair was presented by the London Evining Standard newspaper, saying, "Yes, yes, but that's not possible, so..."
They urged the leaders not to ignore the commercial community after the financial crisis.
When the Cardiff had gathered a crowd of experts who displayed the horse for the greatest horse of the year, they knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not yet at the university and a few months away from taking its first step, this little kid and his palate Shetland's Tutu Taphi easily completed three steps and received the top award - he left behind his 30-year-old opponents.
In the annual contest organised by the Saninback Equestrian Center in Cardiff's near Rudrey, a couple who could not be separated - which is the length - were greatly praised for their performance, behavior and style.
In front of men and women dressed in beautiful baller hats, he pushed his flat top on a bead and ringed his two-year-old tophy.
The decision-makers commended Fenton for his natural skills in controlling his age.
And Tofi got the highest score for his performance and personality.
Fenton was given a gift on his third birthday last March, and since then he has studied with this day-to-day setlund.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fenton and Tony are a wonderful couple."
They had to face all expectations, but they both won Gold Cup and Rosette.
It was only the second time he was in a competition with Toffi, and we are all very happy to win it.
The most different in this color field, he seemed so wonderful to everyone that they wanted to take photos with him.
Eb Well, near the South Wales village of Nantiglo, this small child is walking on his anti Sharon Howells tracks that have been showing horses for more than 10 years.
Mr. Howells said: "The whole place was filled with enthusiasm, and everyone was enjoying and playing."
He was running to and fro in all the field, and did extraordinary things in spite of the appearance of his eyes.
Fenton is a wild animal -- he loves horses, tractors and fields, and he has two birds he cares for.
As he started, he'd be the greatest horse in the year long -- and I trust he'd be very good.
The speaker for the annual horse show said: "Fenton's life is only three years, but he comes to control his bow."
They're a very good couple.
The decision-makers gave the figures, the manners of Fenton's and Toffi's display, and their presentation in the show ring.
He saw good team work between Tttu and his riders - the best in the Fenton and Tophy ring in the case.
I firmly believe that Fenton's loving clothes helped him, he was really looking very different.
The Chinese magazine that argues will be the "sweetback"
A Chinese newspaper, which had an appeal on the front page to release a manhani's conviction, will be rescinded, said a press scientist.
The newspaper New Express of Guangzhou provided a real public argument for the release of journalist Chen Yongjo.
But after that, Mr. Chen agreed on TV that he had agreed to write a thorough report on the part of the government.
Wynjamk said that the new expression now has to go through "full correction".
The command of the "snake" came from the Guangdong Press and the publication, radio, film and television administration.
"A primary test showed that the New Express of the Younging Evanning News Group had published many false news about the Listed Company Jumloin in the mid-September 2012 period.
Wynjamk said in a statement that "the editorial arrangement of the new expression was unorganized."
He said that he had decided to punish an administrative penalty by canceling the license of Chen Yongjo's reporter.
He instructed the Young Evening News Group to make a complete revision of the new expression, to test the people responsible for it in the new expression, and to immediately investigate the lead group of the new expression."
Mr. Chen wrote in New Express many articles condemning financial irregularities in a company called Jumloin.
After they were released, their newspaper published two front pages for their release, and said that he supported the mail of Mr. Chen.
But after that, Mr. Chen agreed to write and publish false stories about money on Kingdom TV.
He told C.T.V.: "In this case, I have damaged the ability of Jumloin and the entire news industry and people to win the faith."
I did this mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I've realized my mistakes.
After Mr. Chen's apology, New Express continued to apologize, saying it had failed to check their report correctly.

From 23 November to 23 November, Mr.Hindu will write a text of Mr.Hunman's protest against the National Anti-Front President Mandragit Singh Bithta with 10 thousand children.
This information was provided by Bituta, the chief prosecutor of Mr. Hindu justice's back, the leader of the Dung and Aswani killing, the Gandhi Bunga, the Regit Jan, the Banti Bzaz, the Raman Kósla, and Bantu and the Invil Sharma, after inviting them to the public.
They praised Mr. Hindu's efforts to add children to everlasting culture through justice.
He said that children also need to be taught religious teachings with secular education for the unity and infinity of the country.
The U.S.-Mexico drug mine found its own train

The British police sent Ashe a gift note
The British police sent a letter to Julian Asanze, the founder of Wikilix, today, who has taken refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London and applied for refuge.
Scotland Yard said that he had sent 40-year-old Australian Assets a "emerging note" that they would have to attend the police station, and that they would be responsible for being arrested if they failed to do so.
As well, young criminals are faced with a trial in Sweden, and their options under British law have ended when the Supreme Court rejected their appeal against the trial in the beginning of this month.
Stokhom would send them to the U.S., with this fear, they called from the South American country for political refuge, asked for refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London on June 19th.
One speaker said that Scotland Yard sent "40-year-old Assja a suicide note that required them to attend the police station on the date and time they were elected."
They are in violation of the conditions of their strength.
The angel refused to comment on the release of police notes.

Performing foreign property on owners, will end London's creative position
The Department of Finance has calculated primarily C.G.T. measures, but is awaiting the final decision from Mr. Osburn, who presented a 7-percent stamp tweet for the 2012 budget of 2 million pounds, as well as a person who prefers to have a home in a company instead of a different person.
In 2012/13, Stamp Dutt 708 million pounds were available from residential properties in the cities of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, which are already more than the combined sum of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North West and Yorkshire and Hamburg.
Mr. Cook said: "After an increase in the stamp of high-value houses and an Associated Anti-Avoidance statement has been presented, it is very difficult to argue that there is less tax on the high-value property, which is not related to the influence of the system since it has been old.
They added, "But this step can make some foreign immigrants reluctant to buy property in London and to sell existing owners"
The primary proportion, according to the value in South-West London, has increased by 11.8 percent last year's record in the top 5 to 10 percent of the home market, which has spread from Flemish to Vimbledon.
According to the search for Seville, the values of Central London continued to increase regularly by 5.6 per cent each year, but it was expected to be slightly lower compared to the "Garleu market" because the city's southern west, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent).
Scientists have also shed light on the relationship between the dog's feathers and its mucous membranes.
Recent research has shown that happy dogs move their tail more to the right (from the point of view), while bechan dogs move their tail more mainly to the right.
But now scientists have said that partners can identify and respond to this narrow secret of dogs.
This study has been published in the Journal of the Court of Justice.
From the University of Trento, neuroscientist Professor Georgia Wellertigara said: "People know that the left and right parts of the brain are different from the emotions that produce positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to see it in other nations as well.
They told him that the right hand of the head was responsible for the acts of the left hand and for the contrary, and that the two were subject to different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to each other’s movements through other dogs, researchers looked at animals in the movies of other dogs.
They measured the beatings of the heart of the child dogs and analyzed their behavior.
We probably won't take more time to understand why their tails sometimes move to each other.
Prof. Wellertigera said, "We presented dogs with dog movies -- in a shadow-shaped version or in a mirror to deal with other points that would cause confusion, and we could see the work of the dog and present the dog to the left or the right."
And it came to pass, when the cattle saw that the dog was driven back and forth, that they were very much at ease.
But when they saw the bird shifting to the left, their hearts were moved and they looked uneasy.
According to Professor Wellertigar, they don't think dogs were communicating with each other through these things.
Instead, they believe that dogs have learned from their experience what activity they should be concerned about and not about.
They said, "If you have found other dogs, and if they keep moving on to one side, it is more likely that they will have a relationship with you, and the right hand will offer you a lesser degree of friendship. You will react by the same experience."
Researchers say that these conclusions can provide better information about animal emotions to owners, animal doctors and educators.
John Bradshaw, an expert in dog behavior at the University of Bristol School of Water Sciences, said that it is not the first study to examine whether the left or right part of the dog is important.
Last year, the University of Linking team found that when dogs see an acrobatic dog, they turn their heads to the left and turn their heads to the right when they see the happy dog.
In another search for the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "In contrast to Italian study - when the robot dog was moved to the left of the bird's right, it was more likely that the dog would get lost than it was near."
They said it was because dogs in different studies didn't really smell animals in animal movies or robots.
They explained that this could help to study a way of reacting to dogs.
"Although the various stems have found enough evidence that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, there is still more information to be found - and there are no dog exceptions in this case," he said.
Although, in view of the ease with which their conduct can be attributed, it seems that we will probably not find more time to understand why their two are sometimes moving to each other.
Because of Alex Turner’s illness, Arctic Manchus suspended Glasgow Giga
Rock Bank, named Arctic Manchiz, has established Giga in Glasgow after being beaten by his main singer.
The Sheffield Group program was set up to show on the Hidro site in Friday.
But their leading singer Alex Turner's disease forced them to redefine the date of the show.
The band's announcement came at the time when they were forced on Thursday to stand in LG Erina in Burma in the same way.
In commenting on his official website, Arctic Manchise said: After taking medical advice, after a decision to set up a show in Bermuda LG Arena tonight, Arctic Manchise must also set up a show in Glasgo Hydro on November 1st.
"Alex Turner was found in the junk, and they're not painfully capable of displaying."
The show will be held in LG Erina in Burma on 20 November, and the exhibition will be held on 21 November in Glosgo Hydro.
All tickets will be accepted for this show.
We're sorry for any inconvenience that's going to happen to all the ticket holders.

Pope Francis will announce the name of the first Cardinal in February
Vatican has announced Thursday that Pope Francis will make the new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his work.
Cardinals, in the Catholic Church, are the clergy of the highest class, their rank is only down from the pope, and they choose the pope, so France will appoint the first group of its people, who will eventually help to choose their successor.
Now there are 201 cardinals.
Similarly, after arriving at 80 years of age, Cardinal is not allowed to participate in the election of the pope - it belongs to a group of 120 "cardinal electors".
In a speech announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Fedríco Lombardy said that all current Cardinals' meetings, called the Pope, will be held before the new Cardinals are proposed.
Lombardy said, "Pop Francis has decided to inform his decision to organize the Feast's Pope's Day so that it can be easy to make plans for other meetings involving Cardinals from different countries in the world."
Jack Valero of Catholic Voyage said that by February the number of cardinal electors was likely to decline.
He said that pop usually, the number of cardinal electors is less than 120, as Cardinals, and as they wish, the names of Cardinals who are more than 80 years old.
Valero said that the next year's Pope's meeting would be important, because this year, after being elected to France, the first Pope's meeting would be held.
At present, Europe and especially Italy have a precedent for one type.
He said, "It'll be interesting to see if the new pope, the Cardinals, are brainwashing the rest of the world to restore balance.
Forty percent in South America are Roman Catholics, but their number is very low in Cardinals.
Cardinals by France - a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, whose work seeks to improve the ways of the church, will also be the first cardinals to be selected after being formed.
The pope used to make his own decisions about all things.
Valero said, "Now France has chosen these eight cardinals to help themselves."
He said it's possible that France Cardinals would be asked for advice.
But we're not in this situation first - it's completely new.
Valero said that the pope usually appoints bishops of great places as cardinals, but Frances "were going to be absolutely amazing -- so we don't know what name they're going to announce."
Gm has been calling back the pickup tracks in U.S. to fix the seatback
On Friday, according to a report from the U.S. Auto Security Managers, the General Motors Company, has called back about 19,000 tracks in a hand-circuited seat in Shiverde and the G.M.C.S.S.S.S.Pickup Trox.
The front seats in some trucks may be a small part of the system.
As a result, the United Nations has failed to meet the safety standards for Sitback.
According to a information posted on the National Police Department's website, "If the vehicle is hit from the rear, it is likely that the headrest, the driver, could not be properly protected, which would increase the risk of injury."
Callback models were created between 1 August and 10 September.
It began sending to the GM truck in June and, in 2009, the top of the U.S. Automacker post update, represents the most important Vohan launch.
G.M. told the trok masters about the charge in October.
The N.S.M. 16-day government ban, which forced the increase in auto sales in October, could not be considered by the owner of the notification letter.
G.M. told Friday that Silverdo and Sierra Truck, which had been redesigned for the 2014 model year, had 20 percent increase in sales in the first 10 months of the year.
In October, G.M. sold 42,660 Sylvardo and 16,503 Sira pickup tracks.
Friday afternoon in New York Stock Exchange was 1.4 percent off in the G.M. series.
The Discouragement of Obama’s Thoughts
I gave Obama twice as much as I expected.
They say Obama's great efforts have been forced by the anti-GDP policy.
The policy of resistance Obamacier's website can't cure the problems of drone attacks
Obama’s 2008 Campen Memorial reminds us of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris Harvard Medical School is a second-year graduate.
I'm reading a lot of sad books today.
It's a book that I think this second year will boost my enthusiasm and hope in me during medical school.
Its name is "the courage to live", and it is a commemoration of the 2008 election campaign by Barak Obama.
When I wake up at night from my sicknesses and go to bed, this book takes me to a time where politics has driven millions of people, and the talk can stop your breath.
The election proved to be mutual, and news speakers had paused to show the historical significance of the time.
The tears of joy were in the eyes of my companions; and my parents kept the letter of every one that was received.
A group of young people were going to the White House, and the whole country was ready to change.
In 2008, they had 82 percent of their license ratings as President of Obama.
Then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a terrible truth, like returning from the world of dreams.
It is hard to remember those days of hope: they seem to be a distant memory, a painful memory of lost occasions.
I actually changed the first time I went to bed.
Just say, none of this could have imagined.
I thank Obama for his many resources, from the Afordable Cairo Act to the back of our army from Iraq, "Don't ask" to end up killing Osama Bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that the principle of anti-participation has prevented many efforts to move forward in our country: including public access to non-violence, public access to health services, the closure of barriers to Guatemala Bay, as well as other elements.
But the many times I've been taking Obama's administration side by side with my workmates and colleagues, I've got the answer that I can give them.
I've reached the point of political disappointment.
The opposition of the Republican policy is not the response of foreign leaders, nor is the response of drone attacks on children in foreign countries.
This national security agency cannot answer the data about the personal life of US citizens nor can it answer the business of people who expose the wrong actions of the government.
It cannot explain why U.S. citizen Unver El interviewes are killed without a trip, nor does President Campen have a lower public policy and normal limits.
It cannot answer the conclusions of the report, which says that the White House's efforts to silence the media have been the most aggressive since the Nicen administration.
And most recently, it cannot prevent the failure to design a simple website even after three years of being signed in the law of Afordable Cairo Act.
I don't know if I expected it.
If, in 18 years of age, I should have assumed that the government system could break the political campaign that led it forward.
It is clear that the excluded office is not a prelude to the opposition political parties and events such as the Newtown Homicide, will provide the size of our public debate.
However, the examples I have given above appear to be most of the ones chosen by the administration.
This thing bothers you the most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was curious about his hope.
Mit Romani presented a liberating and an indefinite option that did not seem to determine their motives or their position.
I thought that there would be another work for Obama, which would be free from the pressures of the future, and that he would fulfill the hopes that we were hearing from a long time ago.
However, while Obama's permit rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return from the book in 2008.
When I see him, I remember their promises.
This week, he was reading a portion of the book, which described the way in which Clinton was damaged by Obama in Pennsylvania's Prime Minister.
In a post-martm campaign meeting, he told his subordinate workers that they needed to return to the panel, and that they needed to remain faithful to their goals.
He said, "I want my mojo back."
We must remember who we are.'
I can't agree with you any more than five years later.
The thoughts expressed in this comment are of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claimed that P.M. Tony Abbott's fight about the planet's vacation plan is good.
Arabmit M.P. Clive Pamer said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott's fight about the Patriotic Holiday Plan is good because their daughters can get pregnant and can benefit from it.
Majors of the Crime Area, while 6 million dollars are in charge of Bill's payment, have claimed to be in dispute, while they have tried to answer questions about the conflict.
The Pammer United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which can be important in determining the reduction of carbon and fossil fuels.
But Mr. Pammer has claimed that only the good fight between ministers can be, and said that the girls of Mr. Abbott can benefit personally from the nests.
Mr. Pammer said, "They may have a major good fight in the matter of parental leave, because if they have any daughter, they will have a clear need to get their leave or not."
Two months after the election, the election foundation officially announced to Mr. Pamer the victory of the Sunshine Cost Seat of Fairfax, 53 opinions.
Mr. Pammer asked the process to move ahead with speed and to save the number of choices.
The daughters of Tony Aut Frances and Bridget.
Should the outcome of the choice be two months after we have been judged?
They said, "We must have a better system."
Why can't we have a system in which we fill our computer output, immediately vote and have results at 6:30 p.m.
Mr. Pammer also highlighted the use of pencils to mark the prints.
For if a man does not like him, can he take away his vessel?
The use of pencils in today's world seems completely pointless.
The selection foundation, is studying options for electronic communications, and has recently issued an integrated communication letter with New Zealand.
59-year-old Mr. Pamer said that his nephews included an international air permit for Sunshine Coast, and they would take their new work "very seriously".
Public status is for public service.
They said, "We are in the process of declaring the message of history so that we can serve the people at this important time.
Which caused contentions to arise out of the multitude.
Referring to the meeting held on this occasion, the Association president Ramesh Singh Nheji voiced a strong appeal for a corrupt law system in the country.
He said, "The rebels and their families are more and more intimidating than they are."
They have no fear of the police and the administrative system.
He recently mentioned such events in different locations, saying that when the president is not safe, the security of the general can be easily calculated.
RBS delayed two forextended trades
The Royal Bank of Scotland has slowed down two traders in its foreign currency exchange department, which received this information from two scientists from the case, another sign that the global speed of testing is moving ahead of the global speed of testing that is being carried out by researchers at the market.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS Barclays, Dush Banks and RBS, have confirmed that the world's largest financial market in which $5.3 trillion is donated every day, is being co-operated with investors.
These two traders will be the first employees of RBS, who have been suspended by a review of the situation that appears to be the resurgence of the Libor Interbank Haerfer Command.
Bank has refused to comment on Nialmbun and has confirmed that the bank has received a request for information from the policymakers this month.
Two weeks ago, Bank said, "In this case, we're running our tests, and we're fully collaborating with FCA and other investors."
Last month, experts from the case said that RBS sent the former trader and received e-mails and urgent messages to the UK Legal, Financial Behavioral License.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010, and is believed to have been released from this current position by the European leader of Forex Spot Trading in J.P.Morgan.
In the city, Rohan Rammedani, the European Spot Trading leader, was on vacation last week, while the former highest Corenzi Trader in Barclay and UBS was suspended by the Standard Card this week.
None of these traders have been charged with misconduct.
From the case, scientists have reported that M.E.'s rapid message group includes bankers of Barclage and Sitiggrup.
UBS said that, after being told by Swiss Williams that he is investigating foreign currency in many Swiss banks, he has been working against some of his employees this week.
At the global level, at least six licenses - European Foundation, Finnish, Switzerland's rival license Viko, FCA, Justice Department in the United States, and Hong Kong moral licenses - are testing allegations of being misappropriated in order to market money.
The case has been reported by known people that HSBC, Citigrup, J.P.Morgan, and Credit Switzerland have also had an internal test, or requested information from investors.
Banks are testing for a series of years of fast messages and e-mails in search of a bad deal.
The report on the exams has given rise to confusion in trades in areas that have been among the most profitable in the trading unit of banks in the last few years, but they have to face this year's challenge, because of a low-down in Corenzy.
Some bankers tried to suppress the case by saying that it is impossible to transfer too large and too much liquid foreign currency to the exchange market, but top traders say it doesn't have to be true.
Supreme Trader said that foreign currency sales in spite of too large a volume of cross-sectional trading platforms mean that "you can start to influence the market on a little bit of ticket value by selling and using your own platform by banks."
The news came the same day that Credit Swiss announced to Trader his Exchequer Traded funds from the desk in London this week, which lost nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank has immediately announced consistent authorisations and is cooperating with its policymakers.
Credit Switzerland said, "We believe that the trader has worked alone and has been controlled."

The Supreme Court supported Obama’s health service law
As a major victory for Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today declared the Health Service Law on behalf of Barak Obama.
In 5-4 opinions, the judges decided on the basis of the separate order of the Health Security and the National Care Act - the internal citizens' need to buy or punish health diseases before 2014 - that it was inherently legislator in the power to advertise the government.
Chief Justice John Robert supported four other members of the Court of Justice, while the other judges, Scalia, Toss, Elito and Kennedy, were inconvenient.
The court has also supported the remaining paragraphs of this law by the 2700 pages, and said that the condition of the health service law to increase the eligibility of the State Medieced or that they will give testimony to all the combined medical money, is not partially ill.
It was brought by the Supreme Association of 26 states and national free trade to prevent this law.
During the early 2012 session, the law was opposed by all the major Republican Presidents, including the project-designated Met Romania.

Believe in the first freely elected president in Egypt
Muhammad Morsi has sworn to his position, but his day of victory in Egypt may have ended the political struggle.
Islamist Muhammad Morsi promised "New Egypt" when he promised to take office as the first independent president of the country to replace Hosni Mubarak 16 months earlier.
At its official establishment, under the Supreme Constitutional Court, the first Islamic president of the Moorish Arab world, has become the fifth national president of Egypt, and nearly 60 years ago, after the removal of the regime.
And they took an oath of him, and made an oath in the ears of the 18 judges that were bound at the river of the river, which was before Egypt, as it was in the days of old.
Morsi said during an official celebration on national television: "We are looking forward to a better future, new Egypt and other republics."
A terrorist group of Muslims Bradredwood, who has been running for 84 years since its establishment as a non-lawful organization, and who is on the mark of previous governments, a 60-year-old engineer in the U.S. party, Morsi said: "Today, the people of Egypt have laid the foundation for a new life - complete freedom, true democracy and stability."
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen protected the building and, according to local time, came to Morsi's small car cafe shortly after 11 a.m.
Only a few hundred supporters have been gathered outside the court to congratulate the president's smokeout of the President since the time of March, even for a short time, to allow his motor to leave the busy road, which connects the city centre to its southern sub-city.
In the personal dignity of Morsi, who was ridiculed as a "under-tair" of Bradrehud and whose speech on Friday was greatly increased and presented them not only as an Islamist but as a hopeful one of all who wanted to carry out the task of the 2011 Revolution against the Tranish March.
Morsi, dressed in a blue business suit and a red tie, took the stand against judges sitting in the wooden panelroom, saying, "Today Egypt is a citizen, national, moral and modern nation."
After him went to the University of Morsi Cairo, where they were to give their opening talk.
The military band played national smoke and received their official approval, while they were standing in the corner of the alert.
Military governor Field Marshall Husan Tantavi was also present.
On their arrival, hundreds of people in the conference room in the main university welcomed the call "Sena and People Are One Hand".
Founded in 1908 as the foundation of independent education, Cairo University later became the foundation of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath in Tahrir Square, which is the origin of the revolution, which ended the Tanasha regime of Mbarak last year, and sworn to take back the forces who were removed from their position by the military coup last year.
However, by agreeing to take official oath before the court rather than formally accepting the consent of the defendant, they succumbed to the will of the army, which indicates that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic popular coins.

Welcome to the Cabinette meeting.
At the end of the meeting, the lion praised the speech by the chief minister for the response to the attack on Narendra Modi in the Sintan camp.
He also said about his speech that they have no other feelings.
They want the party to be strong.
Let's face new challenges.
On the face of the prime minister, the feeling was that they had taken the lion's speech positively.
It is known that the lion urged the workers in the Sintan camp to honor and protect them from the oppression of the officers.
Although they were also told that they were ready to speak to the ministry.
In this way, after the opinion of the Minten Palace, there is the hope of new thinking in the matter of putting the actors on government positions.
In the camp, district Jadiu President Narainh Singh said that 20 secret committees will soon announce the "mannon" of the workers.
Their signal was that the list was almost ready.
It's news that now the Prime Minister will be measuring the list by his own level.
They'll also check that the list has been made up of vendors-in-chiefs.
If required, changes will be made to the old and the new ones to fit in the list.
The general charge of fugitives-sacrifices is that they were not advised to list the mannonies.
The names of the people who came from the other groups have been included in the list much later, while several important actors have been waiting for the meeting only since the days of the party.
Some people are born with Silver Spoon, and some by their efforts make life a model, and people are driven by it.
There is also a name for self - patience in such individuals.
A small village in Gujarat was born on December 28, 1932, the third son of Hirrachand Goverdendas Imbani, a teacher at a school in the village of Storovad.
The patience of the five brothers was the third.
The five children of the family include Romance, Netter Red, Patience, and Two Sisters Trillochana and Societies.
Because of economic hardship, endurance had to be left behind after high school.
Patience had begun to help the family financially in childhood.
At the time, they were setting up a store near the valley, limited to the number of visitors coming here.
Talking about the first job of patience, they arrived in Eden, Yemen, from a ship named Kabota at the age of 17.
There their older brother Rumnikal kept all the rules for them, so they were not in any trouble to find a job abroad.
But there was something else going on in the mind of patience.
So in 1954 they returned to the estate.
In 1955, 500 U.S. dollars went to Mumbai in order to get to Mumbai.
And their practical journey started from here.
The patience of Imbani increased so much that he never looked back again.
Their name was not a nation, but a people for his name.
The patience of Imbani was released from the world on July 6, 2002.
At the time, they owned 62000 million dollars.
Currently, their sons, Makoshi, and Unbelly, are in charge of their rule.
Like Father today, the names of these two brothers are numbered in international business.
Who Today Do Not Know the Immortal Family?
Patience, Kokilaben, two sons, Macash and Anil Imbani, and their wives, Naita Imbani and Tina Imbani.

Khan told the government responsible for this that they have been removed from political security for political reasons.
It has been noted that, since the shopping year, slaves of the PDP, who won the election in 2002, were included in their ministry, while serving as the prime minister of Haman Khan Mahmud.
Slave Hanson Khan said I've had security since 1996.
I live in the caves of terrors.
A security hand of CRPF at my house was in charge of all the inspectors.
There are also guards with me, but on Tuesday all my security was suddenly taken back.

According to this report, the U.S. government has spent $8.5 million over the past four years in order to measure the size of the panel.
In contrast to Modi's claims, no announcement was issued by the government over the Panel during the period between 1999 and 2004.
On Thursday, Modi, holding the image 'Stau of Unity' of 182 meters high of the main panel in Gujarat, said, 'before that there was no announcement on the occasion of the major panel's authorities.
While the DVD's record indicates that the EU has spent EUR 30 million in 2009-10, EUR 4.10 million in 2010-11, EUR 2.7 million in 2011-12, and EUR 1.4 million in 2012-13.
When central information was asked about Modi's claims by Minister Manich Tivari, he said that Bzepi's PM candidates do not speak on the basis of the facts.
In 2008, UPR did not receive any advertisements on the panel.
Tivari said it was because of the financial crisis that year.
Although the money spent on the commercials of the chief panel is far less than the money spent on members of the Nehru-Gandhi family every year.
DVP was spent on print advertisements for the magnitude and magnitude of the magnitude and magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude and magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude and magnitude of the magnitude of the DVP, for the prior PM political foundation 21 million, and for the Indira dam 14.5 million and the weight of red nehru 9.38 million.
When asked about this distance from the Manich Tivari, they said, 'It should not be seen in terms of advertising costs.
Because the price of advertising depends on a number of things, including the size of the advertising or the rate of advertising for that year, etc.
The real thing is that it shows our dedication, which those who oppose have been trying to maintain the legacy of a great leader without knowing it.
This day shall they meet the families of the men that were slain in the field, on the last sabbath day.

Forwarding dust, rivers, and forests to provide free medical services
Dr. Georges Welle is serving as a free - of - charge health service in rural Cameroon
Wells and their groups see hundreds of diseases every week
There are not many doctors in West African countries; only 5,000 people have one doctor.
Put your vote here or use your cell phone
Dr. Georges Well in 2013 is one of the top 10 leaders of C.N.
You can vote for them or for someone in the top 10 to make the N.N.N. of the year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Well had seen his sick father come to mind and faint, going to the hospital, who were not adequately equipped to help them.
James Welle, in 1981, was injured in a car accident near Cameroon’s capital Yonda.
At first, their hands were only broken, but an infection increased that spread to their brains, and he created blood vessels that affected their rest of their lives.
Georges Well says, "There was no neurosurgery in Cameroon."
If we had the money, we'd take our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Welle took her father and was running a lot of clinics and hospitals and getting whatever treatment they could get.
Well said, "It's not easy."
You leave home at 5 a.m., hoping you'll be the first person to reach the hospital, but that's not the case.
There's a lot of diseases there.
Some can join in the face of death to wait.
Not many changes have occurred since the death of Well's father in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameroon has only one physician for every 5,000 people.
If you compare, there is a physician for every 413 in the United States.
And if there be any physician there, and if there be not many of the inhabitants of Cameroon, he cannot pay the price thereof.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poor line, and about two thirds of the public sector is in health care.
Well says, "Their only problem is poverty."
And because they are poor, they cannot make their lives glad.
And it came to pass, when he saw the plague of his father, and the plague of his inhabitants, that he took counsel to do with them.
Dr. Georges and his volunteer team have cured 700 free blood cells last year.
They became doctors themselves, and began to work as a student surgeon in the central hospital of Yonde.
And they started a non-profit organisation, Escowim, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical services.
Since 2008, he and the group of his volunteers have helped some 32,000 people.
They and almost 30 people sit in vans every Friday, take care of the victims, and go to rural areas where people need treatment.
Sometimes they don't even have the kind.
They have more than once pressed the ship on the river and on the land.
But when they arrive, they are actually given the greatest privilege: the best home to be offered by the poets, the singer, the dancer, and the community.
In these villages, free medical services are actually the cause of hell, and wells - their great muscan and endless energy - are happily involved.
The next morning, their group starts meeting hundreds of patients.
Well said, "We're meeting 500 people on each trip."
They come from the village about 60 miles [60 km] away, and they come on foot.
All these weeks provide clinical services of a variety of types.
Many people are treated with malaria, paralysis, vomiting, diabetes, periwinal and John’s disease.
Others may have received a certificate of Bishkek, Qishma, or a free birth certificate -- the need for this document is in school, but many poor families cannot afford it.
The group simply checks with local reference to the evening.
The operation usually takes place at the school's house, the Town Hall or the house; after the process, the disease goes to the recovery site, and makes room for the next person.
The group's generator publishes in the operating room and sanitizing devices, and wakes up in the morning and morning, and their volunteer Sundays.
This is a slow pace, but musicians in the village usually help to encourage the group.
He said, "They keep us up all night and keep us busy."
Their people return to the city on the Sabbath day. They are weary, but they are proud for their work.
This group -- including Cameroon's medical and foreign medical students -- has been able to cure 700 non-free nurses last year, and they know that their help can change the world of those they help.
One person said that because of being treated with free Hernia she will be able to go back to work.
He said, ‘This is what will change the future of me and my family.’
In addition to running clinical for weeks and working as a surgical surgeon in the hospital, they also work in private medical clinics around the yonda at night.
They said it's their other job that provides 60% of their non-profits; the rest is paid by private donations.
In Philadelphia, Drexel University's second year medical student and volunteer in the Well Group, Katie O'Malley said, "I don't know when they're asleep."
They're always in the hospital, or they're trying to make money for their organization, so they can keep doing these exercises.
This is a useful opportunity for medical and nursing students who come from United States and Europe to join the Wells campaign, which they can never get in their country.
O'Malley said, "In gynaecology we're helping to get medicine for Dr. Well or to clean blood clots, we're able to gain useful experience in them."
You will never get the chance to do that as a second-year medical student in America.
Voluntary students usually talk to themselves to get to Cameroon, and they often come with donations to donate.
But after the years are come, their habitation shall be called, and the burden of the commandments shall be upon them.
O'Malley says, "There is no doubt that they are heroes."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help Cameroon's people will never end.
For Well, it's almost a burden, not a burden.
To help others to live happily, to fulfill the promise of their Father, these are things that bring them great joy.
Well says, "I'm very happy to do this."
And I think about my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh, reduce their pain.

Manmohan lions are the prime minister and their government, yet they have to answer from Modi.
It is your duty to answer people.
Modi was clearly answering Sibbel, who told the speakers in Delhi that Modi wanted their own control environment where they gave their speech and did not speak to them to avoid questions from the press.

The Minister of State has also admitted that they are also guilty of the presence of the N.S.J.S.J.S. in the case of Mr. Edward Snowden as a rebel demonstration on "initiated pilot" with Barak Obama.
This mystery has caused the U.S. government to take a cultural role in relation to its partner countries.
Mr. Kerry, speaking through the video link at a free government conference in London, said: "There is no question that the president, I, and others in the government were really aware of some things that would happen with the automatic pilot, because to look back, the Second World War, and the difficult years of the century war, and then, certainly in 9/11, it was able to do so.
They have become members of the highest level of the U.S. government, who have admitted that U.S.J.J. has extended their limit, but insisted that no one has been abused.
They said, “This is a matter which has already gone far ahead.”
And the president is determined to try to clarify it for the people and are now thoroughly examining it so that no one will feel abused.
I assure you there's nothing wrong with the innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry stressed that, however, N.S.A. was committed to a good purpose, and its monitoring work has saved many lives.
They said, “We are facing a world in which people are willing to fly.”
In the world, there is a vicious rebellion that is bent on killing people and on attacking governments.
So what is the problem if you are able to stop it before it occurs?
We've actually saved the plane from falling down, destroying buildings, and killing people because we're able to know about others' plans before.
During this time, the president of the Senate of European Affairs said that U.S. Secretary of State will try to help resolve the concerns of the so-called U.S. regimes in Europe, as well as the European countries, in conjunction with the U.S., to understand the need to continue the efforts of corruption-related efforts.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke to members of the European Constitution this week and others, and they are concerned about the threat of participation in terrorist counter-organisations by the National Security Agency.
For the first time in the Democratic Party and the President of the Senate Foreign Relations of European Affairs, Murphy, in witness to Washington, said, "It is really important for the national security good that the European country be with us in relation to our terrorist efforts."
To clarify that we need to work together to fight terrorism, European countries need to continue working together, which should not be affected by their anger about the N.S. program.
News of recording Europe's millions of phone conversations with some co-sponsored countries in the U.S., even though the Agency's president said that these reports are not entirely correct, and the metadata shared with the United Nations shared by the NATO co-sponsored nations show a misunderstanding.
Other manifestations of N.S.A. reports that the German Chancellor Agenla Markel, along with 34 other world leaders, has monitored the cellphones of the world's top leaders.
National Secretary-General James Klaper warned him of the need to defend the event against co-sponsoring countries and said that it is common to do so by both sides.
In the middle of the year, Murphy said his office is organizing a Congress trip that is likely to take place this year, and they hoped that both groups and the two Chambers would join the representative body.
The names of the other participants will be changed in the names of the other participants.
He said the tour is still working on the program.
While Murphy said that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he said that some "unlawful relations" must also be sacrificed.
He said that European leaders should also be honest with their social programs used for years with their people.
Murphy said, "Even though we can investigate our surveillance program in order to protect European people's rights better, they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are gambling."
During this week, Mr. Carey's Middle East and Poland program will resolve the opposition to U.S. surveillance activities from Syria, Egypt and Iran.
New policy has begun to change board in city halls.
Recently, the board of directors of the board of directors of the Congress changed to the tableboard because of the change in the number of members of the board of directors in the city of Santitia in Vierbum Gili.

Fearing the threat of the Basic Congress, people are joining it.

In a folk-tech way, any party has the right to increase its fire but it is reasonable to ask the right not to change the subject of government.
