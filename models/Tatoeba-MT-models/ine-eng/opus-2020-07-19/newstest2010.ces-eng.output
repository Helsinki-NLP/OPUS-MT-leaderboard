Barack Obama gets as fourth American President Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama will fly to Norway's Oslo for 26 hours to take over the Nobel Peace Prize here as the fourth American President in history.
Diploma, medals and check for $1.4 million, among other things, will be achieved through exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House will arrive at the Norwegian metropolis in the morning with Michelle's wife and will have plenty.
First, he is invited to the Nobel Institute, where he first meets with five members of the committee who elected him from 172 people and 33 organisations in October.
The president's couple then has a planned meeting with Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonjo.
In the afternoon, the visit will be followed by a celebration ceremony to which Obama will take a prestigious award.
He gets it as the fourth U.S. president, but only the third one who gets the price directly in the office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will speak of the Afghan War when receiving the award.
The President does not want to avoid this subject because he is aware that the price is being taken over as the president who is currently fighting in two countries.
Military efforts a few days ago have increased by sending another unit to Afghanistan, which will not forget to highlight any of its criticisms.
Obama also receives gold medals, diplomas, and checks on ten million Swedish crowns (as many as 24 million Czech crowns).
You're going to give for charity, but he hasn't decided on a specific charter yet.
The President-in-Office's programme will then launch a banquet, with the exception of the Norwegian King and Queen, as well as the Prime Minister and 250 other guests invited.
From the beginning to the price, both of them were more persistent.
For example, he said he felt he didn't deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it is not just about the price for him, but about everyone who strives for the same values as he does.
Shortly after the announcement, he stated he was "a call for action".
Protection of the nature of the accused of extermination
The Lithuanian police accused the President of the Civil Society of the Protection Society of the Nature of Lithuania of being expelled.
In a number of cases last year, he appealed to some construction management, demanding that the investors pay for his benefit, said Lithuanian police spokesman Alena Romová.
The President of the Lithuanian Nature Protection Society is Lubomir Studnička.
He's now in custody and he's been threatened for up to three years.
Brno's class containers are too low
In Prague, ordinary people can sort their drinks packages, and in the Yugoslav villages, you will meet their class containers at every step of the way.
And in Brno?
There to win a few minutes before you can find a suitable butcher.
I don't want to say that the waste in Brno wouldn't be handled at all.
But it turns out that we're the second largest city in the Republic, the councillors are not interested in this problem.
Brno is not only in the laundry class of waste, but as citizens here we can still throw only paper, glass and plastics into the sorting containers, but above all the number of garbage into such waste.
Have you ever tried in the center, for example, to throw PET sheets into the collecting basket?
It's a real piece of shit, mostly it wants time and nerves.
The only place I've ever met is in Moravian Square across the Potrefene House.
Don't let Mr. Onderk and his colleagues get mad at me, but I don't think that's gonna happen.
Do not mention that there is no honey in other parts of the waste classification.
A number of my friends don't handle waste like that.
It's early.
They've got it far to the ashtray.
I don't admire them.
After the celebration, I offered to throw out a few glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colored ashtrays on Kounnica Street.
Luckily, I ran into the right place on my way to the border.
However, the waste was overrun.
It's still the center of Brno, which probably represents the city most, no?!
But ecology and some aesthetics probably don't care much.
These cities would rather buy a hockey extralige that would make us ashamed of the whole Republic than buy a few containers and offer to classify other raw materials for cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I could have confirmed official statistics after a moment of browsing the Internet.
According to the ECO-COM data, Brno is really the worst in the whole of the South Moravia region.
"Paroubkov" budget took money on pensions and sick
After the left added, despite the opinion of the government to farmers or officials, it must not be in the budget of money on income, sick or construction costs.
But also for government debt interest or international court disputes.
It will create problems for those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists were prosecuting some groups, they assumed that the government would also lend more to sensitive spending, income, or sick government. "It's just a delay in the problems in the future, putting the mines down," Janota says.
So the higher the interest is paid out of the borrowed money, and sometimes it has to come back.
There's no way to choose where to take it.
If it does not reduce the social costs or costs of the state's expense, it must raise taxes.
To all that the left hand gave he, to the burners, to the teachers, to the farmers.
And later on to their children.
About the income or the sick, whose account has gone missing 1.8 billion, people don't have to worry, they'll get it.
However, at the price of paying more – next year it will not be less than 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, you will continue to increase as quickly as possible and with him and the cost of interest.
The State will need money for its payroll and will no longer be able to continuously increase VAT or reduce parenthood, as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
Because of the money transfers in favour of several groups of volunteers, the next year will also be missing five billion to supply roads and railways.
It is mainly about already depleted and arranged sections that are not redesigned and, where appropriate, irrigated.
Mostly serve, which is not free either.
This means delaying or suspending thirty large buildings, also threatening to spend European money, warns the spokespersons of Karel Hanzelk's transport ministry.
ČSSD has proposed that the balance of the money will resolve the shaamounsky – it will fall to the dividend of ČEZ, which is mostly owned and from which the transport fund will fall.
The problem is that the amount of dividends is never certain, and it's no longer a pointless source.
Last year, from the Czech Republic to the 18 billion budget.
Every year, the dividend is paid for the disposal of environmental damage, supplemented by a pension account or served as a reserve for a future pension reform.
In addition, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the actual budget deficit by 5.7% of GDP.
But that doesn't stop the carnival movement.
Nearly three billion were spent in the budget for the various compensation of the victims of communism and criminal acts or for the costs of judicial disputes, even for construction disputes.
If you don't have the money, it's not sure.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we'll have to pay it anyway, says Janota.
The Minister will then have to save money inside the resort or, in the worst case, reach the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing from the two billion-dollar state treasure project already under way, which is intended to allow online monitoring of what individual agencies are losing.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister didn't find money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, the sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will manage two operating systems
The Americans to the future are counting with the mobile phone on which the user will press a single button to switch between different operating systems.
The revealed plans sound like a promise.
Just press one key and from Windows Mobile you will be transferred to Android in a few seconds.
This is precisely the option of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to run two user profiles at once.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into household and work.
Both will work in one and at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware in the computer world magazine interview.
He was presented in November last year and was first presented a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully introduced a smartphone test model to journalists with two operating systems.
It was a Nokia N800 with RAM memory of 128 MB size, on which the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems were running at the same time.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in the full stream.
VMware now cooperates with European and American operators to test the virtualization of smartphones and the devices should be delivered to customers during 2012.
Lack of snow on the mountains affects hotel people
Well, they don't just worry about the crocodiles.
Missing snow also reflects people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, free rooms are still available in Krkonosha for all winter periods, including Christmas and Silvestra.
We've got a lot of visitors on our pages.
People are going through offers, finding prices, but so far they're afraid to order.
And if they call us, they'll be wondering if we think this year's Christmas will be on snow or blue," said the information portal operator Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Whoever wants Silvestrov's stay in Špindler's Mlýn exactly as he thinks he should no longer weigh with the order.
Whoever gives preference to the money savings and the quality of the accommodation is with him to the second place, he can still try to wait a few days.
Spindler's hotel owners are currently offering Silvestra more than a week's stay.
I think they'll try to marry them for a while, but then they'll let and go for a short time.
And then the free rooms will die quickly," Jandura guessed.
The free bed in all winter terms is still offered by the Ingtours travel office.
Now we're most interested in the Christmas week that hasn't been sold yet.
That's how half of the place in our offer remains free.
That is why we have already found some cheaper holiday stays for the last time," Ingtours Director Petr Schiefert said.
Silvestra in Krkonosha can offer the top travel office even more, but free places are less.
It's good for the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter terms are sold on average.
This year’s interest in winter stays has a negative impact on the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for him to attack.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If they're snowed during the week, they're selling Christmas," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, something better than February can be accommodated by rooms at Horizont in Peci under Snow.
We're about five percent better on that.
On Silvestra and Christmas we have the last few places.
It is of great interest to Polish holidays in January and is well sold in February," said the director of the best Beijing hotel Karel Rada.
Of the 80 percent have Silvestrov residences occupied and the hotel Omnia at the central parking lot in Janský Lázni.
On the contrary, at Christmas, there are still half of the beds available in the most recent Janskolasen hotel.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by the ice, which is now about 60 percent.
It's a little weaker in February, but as soon as the snow comes up, the interest in staying in the Giant Mountains will certainly rise, the hotel manager of Omnia Erik Sporysch said.
However, on a larger snowflake, the crocodile hotel has to let go of the taste.
It's supposed to cool off on Thursday if there's any hits, they should be snowing on the mountains.
But then he's going to be warmed up again, he informed Jiří Jacobský from the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute's headquarters.
USA: Repeating is a mother of wisdom
He is also comical, with what school effort Barack Obama, president of the most clever story, repeats in the Afghan question of his predecessor's strategy, which he himself considered to be the stupidest.
Finally, when he drowned his eagerly anticipated Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he had taken it through a copy of Bush's Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only in the text itself, he repeatedly uses the word "as in Iraq", but he does not even dare to use the name Bush's January 2007 declaration as the name of his own declaration: "New road forward".
However, three years ago he himself criticised Bush's idea of sending fresh military forces to Iraq as "unresponsible and in its consequences of disastrous decisions".
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy based on the recommendations of full-fledged leaders was the only possible and most successful way to avoid talking today about Iraq in the reporting reports.
Bush did not improve his reputation, but objectively left his successor much more grateful for the background than it could have been expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
He was again asked to increase the military contingent by full commanders, in particular the chief head of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticised the heavy shooter in the White House despite his subordinary habit.
He asked 40 thousand men to break the situation for the better.
The president weighed three months, but he didn't get any better, and at least he slammed the general by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he has been able to demand the commitment of the next 5,000, even though he originally counted at least 10.
The most problematic on the whole Obama strategy seems to be his intention to start downloading troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and end this process in three years. The entire Obama doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that half an increase will produce the same fruit as the one in Iraq.
Despite the recent Brotherhood Wars, the Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders honor the agreement.
The Afghan situation is marked by a different sign - no one can be relied on and no agreements are complied with.
Under these conditions, Afghan security forces are badly prepared to change the gentleman every day according to how they fit.
The political institutions, although formally founded, will remain only a settlement that will continue to be a patriarchal tribal relationship.
The balancing of the interests of various ethnic groups is unusually complex in view of the lack of transparency of the circumstances that complicate even more Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Nor the construction of "a state of action", which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, does not seem to be too realistic.
Obama's strategy's time horizon is invading its volunteerism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the brink of an explosion.
Believe that soldiers sending to a war cry for the purpose of "fast return home" causes a miracle here, can only the soul truly romantic, reality unattainable.
From a political point of view, the date of the downfall of the army is completely irresponsible, as the Taliban will take this as an indirect recognition of the US defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that the Europeans' willingness to participate in war operations in Afghanistan is headed for a decline.
European politicians do not have and do not want to explain to their fans how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Indukush area.
Another factor that is capable of radically affecting the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on Iran do not work, the United States will face a pressing issue, as if trying to solve the military problem.
The answer will be to her at a time when, according to Obama, America will move to a victory landing from Afghanistan.
Any such solution, however, will also mean a dramatic turnout in the Afghan situation.
The only obstacle to Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years remaining in the presidential elections, and therefore there is still enough time to come up with another strategy, if it turns out to be a total failure.
Bank managers Goldman Sachs no longer get cash rewards
The senior executives of the American Bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash in this year's salary.
It announced the company that reacts to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 front managers will get money instead of shares that will be possible to sell within five years.
In addition, shares may be taken by managers in case they are over-risked.
Goldman Sachs thus, according to the Reuters agency, makes efforts to connect the rewards on Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to be issued, the former investment banker JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in detail, he added.
Bank Goldman Sachs became a target of criticism after he paid nearly $17 billion (about CZK 300 billion) in the first three quarters of the year.
The total amount of remuneration in the company for this year, according to the Reuters agency, is likely to exceed $20 billion in spite of the measures announced today.
High wages in the banking sector have become a hot political issue in a number of countries as a result of the financial crisis.
Britain announced on Wednesday that the bankers' bonuses of more than 25,000 pounds (about 712,000 CZK) intend to impose a one-time tax of 50 per cent.
Similar steps are being made by France.
This year women won the Nobel Prize in all except physics
The record of five women in Stockholm today took over from the hand of Swedish King Carl XVI. Gustafa this year's Nobel Prize in professional categories and literature.
There were also four scholars among them a German writer of Romanian origin Hert Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded to two American biologists Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their countryman Jack Szostok, for research in the field of chromosomes.
Israel received the price for chemistry from Ada Jonath along with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of fisheries.
The final award was Nobel's prize for the economy won by American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson for economic management analysis.
The only professional category that went without a holder this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao took this prize for research in optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyl for the invention of a CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical remote views.
Each graded took over the diploma, the Nobel medal and the award certificate.
It reaches ten million Swedish crowns in each category (approximately 25 million CZK).
If it is marked in more than one of them, the reward is shared.
Traditionally the most unexpected Nobel Peace Prize has been received by Norwegian President Barack Obama this afternoon.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his appreciation, for it is only at the beginning of his career that he stands in the forefront of the country, leading two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defending his policy, he added that wars are in a certain situation necessary for the elimination of peace, even though the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering the demise. Klaus invited him to the Garden.
President Václav Klaus will adopt, on Friday morning, the finance minister of Eduardo Janota, who considers the government's collapse, because he disagrees with the state budget for the next year, as the Ambassador of September approved it Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps Janot's break-in in the cabinet will be the subject of their Friday meetings.
The budget also criticises Klaus.
According to him, there is too much deficit, which further exacerbates the public finances crisis.
The meeting was briefed by the president's spokesman, Radim Ohvat.
Janota wants to deal with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the Budget Act, which will now get Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic should be in charge of 163 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, however, the House approved the left-hand proposals for money transfers and raised the money for the payments of civil servants, for the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has put forward proposals for social democracy by concealing the budget deficit.
Between the left-hand side of one and the government, Klaus and the right to the other side, there was an acute intra-political dispute, which started to raise a question about the further operation of Fischer's office, whose formation in the spring of the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party agreed.
Critics claim that the budget, as it was adopted by the House, essentially eliminates the package of measures that Fischer's government has taken in the autumn and is expected to stop the state's debt.
Klaus, who can, but also does not have to sign the state budget law, said on this morning's discussion with the entrepreneur that politicians have been neglecting "a serious problem", which is "an unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
He doesn't think he's got a good solution today.
Improving could only bring a strong government that could also build on a broader political party consensus, my president.
The president of the ODS Mirek Topolánek stated that the budget is scary and the government should consider the next existence.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr said that the concept of an official office with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the green ones is clearly no longer working.
Prime Minister Fischer said similar words for "strong years".
Head of ČSSD Jiří Paroubek responded to Topońka's words that a terrible budget was a budget that was prepared by the former government of Topońkov for this year and which exceeds 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, ČSSD already marked the approval of the state budget for the following year for success.
The people were also at peace.
Mandelu played Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's newspaper
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: Unbeatable will tell the world a lot about the country, about its struggles and victories despite some critics that the main roles are made by American actors.
The story will tell about sport, racial conditions and Nelson Mandel.
An unarmed fighter against the racist regime of apartheid in the South African Republic and its first black President Nelson Mandel in his life story is an Oscar American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that ninety-nine-year-old Mandela asked him if he could make it in Eastwood's movie.
Another important role in it is Matt Damon.
I told him, 'If I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
For example, a 70-year-old actor who won the role of the Eastwood drama from the millions of dollars of baby boxing has already produced a leading movement for the abolition of slavery, from which he eventually became a slave, a fictional president of the United States, and even a god in the Divine Evan, but only a few people who still live and are as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was 27 years in prison for his active work to end the apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released for freedom in 1990 and then for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 the Nobel Prize for Peace was awarded.
Invictus is a Latin word for unbeatable and is the name of English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The picture is a true story of Nelson Mandela joining forces with the captain of the South African football team Francois Pinaar to help unite the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation remains after the apartheid still racially and economically divided.
He believes that he can connect his people through sports, so he decides to unite the players of the race that belong to the world as a whole between the outsides.
The South African team will finally reach the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandel's story on canvas.
I had no other goal than to play this role so that I could get as close to it as possible, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to talk like him.
Herec said that if he and the world politics were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, dinner with him, be in the background before his speech.
The most important thing was that Mandel wanted to shake his hand.
I found out that when I print your hand, I take over your energy, it transmits, and I felt like I knew how you felt, said.
It's important for me to try to be with another person.
Matt Damon works in the film Françoise Pienaara, a captain of the national football team, where white players were involved.
He said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard world of the race.
A great surprise for him was when he first met with Pinaar in his home.
I remember calling my home bell, he opened up to me, and the first thing I said to François Pinaar in my life was, "I look a lot bigger in the movie."
Despite the obvious differences in the characters of the actors compared to their actual submissions led by director Eastwood, Invictus: Unbeatable positive review and is also about the ambitions of Oscar.
The film critic of Daily Variety Todd McCarthy cut his evaluation into words: "It was a very good story, a very well done movie."
In film reviews on the rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus received 76% positive reviews.
The secret of the lightning over Norway is solved: Russians tested the rocket
Over Norway, it was possible to observe the special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Defence Ministry only admitted yesterday that it was not far from the Norwegian border that it tested the intercontinental ballistic missile.
But the start was again unsuccessful and shot marked as the type "Bulva", which was supposed to be originally the crown of the Russian army, slowly becoming the black sea of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence in the missile tests did not have a corresponding effect on the success of the pilot years.
Most of the storm didn't come up or get hurt in the air.
In Russian newspapers, "Bulve" is already written as "a rocket that doesn't fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This was a 13th attempt at a normal start.
By the end of the summer, there was a technical damage to the apparatus.
Apparently the engine exploded in a third-degree rocket.
This time "Bulva" started from the atomic furnace Dmitrij Donski, which floated under the white sea.
This type of rocket enables the firing of a vessel that is moving and at the same time down.
That is why it is likely that the mysterious light on Norway caused by an undetermined flying object was indeed corrupted by "Bulva".
The rest of the Norns have never doubted that it's a Russian missile.
The generals are defending themselves this time and they claim that they cannot speak clearly of failure.
The first two degrees of rockets were sustained and the accident reached to the third.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged immediately to the first degree.
Even though no attempt was made without fault, only six out of thirteen the defence ministry has failed.
Nearly 50% of the success of the generals therefore fills with optimism and still claims that "Bulva" will fly once without problems and even take up to ten hyssop nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed a 51-year contract in CSK Moscow
The legendary defender of Vjačeslav Fetisov is again presented in a professional hockey match in 51 years.
The former world champion, the Olympic winner and holder of Stanley Cup will help his team in need of CSKA Moscow and will probably be on the Friday duel of KHL against Petrohrad.
Fetisov, who completed his career in forty years in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuļaš has been injured, we need another protector.
Fetisov regularly trains and agrees to help the team.
We just need to solve some formal concerns, quoted by the agency AP of the Moscow club's guests Sergei Germany.
It's not clear yet whether the famous hockey comeback will only concern one match.
I think that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the spirit of the other players, he told the Germans.
Fetisov thus becomes, according to the AP, the oldest Russian professional hockeyist in the event of a return to ice.
In the NHL, he played the whole season for Hartford's legendary attacker Gordie Howe and joined 15 goals and 26 assistance.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kastonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union he won two Olympic gold, seven titles of the world master, triumphed over Canada Cup and a junior world championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected achievements in NHL, where he took over Stanley Cup twice in Detroit's dress.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the hockey Sino of Fame.
Hyundai told the board.
The management of Hyundai's car with the committees agreed to cancel all overtime.
It was precisely because of the frequent schedules that the committees announced on Monday's emergency.
He confirmed it by speaking cars Hyundai Petr Vaněk.
However, management wants to agree with the committee on another Saturday's shift.
We cannot rely on our production plan, which is essential, so a voluntary average was designed on Saturday, December 19th, by making two changes, Vaněk said.
Server Sedmiška.cz wrote that the company of employees who process the Saturday shift offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
That'll get people back on Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the motivation of employees for the proposed overtime.
Whether they allow themselves to be paid a supplement in advance or they can choose a replacement on December 28th, and thus they fall to extend their Christmas holidays by day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all employees will receive paid travel and lunch on Saturdays.
In view of the fact that overtime was the most urgent and burning point from the point of view of the comments and complaints of the experts, and of the protesting employees who had stopped the production alive last week, the management of the afternoon decided with the immediate effect of cancelling all overtimes on December, Vaněk stated.
The car employees were forced to work twice a week almost every day after the eight-hour shift.
Following the signing of the agreement, the Committee shall withdraw the urgency
Further negotiations between car management and experts are scheduled to take place on Friday morning.
The Head of the Committees, Petr Kucharj, said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the post.
The situation in the car came to an end last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously arrived due to unresolved overtime.
They also protested against the wrong payment conditions and alleged fraud.
The management reiterated that, in the meantime, employees must work to meet the requirements for the delivery of cars.
In their Monday statement, the experts also requested that no sanctions be imposed on employees who interrupted the production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, the Committees require that it reduce overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay $5,000 for it this year.
The Hyundai car now employs 2,000 people.
The company's serial production started last November.
By September, about 80,000 vehicles were produced, and its current production capacity is 200,000 cars per year.
Czech detection: a substance that also carries HIV to 'accursed' viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of improved substances is that it also includes viruses that have already been obtained against immunosuppressive drugs.
This fact in some cases outweighs the fact that the compound on the common variant of the virus does not work as strongly as some already available medicine.
The disease of AIDS cannot be cured so far.
However, patients can significantly prolong the life-long life-long life-long combination of medicines that prevent the reproduction of HIV virus in the body.
However, their use has a number of side effects.
In addition, incomplete suppression of the virus is due to the development of so-called resistant viruses against which medicines are already ineffective.
The work of experts from the three institutions of the Czech Academy of Sciences, the VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that the substances called metallic carbides affect the protein responsible for multiplying the HIV virus.
Metal carbides are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus other than all the medicines used today and may therefore overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come with new ‘improvement’ compounds prepared based on the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to viral protein.
Metal carborates have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-layered cages made of boron atoms, hydrogen and carbon are connected by metal atoms, in this case by cobalt.
Traditional and Persuasive Virus
HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus which is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by the accumulation of HIV, there would be no mature viral particles.
When we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, explains the scientists in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In the work published in the journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are combined with a short organic chain, which is further systematically modified.
Something weaker, but more reliable.
The effect of this series of HIV protease substances was tested in the faeces and also against its persistent (resistant) variants from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metallic carboran on the usual variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinical medicinal products, but does not lose its effect for resistant variants against which medicines are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of effect and also their other characteristics such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical adjustments from metallic carbides make interesting links for further research aimed at the design of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlín Rezáčová, a leading laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The ODS has left to Fischer, the one who defends himself.
Chief of ODS Mirek Topolánek marked an approved budget for next year for "fearsome" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should consider further existence, according to him.
The statement by the ODS was made by the President of the Government for strong years.
She's leaving time for her analysis.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr said that the concept of an official office with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
The President of the Government has to decide, according to the Untimely, whether he intends to take care of a minority in the House, who is fighting a growing deficit, or who is going to be in the service with the parliamentary left.
The approach to ODS and social democracy to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, he pointed out the lack of time.
On Wednesday, November 2010, the 2010 budget was adopted, with leftover proposals for more than 12 billion crowns.
Szymavan has raised money for the salaries of civil servants, for the operation of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government's exception to the proposal's address to social democracy was, however, that the budget deficits were hidden.
The Czech Republic should manage 163 billion kroner.
The ODS left the hall before the vote, expressed the Government's wish that the amended budget was even less bad than the budget commission.
Disillusionment and vanity
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of the disappointment and feeling of emptiness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government is still evaluating the situation.
Sometimes it is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened the departure of the function in the event of the adoption of the amendments, the situation might look different.
According to the Czech TV, Janota ordered Monday after the government to the prime minister.
He indicated, however, that he was considering further interruptions in the function.
That's why he's disappointed in the budget.
If Fischer speaks for another battle with the budget deficit, they do not, according to the Untimely Government, do what the ČSSD nominees have done, which has passed the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will issue a demise if the House adopts other laws of increasing deficits, such as those relating to sickness, income, or the novelty of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers of Nomination of ODS did not proceed
It's the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The nomination ministers of the ODS did not do anything wrong, Topolánek stressed in the US text report.
He recalled that in several ministries, there are people reporting to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
In time, he stressed that if Fischer decides to reinstate himself on the principle of combating the high level of public finances, "it is quite logical and correct that it is mainly about the left-wing majority that is currently in the warehouse".
But then he can't count on the support and tolerance of civil Democrats.
I didn't think about it, and when it's up to date, I'm going to commit myself to it, he told reporters in the House of Defense Minister Martin Barták, who were appointed to the government by the citizens of the Democratic Republic.
Prime Minister Fischer left this afternoon for the European Council to Brussels.
At the request of the Prime Minister of the ODS,
At the same time, he stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday if the Prime Minister did not expressly request the adoption of the budget.
We do not appear to be poor, we are not young children, then we have responded to the question whether the ODS did not challenge the presence of the chairman of Parliament and the Czech Republic in the political debate on the budget.
I didn't realize my voice was missing.
When I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the following months it would go mainly on the Bolshevik and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek responded himself.
According to the new ČD order, less trains will go for almost the same drivers
The Czech route from 13 December will cancel or limit some less expensive speeds and localities, while other connections will boost.
The total volume of transport shall be reduced from the date of entry into force of the new driving order compared with today by two per cent.
Most tariffs including basic and customer fares shall not be changed.
For example, the people of Ostravska get more connections to the main city, and the routes to this track add one set of pendolins.
On the contrary, the accelerator will stop driving to Bratislava.
Less fasts also go on the trail of Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, mainly the direct connections of Prague - Letohrad.
From the regions, the routes are planning the biggest reduction in the traffic in the King's Land, with a total of eight per cent, on the contrary, Prague and the surrounding area can enjoy growth.
There are also two night trains on the Praha - Tábor - České Budějovice route and several fasts on the Praha - Písek - České Budějovice route are limited to a few days a week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovic to Prague, today the Milovichtý has to move to Lysé nad Lab.
It is the 15th link of the Esco urban system, its opening is possible due to the completion of the electricity line from Lysé nad Lab to Milovac.
Remote connections to the main city will end at the Prague Main Station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Schumperka/Jeseník will go at two hours intervals.
From December 13th to Bratislava, passengers are no longer bound.
This year's account for regional railways: 200 million more
It quickly orders and pays for the Ministry of Transport, in total, the so-called demonstrable loss will give the dragons four billion crowns next year, as well as this year. Locals will order countries, in total, will pay for them next year eight billion crowns, which will contribute to the state of non-three billion countries.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
Locals and fasts have the routes of a newly concluded ten-year contract, so far there has always been a contract for one year.
The routes are complimenting the system, and therefore they have apparently not been able to increase the prices of the dry majority of vehicles.
Changes can only be made to day-to-day CZ Net and cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLišky will be new from a long distance, so far the road between any rural cities has been uniform and made 160 crowns.
The Philippine Armed Forces still hold over 50 people, Children were released
Today, gunmen in southern Philippines have taken 75 people, including some of the primary school students and their teachers.
It was introduced by the AFP agency, which initially only informed about 65 people who were abducted.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping occurred in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 armed men are using handcuffs as a living shield when fleeing from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree to issue the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP Police Agency, the kidnapping was initially prosecuted for the violence that requested the settlement of accounts between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao, a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed was declared a state of law.
Among the victims of the massacre of November 23 concerning elections to the Government Office were 30 journalists.
To suspect participation in the massacre, the governor of this Yugoslav province and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the Ampatuan family, were arrested.
On the island of Mindanao, Muslim separatists are also active.
But on Tuesday, they renewed their peace talks with the Philippine government.
The story of JAR concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film, Clint Eastwood Invictus (official name in Czech is Invictus: Unbeatable), which captures part of the life story of former President Nelson Mandela of South Africa.
The role of a world-famous fighter against apartheid was created by Morgan Freeman, who chose Mandela himself for his creation years ago.
The next male role of the legendary South African champion in the back of Francoise Pionaara was replaced by Matt Damon.
By introducing the image into the movies, they stand out from the voices of critics and the public.
Nelson Mandela
The full name of Nelson Rolikhlah Mandela was born on July 18, 1918, in the South African Union.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of thought, then in 1993 along with the De Klerke Nobel Prize for Peace.
He was President of the South African Republic from 1994 to 1999.
high expectations, as it comes to the public at a time when in the South African Republic, however, the preparations for the world football championship are being made, but the media are also exacerbating disturbing reports of growing racial hatred and discrimination by the black-dominated majority.
According to the AP reporting agency, the announcements to the new film in JAR for the time being are positive, even despite numerous exceptions to the storage of the main roles of "proflict" Hollywood stars.
However, Morgan Freeman says he's proud of a new movie.
I've been dreaming of that role for years and I've been getting ready for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela personally many times to, as it is said, drained his energy, led the conversation after the film premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can mention Mandel's personality and message in the film.
It's the story of the South African Republic, but it's about everyone, he added.
As part of the national rug team
A picture based on a book presentation by British writer John Carlin with a freely translated name In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that gave rise to the nation portraits the South African human rights tribunal during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman is therefore trying to stifle two races in the course of the film, and after many years of inter-marriage groups and as in 1995 Nelson Mandela, he is also taking part in an acting role in the South African national rugby dress on the scene of the world Cup, which JAR won at the time.
For the entrance to the lawn in a dress, which is almost understood in the JAR as something sacred, Mandela made a large sheep mostly white audience fourteen years ago and gained recognition of the white population.
The football championship, as if it could reunite people into one nation, introduced the rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in 1995 in the national team.
Whether the hurrying situation in JAR improves, it just turns out.
The white South Africans, however, are skeptical, as an example in a recent LN interview, produced a fan of Christopher Dawson’s backbone, who fled the country to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In Lousca, the transformer burns tens of millions of crowns
In the morning, the company transformer Čeps caught fire in the divorce at the village of Výškov in Lounsk.
In the fire, according to the speakers of rural fires, Lucas Marvan has six units.
The firemen originally wanted to let the transformer burn, but later they reassessed the opinion, and fire extinguishes the mixture of water, foam, and special Hassibles.
That's why it was a technical failure, the internal crack of the transformer.
No one was injured, the accident, according to Paully Mandat’s spokesman, does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at tens of millions of crowns, exactly counting it will work until the fire is over.
The destroyed transformer will have to replace it with a new one, according to the Mandate.
After ten years of action, Čeps had nothing like it, the problems of this type were isolated, complemented.
The supply of electricity was not affected, according to the Czech spokesman for the northern Czech Soni Holinger Hendrichs, by the operation of the households, the authorities or the company of the traffic station fires.
A.s. Čeps operates in the territory of the Czech Republic as an exclusive transmission system operator, electric control 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 divorces with 67 transformers converting electricity from transmission to distribution system and driving routes of 4339 kilometres long.
Janchura gives a criminal notice for a three-heitman talk from ČSSD
The owner of the Student Agency Radim Janchura today gives a criminal notice for the talk on three social-democratic issues.
And it's at Michala Haška from the South Moravian Region, Radko Martínka from the Pardubic Region and the Heitman of the Olomouk Region of Martin Tessarík.
Janchura introduced it in twenty minutes of the Radio Journal.
The complaint relates to the company's efforts to operate regional train transport in some countries.
All regions but finally signed long-term contracts with the Czech Dragons.
All three hetmans are attacking us and talking about choosing roses, and we've only made an offer for what they wanted.
They claim that we are dearer than the Czech Dragons, which is not true, because we know the prices of the Czech Dragons, which were closed last week.
So we don't care until we defend ourselves.
It's for a talk with the Student Agency, said Janchura Radio Journal.
At the same time, he stated that he had evidence from all countries that they did not take their steps in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing to propose to the European Commission.
Mr. Janchury's continued media show, which serves him as an unpaid advertisement of his company and his own.
I am, of course, prepared to raise the good name of my country and of my country and to the same challenge as the others.
I assume that even on this occasion it will be clear that it is Mr Janchura who manipulates the public and uses false and false arguments in the area of regional rail transport, Hasek has introduced.
Jancura announced last week that she was investing a few million crowns in advertising, which would be an unfavourable step for countries.
The radio journal said that after Christmas the campaign would be interrupted and continued after New Year's.
He explained that the campaign would be directed against corruption like that.
The campaign began after the countries agreed to operate regional railway connections with the Czech Dragons and the order of around 150 billion crowns did not express trends.
According to Janchura, the proceedings are similar and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
As a result of the criticism of rail transport in the countries, Janchurov has already been threatening a member of the ČSSD.
The only danger was that if we don't let it go, we can get a bus license.
He was represented as a member of the ČSSD, I know which gentleman he's talking about, I won't say his name, said Janchura Radio Journal today.
Pneumococcal expectations will be free and non-compulsory
Expectation against ice-cold tyres is a common practice.
It's supposed to be the first for families to be free and at the same time unencumbered.
But there are already rumors that it would be more effective to expect.
Preparations for the introduction of free spraying against pneumatic caps.
The medicinal product has already established maximum prices for vaccines which will pay health insurance.
Experts are also clearly in the process of choking.
New Eyebrows
Free vaccines for children in August
Children born last August 2nd and later may be treated free of charge from ice.
The condition is that they haven't received a single dose of choking yet.
Anyone who started treatment last year or earlier has to pay for another treatment.
The first dose of dosing should be given between 3 and 5 months of age.
She voluntarily allowed her children to fight the tires of a quarter of a family last year.
At the time, the parents paid 1,600 crowns for one dose and more.
Four doses are needed when the youngest children are breast-feeding.
Overall experts estimate that health insurance is available at the treatment doses of 300 to 450 thousand crowns a year.
However, they will save the treatment that children would need without a baby.
So far, he has given about 500 grand a year to all the childish expectations.
The banishment was introduced by the so-called Janoto package.
Pneumococcal causes central ear inflammation, but also serious infections including strokes of the brain and blood vessels.
For the pneumococcal infection, we're going to die a year, according to a hospital survey of up to 28 children under 10 years of age.
In addition to the Czech Republic, children were subjected to widespread pneumococcal vaccination in 40 countries.
Is this going to be mandatory?
At the same time, however, opinions appear that this expectation may be mandatory in the future.
From the ice, it's supposed to be covered by insurance and non-compulsory.
For example, the chief of the civil society Nałas Rudolf Kalovský pointed out that it would be better to expect.
His pneumococcal vaccine association has been promoting for a long time.
Experts at the international conference that our association participated were not fully satisfied with our voluntary expectations.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are pleased that at least this has been done.
I think it's the path that we need to go to now, brought in the Kalovski.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcals.
At this point, we are not considering it at all, his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň said.
Voluntary expectations have its advantages, hard doctors
The president of the Expert Society of Practical Child Doctors, Han Cabrnoch, acknowledges that he has a voluntary expectation of his disadvantages.
If all children were treated, it might be considered to reduce the number of overdoses "For the situation where this vaccine is so high, we understand relatively the political decision that the vaccination has been dismissed as voluntary," says Cabrnoch.
Experts expect that it will allow more than 80 percent of fresh parents to be treated against pneumonia from next year.
Pneumococcal pneumococcal pneumococcal pneumococcal pneumatics is also fragile in that it is not a state of health insurance as the first flat pneumatic pneumatic pneumococcal pneumococcal pneumo.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, save for further treatment, explains Cabrnoch.
Doctors will have to buy the drugs themselves.
However, it is related to the concerns of practical child doctors involved in the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original purpose, vaccines should be purchased by insurance companies, and doctors should receive them, just as the state supplies them to others.
However, some Members were afraid that insurance could be "exposed of health insurance money".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the substances and wait for them to be paid.
According to estimates, individual practitioners will invest in vaccines 40,000 a month, which is a significant amount.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnoch.
The son of an American artist 'stealed in the museum'
The son of the renowned American fictional designer Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal images worth $20 million (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Police in Pennsylvania reported that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 images into his vehicle and trailer.
Mr. Frazetta and the other man used to break into the museum in the Poconco Mountains bagr region.
Mr. Frazetta, aged 81, celebrated the creation of Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time it happened, the artist was in Florida, as the press agency Associated Press reported.
The AP quoted an unnamed police officer as saying that Mr Frasetta's younger could have been motivated by long-term family disputes.
In front of the police, Mr. Frazetta issued a younger sworn statement, 52 years old, that he did so to his father's instructions, "to get to the museum in any way possible and move images into ice-creams," as the agency stated.
Mr. Frazetta, the senior, has refused to grant any such permission as the agency has indicated.
Labourers defend the planned increase in taxes
The Ministers defended the increase in the expenditure and the savings reported in the preliminary report on the budget against criticism by the opposition, entrepreneurs and committees.
As Alistair Darling pointed out, the Torys had the opportunity to show that they were serious about delaying the decision to reduce the deficit until after the elections.
And the office got under fire because of the lack of low- and middle-income workers.
According to its proposal, 0.5 % of social security growth and 1 % of the adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Dissolvement of social insurance
The committees protested that low-income workers were punished for a recession they did not commit and warned ahead of "problems".
Social insurance is increasing - growth makes about 3 billion pounds per year - which has led to a community of entrepreneurs who have stated that it is a tax on employment while it should focus on economic recovery.
This increase, which limits these revenues to over 20,000 pounds per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY BODIES PBR
Social insurance increases by another 0,5 % since April 2011
The economic situation is getting worse by 4,75 % this year than expected.
New tax 50% of bankers' bonuses
Growth 1% of company tax for small companies
Reduction of taxes on motor vehicles and wind power plants
Increase in income measurement by 2,5 %
According to the estimate, some revenues of 30000 pounds per year are reduced by 90 pounds and some revenues of 40000 pounds are reduced by 190 pounds, while some revenues of 10000 pounds are increasing by 110 pounds.
Ministers announced that their target of half-deficit reduction by 2013 was "complicated decision-making", but insisted that 60% of the special tax should fall to 5% of those with the highest income.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms argued that the proposed increase in taxes and expenditure limitation would be "a drop in the ocean" compared to what would have to be done.
"It's a big number, which allows us to reduce the half deficit, which is an absolutely basic requirement for the next four years," the BBC reported.
Mr Timms stated that he was convinced that economic growth should come at the end of the year.
But drawing up a forecast for future economic growth - which will have an impact on the volume of the necessary loans and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be a barrier after the official has been forced to review the previous amounts.
In the opinion, the decrease in the economy was 4,75 % this year - far worse than the 3,5 % reduction predicted in April - because the loans were 3 billion pounds higher than previously estimated.
Prolonged opportunity'
The conservatives, who launched a new promotion campaign on Thursday, protecting against the "debt crisis" of laborers, marked the planned loan of 789 billion pounds over the next six years as insurmountable.
Ministers failed to submit a credible plan as to how it could be paid, added, "cynic" postponed this decision until after the elections - which must be held by June 2010.
"They didn't add anything significant to what would be feasible," said the shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had the chance to do it, but they blinded it."
"All important announcements will be made after the elections if we win them "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labourers insist that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future scarcity in contrast with the Tory proposals that would want to reduce the deficit faster and to a greater extent.
But liberal Democrats argue that the money obtained by increasing taxes and cutting costs should be used to support expenditures in the coming year rather than to reduce deficits, and argue that the plans are "based on sand".
The BBC political commentator Nick Robinson stated that the communication was timely - for example, the above inflation is increasing and will result in a failure to pay the dose in the next April - that it could lead to the prosecution of the election campaign's office if the money was hard to get back a year later.
But workers are continuing to provide special assistance if they need it very much and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
Suspected budget'
Although the Ministers did not disclose the details of the expenditure after 2011, the economists stated that it is clear that the reduction of public expenditure would only be due to the beginning of the medium-term constraints.
The recognised Institute of Budgetary Studies has reported that the numbers of offices indicate significant gaps in many areas, potentially in the building include transportation, higher education and defence.
"It's really painful so far," said his director Robert Chote.
"All important statements will come after the elections if we win them," Roger Bootle, an economic adviser to Deloitte's bookstore, added.
"It was a report on the suspect preliminary budget, and markets are implementing it."
The FBI conducts investigations in 'American Prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI investigates five Americans suspected of connecting to extremists in Pakistan.
Men were imprisoned for attacking the house in Sargoda in the province of eastern Punjabi, as the BBC reported the US embassy in Pakistan.
The FBI reported that it was an investigation into whether it was the same men who were declared unrecognizable in the last month in their home country in the United States of Virginia.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stated that it is also about obtaining information about these men.
Three of them are said to be the origin of Pakistan, one of them has Egyptian ancestors, and the other comes from Yemen.
"If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and the circumstances under which they were detained," said Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokesperson Katherine Schweit announced that the agencies were informed about the arrest and were in contact with families of missing students.
"We cooperate with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are really wrong students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington reported that men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
It stated that the house was always in the centre of interest of the local police and that the charges against the men in custody had not yet been brought..
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Hillry Clinton refused to comment on the arrest, told the press agency Reuters, but stated that the United States must "co-operate much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in the decoupling of the infrastructure of terrorism, which continues in the recruitment and training of persons".
The disappearance of these five students from home in northern Virginia was reported by their families at the end of November.
Refusing amnesty for Iranian tyrants.
The situation in respect of human rights in Iran is as bad as in the past 20 years, as the Amnesty International's report on the export of the Amnesty International Group states.
The report describes in detail "the methods of torture" in the regime before and after the controversial presidential elections in June.
One man said he was beat and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected the above criticism of this human rights report.
Officials have identified this criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed after the contested election of President Mahmud Ahmadine, leading to the greatest street demonstration since the Islamic revolution in 1979.
Ten of them were imprisoned, and the plaintiffs sentenced the last five people to death.
The BBC writer in Tehran John Leyne, now located in London, stated that earlier in protests, the senior leader of Ayatollah Ali Chomejní declared the injustice of some forms of torture and prohibited their execution in the Karizak Correctional System.
But since then, almost no criticism of the legal power has been tolerated, as our writer stated.
False confessions'
Amnesty International quoted the report of a 26-year-old student in the field of computer technology by Ibrahim Methari, who stated that he was accused of "working with Facebook network" and of protests against election results.
"Many times they were in my face," he said in a statement.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head, threatened me with correction and humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty reported.
In August, the presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubí was arrested after the elections and sentenced to death in prison and the others were raped.
Iranian senior state officials have denied charges of rape, but they have allowed torture to occur.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who stated that he was kept in a container with 75 others for a period of longer than eight weeks in Kahrizak prison.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and justice had set up committees to investigate election concerns and government reactions, but stated that the mandate and authority of the authorities were unclear and that the findings of the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group stated that at least 90 people were detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
In the city park a ski lift was created
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to change the memory in Bristol in the main race track.
The main race route to the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prices.
At the top of the train station in Brandon Hill Park was a short ski resort 100 metres away from the train station.
A fourth-year-old medical student, John Hickman, said that it was a wonderful view from the top of the ladder, but that it was really exciting.
It was a beautiful view of the bright lights of the city down.
Here were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them real talents," he added.
Prices have been awarded for the best pieces - or maneuvers on the highway.
After Thursday night's competition, the snow was left to scatter.
They're still with us.
Can he be a Muslim Frenchman?
Pluralism and pragmatism in secular state.
At the time when the Swiss voters called for a ban on the construction of minerals and generally spread horrendous reports about the alleged Islamism of Europe, John Bowen, the American Academy, wrote and informed and wondered whether Muslims could be integrated - and whether they were integrated - into one of the most unopened secular societies of the continent.
After reading this book, some readers became admirers of the author of the last piece, "Why the French don't like the hats on their heads" (2006), this elegant and debated study on controversial issues that divide and employ the country for 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr Bowen's last book has a broader and much more ambitious picture.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened on the basis.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutions, which are now taking care of 5 to 6 million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic Spaces".
He's a good listener, he reproduces debates between teachers and students on the issues they're most concerned about.
Should Muslims enter the marriage union in a mosque or in a council (or in both places)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the development and rights of gays?
Can a Muslim marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does Muslims have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system to obtain a mortgage?
These seem to be the world's controversial issues that are being debated and that are part of everyday life rather than the political dramas that employ the media.
The author identifies a new generation of images, teachers and intellectuals, among other commonly known persons, excluding Tarika Ramadan, Araba, Muslim researcher and academics, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up a discussion about how it can be a good Muslim and a good citizen in modern secular society at the same time.
They have no arguments for all their customs.
Conservatives are unreliable of the true idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists with whom Mr Bowen conducted the interview are committed to the domain that it is the anti-Salofi-prisoners of the Sunni Islam purist who are associated in Saudi Arabia – this group is small, but affects European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
It raises the question of how far French politicians (and intellectual elites who are so disillusioned with the secular public) are actually given the idea of pluralism.
It is the view that Muslims have probably less experience in the matter of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to compromise historically with secular republics.
More than the development of pragmatism has found "the removal of scratches".
After reading this book, someone may have a tendency to say, "Yes, but not now."
The World’s Most Enjoyable Views
The Arctic is changing faster than the other environments of the planet.
The limiting ice is the alarming speed, which affects animals and their survival as nowhere else.
The loans of oil, gas and fisheries companies must focus on new natural water sources, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers when they wake up.
In the book "On thin ice" Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, depicts the natural history of the North icon, polar bear.
Well-known for the complicated history and the procedures of the Velvary describes the long tradition of polar explorers who tried to strengthen the white bear.
The admiral Nelson's meeting with a brave 14-year-old swimmer who was fighting only with the shell of a mosquito is really myth, but all the others are true.
Young bears who were swimming behind the bodies of their just killed mothers were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears appeared suddenly in a circus state.
Even today the fences in the zoo typically have a million times smaller area than the area available to adults in the wild. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the lower hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis suffers from the work of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of species.
Although hunting is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where they hunt from helicopters and Indians on skis, and they are all armed by powerful attackers who shoot their prey.
Ironically, it's happening in the water north of these two hunting nations and that ice will finally be the biggest.
In his new book "After Ice", Alun Anderson, former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and unsatisfying responsibility for the Arctic science and a perfunctory summer view of how the future can change it.
Not all scientists have answers.
Neither meteorologists nor oceanographers have an adequate response to the rate of change.
It's for lack of testing.
The research trails of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries first indicated how the ice is moving.
Then the humble for the Cold Wars disappeared and the sinking people were moved.
Satellite research and extensive field probes in floating glaciers are a useful supplement, but many are still being done thanks to the safe individuals who camp in the winter.
Mr Anderson is looking at the extremely fragile world of the Arctic ice floor system, created by the flow of salt water that is dying when it is frozen.
But from the above to the microscopic wonders, all of this is doomed to decay as the summer ice moves, which sometimes takes place between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... it can be us'
6000 members of the seabed laid their hands on the graves in Arlington
Lieutenant De'Angello Robinson, 19 years old, traveled by bus for seven hours to place a simple feast on the tomb of a soldier he never met.
For him and the other seamen who took a trip from Johnson camp in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemeteries in Arlington, to recover the graves, that was the day when they were holding men and women who once wore the same shoes.
In a few months, when we land, we can be, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I'd like someone to do the same for me, to show me respect just as I try to do it.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered this Saturday morning to place the prisoners at the funeral of the veterans in several departments during a Friday act in Arlington.
In 1992 Morril Worcester, the owner of Worcester's funeral company in Harrington, Maine, initiated this tradition when he and several others decided to recover several hundred graves during the Saturday act in Arlington.
Now it is an 18-year-old tradition when Mr. nMorill and his wife, Karen, take this journey every year and stop in different cities along the way to remember members of the army and victims of terrorism.
Worcesters don't look for any profit in it, they owe it to America, which they place in other countries.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 Vences in the Arlington cemetery, the Pentagon area, the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City, and the number 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, Walmart has spent over $150,000 on the purchase and transport of vineyards.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, stated that she had made a trip to Arlington to honor her husband, a retired member of the armed forces.
Because her husband was not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said it was her way back to what the victim was doing.
It's a small way that citizens can support our units, she said.
It's like a family grave visit.
Those who were trapped in the thickets of a warm substance were forced to go through their own graveyards along the surrounding lawns and pahorices.
Volunteers headed for the oldest graves from the first and second world wars and from the Vietnam wars, because these have not been visited as often as the newer graves
The call was positive when the children played and held their hands together when they carried a young boar to our burial stones.
Every roundabout was dark green with a little red ring the top part of the dog.
Nearly 60, where most of the veterans from war in Iraq and Afghanistan were buried, remained silent.
The United Service Organization dedicated 1,000 volunteers to the refreshment of the department, but the cloudy mood of the war just under way filled this area.
Some sincerely cried, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in cold air.
Some read the name out loud in the rocks, while others agreed to look at the small black names, pressed into the wet mud where the burial stones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who had tears from their eyes in front of their son's grave.
She spent eight hours from Zanesfield in Ohio to visit the last resting place of Sergeant David Shane Spicer's training headquarters, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free. ..my son paid for it, rules.
"Even though I've been away for a long time, I want to be the one who will remember him."
US government supplier imprisoned by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government imprisoned an American government supplier who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, as foreign ministry officials indicated on Saturday.
The supplier, which has not yet been identified, worked for the company Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, together with the American section of interest in Havana, sought access to the detainee who was arrested on 5 December.
Certain charges have not been published, but according to Cuban law, Cuban citizens or foreigners may be imprisoned for almost anything that is referred to as "hazardous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical states, pose a risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered to be serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are monitored and harassed by government agents.
Ms. Sánchez repeatedly requested permission to leave the country so that she could take over the prices, but the permission was denied.
The retention of the US supplier may be the result of the growing tension between the communist Castro brother, who is ruling Cuba, and Obama's administration, which was monitored as "maintenance tactics" in improving relations with the island.
As the first reported on the New York Times' arrest on Friday night.
The new American policy stressed that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and creates more room for opposition, the United States will take reciprocal action.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after comets in the country where the average salary of the state employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; these are used mostly by sending text messages, because the 15-minute telephone call would be more than one day’s wages.
Internet use on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and in some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to sign up must announce their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
The detention of the American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind the thresholds for drug trafficking, according to Gloria Berben, the press office of the Section for American Interests in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't provide more information about the prison.
The arrest and detention were clearly immoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open company - let's say free mobile phones - are a criminal offence in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the American Human Rights Programme, who recently published a negative report on Cuba's freedoms, called "New Castro, Tataz Cuba", as an intervention on Raula Castro's installation as the leader of the country and a reward for the famous older brother Fidel.
Vivanco stated that the defendants were often arrested, imprisoned and imprisoned within one day.
He stated that all the solutions would be more political and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, just as these two countries are moving towards a wider dialogue.
Pakistani government officials cover a conspiracy concerning the sending of men to Afghanistan.
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities discovered the alleged leader of the conspiracy concerning the dispatch of five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US troops there, and stated that they hoped that this case could help to unravel a wide network of terrorists who follow the Internet and search for radicalized young men.
The investigators stated that they were searching for the gray-headed personality known as Saifulláh, who invited these men to Pakistan after he first discovered when one of these men released a comment approving territorial attacks has a YouTube video page.
Saifillah took over the leadership of these men as soon as they arrived in Pakistan, and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan in the indigenous tribes of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaeda and its camps for training terrorists.
But the Pakistani reporter who reported on the case stated on Saturday that Saifulláh was unsuccessful in certifying the commanders of al-Qayda and that men were not part of the CIA's attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, several days into the eastern district of Sarghoda, far from the terrible mountains in the northwest, they became a refuge for terrorists.
They were considered a hit unit.
The reason they were expelled was stated by an official who spoke of maintaining anonymity in view of the sensitivity of the case.
The official stated that men were not afraid and were still trying to obtain consent to gain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law.
The case of this five - which remained in Pakistan and was questioned by the FBI - highlights the critical role of the recruits in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, which is much more important, the determination of who is reliable.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US intelligence service has given the highest priority to efforts to place human resources in al-Qaeda.
The organizers of the organization act as a guard, separating those who are not serious enough in their commitment to the holy war and those who might be investigators.
U.S. fake recruits were detailed in al-Qaeda's special examination, analysts reported.
But they were also considered to be extremely interesting in the group because given their potential approach to American goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, the senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, has stated that terrorist groups have also become much more careful in recent years, allowing him to join them because US reporting agencies have gained expertise in their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to penetrate these groups, there is no better way than to act according to their recruitment model, which has already been monitored so much? Mr Kohlmann said.
This model is one of those that is far more web-based.
Tens of thousands protested in Kodana, demanding climate 'action'
Tens of thousands of protestors walked the streets this Saturday and demanded more action regarding climate from negotiators in the city congress centre of Bella.
The protesters have reported the number of statisians participating in this event, but the police insist that the number was close to 25000.
The event was relatively calm and a handful of masked activists placed several small bets near a group of government buildings in the center of the city.
On the day of a small event in the United Nations climate talks sponsored, thousands of activists went through the city and carried transparency with the English inscriptions "This is not a planet B" (i.e. the second century) and one in Spanish who said "The Earth says 'a lot'."
The protest was attended by several celebrities, including Danish models and photographers by Helena Christensen, who stated that she had traveled to her mother’s home in Peru and provided me with information about the state of the country in which the climate changes are taking place.
That is a partial reason why we have decided to join this great movement -- to go through the world and appeal to the world's leading personalities to submit a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, said.
It's not an easy task, but it's necessary to carry it out, you can't keep avoiding it.
The police prevented the protestant from approaching the center of Bell and stated that she was holding 19 people, first of all because either they had wearing masks or they had pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during the demonstration.
According to one unaccompanied viewers who do not want to be identified because they are involved in climate talks, masking activists as athletes and in black clothing have placed a number of orders near the Kodanian main channel, which is located near several ministries.
They were excited at the buildings, he said, they were lighting the lights, but then they followed "some big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march in the afternoon.
But protests probably did not penetrate the knowledge of key officials, such as Su Weie, the main Chinese climate negotiator.
When asked whether the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he answered in English "Currently, that is something that I was not aware of" (in fact it is something I do not know).
Then he went on in Chinese and said, "Because the reality is vast, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed whether the income was painful or helpful depending on everyone’s prospects.
It is visible that the public and various sectors are concentrated and subject to climate change, he said.
In other words, "It can also be said that it is a violation of the conduct or freedom of others.
The test data revealed persistent racial differences
Last week’s federal certificate of acquired knowledge of mathematics was welcomed by a section of the good news about Columbia’s public school.
Although the district is far behind high-performance systems in the country, the certification has shown greater progress among the fourth and eighth grade students in the last two years than in the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest numbers of the National Certificate Centre for Progress in Education is the lasting differences in the knowledge acquired between African Americans and white students, both on the local page and on the national page.
In the last two years, the average score of white pupils in the fourth class of Columbia has increased from 267 to 270 points (from 500 possible), but only three points have increased from 209 to 212.
The difference in knowledge achieved has indeed increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
The progress of African Americans in the eighth grade remains largely balanced, with the exception of a statistically insignificant one point from 245 to 245.
The average score in white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The image in the horizon for six years is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between the white and black fourth grade pupils in 2003 when the first NAEP was carried out in the county was 60 degrees (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved in children from both groups improved during this period, the difference was roughly 58.
In the last week, some district education advocates said that the results celebrated by the mystery of Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fentym (D) were more stimulated in white students where the results were already high.
This would suggest that we have increased the range of support for those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and worrying, said Jeff Smith, executive director D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equality of teaching in the county.
A member of the D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade primary school in EATON, said that she is not jumping up and down for two or three points.
Often criticizing the style of Mrs. Rhee's administration, Mrs. Brown pointed out that the report on the results of the tests means that high school in the city is in a desperate state and requires attention.
It's obvious that you always want to see the flaws and I respect it.
But what's amazing is that we didn't spend almost any time and energy that we needed to devote to our high school.
Mrs. Rhee said that the effort of the county is to continue to look for better ways to address the needs of low-income students.
For example, some teachers are trained in the use of new reading bases, Wilson's reading system, focusing on students of the higher classes of primary schools and high school students who have not been able to master the basics of reading before in their careers, are significantly left behind by their pupils.
Each day's mathematics and the basics of mathematics education in the sixth grade, highlighting the real life games and experiences that came into the county as former director of Clifford Janey, can be added to the threshold of the NAEP progress reported last week.
And I just think that we should continue to work and make the best effort of those students who stay in the classrooms, Mrs. Rhee said.
Others stated that the results of NAEP explained the question whether Mrs Rhee could continue to improve the overall performance of the system and continue to provide additional money and resources for schools with low performance, which is necessary to reduce the difference.
It's certain saved by Mrs. Michelle Rhee's dilemma, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, where he studies the results of tests in urban areas.
The Conventional Correction Procedure is to focus funds and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of the province of Columbia.
In this way, the focus can bring political upheavals that are directed against the important agenda.
However, the exodus is also one of the other city directors who are trying to maintain the average diameter between white and black.
We need to focus on building a system of large schools.
We need to use the relationship of our schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, can rely on their children to provide excellent public education.
Mr. Janey, now the school director in Newark, said in an interview this week that the basic element of reducing the difference between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the county in order to achieve school legitimacy.
You have to get up to 200 days to make changes, said Mr. Janey, who concluded a contract with his teachers' association last year for the school year in 185 days, which is considered a "prime" to seek a greater increase next year.
Make higher education part of the better future
The train bus went to the Gettysburg College with a loud respiration.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, came out and immediately began to rest on white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns..
Graciela's parents were having a hard time graduate from high school in El Salvador.
So far Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never got up on the floor of the college.
Now she and other students in the eighth grade group were studying Gettysburg, where the school cost $38690 a year, their position was more than the fear of visitors of the enthusiasm of potential students.
Yes, that's it! she called Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, really?
The Pennsylvania train was one of seven who visited their class visit and were now fully interested in the future report: The question is not whether you will enter the college.
The question is where.
However, this is a serious problem regarding the high number of children born in the United States of Spanish immigrants who are excluded from high schools or pregnant as an unaccompanied person, but there are statistics of those who receive further education and thus enter the secondary class.
In fact, five of these "big generation" Spanish students from the college - remarkable results have shown that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and residents of Central America, have arrived in the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers point out, because this undermines their point of way ahead of the generation that played a territorial role in the labour force field of the country.
Those who have attained higher education say that they have a natural tendency to attend school and a natural commitment and effort to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and looked for ways to replace the ignorance of American school.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciele and millions of children who would like to graduate from the train - especially if these efforts persist in time.
If we look at the fact that children come from low-income groups whose parents have no experience and ability to help them guide themselves in a system, any simple intervention at each point does not solve it, says Patricia Gándar, a researcher at the University of California in Davis, where she studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing these children with an attractive preschool network in every way they can clean up high school.
The federal program that financed Graciely's ride in the neighborhood is a useful example.
Known as the GEAR UP (appropriate), it provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to launch further preparatory programs that start for students from groups with small incomes in high schools and continue until these students graduate from high school.
Since 1999, this programme has served more than 10 million students, of whom more than % have entered colleges, according to the US Ministry of Education data.
The Irish Ministry of Oil Industry reached agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
In spite of concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has succeeded in adopting significant oil companies to rebuild its non-life infrastructure during the two auctions that took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industry with foreign oil companies, indicating that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play a significant role in the reconstruction of the Iraqi oil industry, protected by decades of war and sanctions.
The US companies went with the equity participation to just two out of 10 fields.
Seven American companies paid for participation in the second auction, which started on Friday.
Only one presented a lost offer.
Two American companies reached an agreement on the field, which was prized in June.
The limited participation of American oil giants in the open Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war and the place of American companies you have here first on the Asian and European road, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq Oil Forum, online news.
It'll be a long time before something else is sold in Iraq.
Security concerns, highlighted by massively coordinated attacks on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the American army's landing, are likely to reflect American companies from a much more intensive company in Iraq, which has manifestly the third largest commodity reserves, analysts say.
In some cases, US companies were in disadvantages, in particular Chinese and other governments controlled energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that concluded agreements with the ministry.
The former American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhilips, who maintained close contact with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industry and offered technical assistance in the past years, left empty hands.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts awarded at the end of this week.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp. participated in offers on more contracts than all other companies and went with large shares in contracts on two main lines.
We all know that China is trying to become a major economic, as well as a technological force, spokesperson for the Assam jihad oil industry.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be comparable to competition and will be in line with its obligations towards Iraq.
The companies that were previously selected for the submission of tenders, which were then compared to the Ministry at the price of barrels and the Ministry is willing to pay for strengthening the output above the current level on each field.
The spy al-Qaeda planner was probably killed in Pakistan.
In the impact of the US missile on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, it is likely that the top-point planner of al-Qaeda operations was killed, as US Anti-Terrorism Department officials announced Friday.
As confirmed, it could be a second deadly attack on one of the highest leaders of terrorists.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who were killed when several rockets hit their car Thursday near Miran Şáh in the province of North Vaziristan, according to American sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities have alleged that the missiles were fired from the aircraft without a type of crew operating the CIA in a band of illegal indigenous tribes.
These were listed on the white car that directed to the Afghan border when it was hit, the official introduced together with the Pakistani cyclist, who called from Miran Šáh.
The official stated that the local armed forces had turned to the point and quickly had fun, which remained of "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. anti-terrorist officials quoted an unspecified witness who stated that Somalia was a posi death.
Somalia was designated as a highly established planning officer for al-Qaeda military operations, which led the operations of terrorist groups outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in the restoration of the world, said a senior official who did not want to be appointed who indicated the sensitive nature of the US air strikes in the territory of Pakistan.
If he held such a central position, he was likely involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He was instructed by the highest Al-Qaeda leadership and was planning possible terrorist attacks on the basis of them.
Another US official said that Somalia acted quickly in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He didn't have to be a known person in general for some Americans, but he didn't in any way humiliate himself to invite us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second highly established leader of al-Qaeda or Taliban who should be killed since September when Najmudin Jalolov was killed in a similar attack, the leader of the militant group of indigenous tribes, and three other chief populist leaders.
The rate of attacks initiated by the CIA using unmanned aircraft was reduced from the average of about six operations per month to two, according to Long War log reports, websites managed by a non-profit group.
The reduction may be justified in the improved tactics of terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also cruelly killing those suspected of being informants, has been cited by the website.
The United Nations High Representative in Kabul resigned.
The High Representative of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, stated on Friday that he would want to resign from his post in March and would end such a stormy period of operation, which was threatened by accusations of widespread corruption in the election of the President of Afghanistan, supported by the United Nations.
Eide's departure comes because Obama's administration has decided to send another 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN delegate stated that it was supporting growth, but expressed concern that the US timetable for reducing the state, which starts in 18 months, should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO states to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the building of Afghan security forces and send the correct signal to the Afghans that they have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment accepted must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian workers helping with the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The growth of the armed forces must be copied on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said he didn't get back, but he just fulfilled the promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he spent only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now stated he would need time to find a refund.
As I said, it's high time to look after the successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban started looking for a refund.
The officials stated that it was decided between Staffan di Misturou, who had a Swedish-Italian origin and had previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, France, who had previously led the UN peace operation.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former representative, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September of President Hamid Karzaim, who won the country's presidential elections in masking the presence of massive electoral machinery.
Eide rejected this claim, but stated that Galgraith's accusation -- which was released -- "certainly damaged the mission, because there was a high degree of skepticism in view of international intervention" at the time of the election.
Eide stated that he proposed a meeting with the highest representative of the citizens for coordinating the relief of the US forces in Afghanistan.
He also ordered the United Nations leadership to allow his successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to borrow them for the Afghan mission, because he said he wanted to strengthen their confidence that their money was properly spent.
Eide expressed disappointment at the limited efforts in Afghanistan and stated that the difficult UN regulation on leases undermines its ability to use its capacity.
The UN rules are such that I had the chance to get only one person since May, I said.
It's a disaster, and I can't keep going.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Minister of Defence Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers will soon set up "more significant sanctions" on Iran due to the lack of involvement in talks about his nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq during a week's journey through areas where war is being waged in Afghanistan and Iraq, was baggagetating the prospects of armed actions against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to the soldier's question of probable development.
One of the things that depends on me is whether I've learned something from Iraq in the last six years, [it] is unimaginable invisibility in the war.
Obama's administration has decided on a package of sanctions that could affect the Iranian military and political elite, but Gates has signaled that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iran.
He said "a package of incitement and bans" would require "to make the Iranian government really feel less secure with nuclear weapons", because "their inhabitants will suffer extremely" with sanctions.
According to the Friday opinion issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has taken the lead in warning that Iran will have serious consequences if it does not lead its nuclear programme to full compliance with the UN Committee on Nuclear Safety and its Supervisory Authority, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
In his talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he wanted to go back to the talks on limiting his nuclear programme and agreed to provide a substantial part of his enriched uranium supplies in exchange for the essential fuel for the reactor to carry out medical research.
The Administration established itself as such an agreement as a way of building trust between both parties and in order to obtain time for negotiations.
But since then, it seems, Iran is derogating from temporary agreements - partly because the expert points out, because Iraqi leadership is divided into opinions on whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, as regards Iran's stubbornness towards the international community in the case of some of the proposals that he actually agreed to in early October, I think that this brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese together, on a road that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against Iran, Gates said.
President Obama set a final deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to proposals before returning to the search for other elections including monitoring, which foreign ministers will call Hillary Rodham Clinton once called 'degrading sanctions'.
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations on Thursday condemned what it called "unreasonable and unsubstantiated charges" in front of some members of the Security Committee on Iranian nuclear activities and stated that it wanted to continue in talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before leaving for Kurdistan, rich in oil, to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with the Kurdish representatives in Irbil.
It remains high tensions between Kurd and the Iraqi majority, especially due to borders, ownership rights and income distribution.
Gtes insisted on both sides to reduce the potential for conflicts in order to prevent the retention of US plans to limit the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50000 by the end of August.
Gates was also trying to resolve Kurdish anxiety from persistent depression. US officials quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzaaní, President of the Kurdish regional government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in the United Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In Old China, Change in Course
Wang Weija and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that read that "The Earth's Mother is too exhausted to enjoy more children" and "One child in addition means one more grave".
Then they learned that when the official government seats in Shanghai, alarmed by low birth and ageing of the population in their city, suddenly changed the course this summer and began to encourage young couples, their reaction was immediate and determined: Never.
We've always devoted all our time and energy to just one child.
We left nothing for the other, says Wang, 31 years old, human resources manager who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years of China's lasting policy of having only one child was introduced, creating only two generations of notorically chubby and gypsy children, affected by "small emperors", the country threatens the population crisis.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple compared to six before the policy entered into force, according to the United Nations data.
Distribution of the population, where the number of inhabitants aged 60 and above is predicted to rise sharply from 16.7 per cent in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This is far above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
Inequality is greater in rich coastal cities with a population with higher education, for example in Shanghai.
Last year, 60 - year - olds and older made up nearly 22 percent of the registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission for Population and Family Planning, said many couples must have children to "help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and reduce the employment rate in the future".
He says it's about "to be old, it doesn't mean to be rich -- like in developed countries, like Japan or Sweden."
Slowing up
As was introduced into the country's constitution in 1978, the Chinese policy of a child is probably the most controversial mandate of the Communist Party governments.
The two who broke the policy were subjected to irrefutable torture -- until their three-year payment in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
China's official posts have promoted a policy that has helped the country to prevent critical waste of natural resources, while human rights defenders have been condemned in promoting politics.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women in the second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many two had to undergo sexist election losses, leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, population officials have been gradually smaller in their opinion on a child's policy.
In 2004, the number of exceptions - including city residents, members of national minorities and cases where men and women were singles - were reduced in 2007 by the dikes of their strong lines.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor of population research at Beijing University, said that central government officials had already debated radical changes, as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was a single.
In June Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight there were posters urging parents to have only one child replaced by copies of the regulation, detailing how to have another child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration sent officials to plan families and volunteers to meet with couples in their homes and put airplanes under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice for those who decided to have more than one child.
The response was cold, the family planning officials were introduced.
Aggravating response
Although officials in one rural town around Shanghai noticed an increase in interest in the two who wanted to have a second child after the campaign began, most urban districts did not report changes.
Huinan city district with a population of 115,000, for example, still registered four to five cases a month.
Disillusioned officials in Shanghai stated that despite the campaign, the number of people born in the city in 2010 is still expected only around 165000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, the head of the family planning committee in the Shanghai district of Caol, stated that financial considerations were probably the main reason people don't want to have more children.
They want to give the best of the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said she would like two children and they were legally allowed to do so.
But as many Chinese who have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a customs network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West view the politics of one child as a controversial legal issue, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is in the seventh month of pregnancy in relation to the first child.
Yes, we were tempted to have more than one child.
But the only problem is politics.
It's about money.
Other couples point to psychological reasons for weight gain.
Wang, the human resources manager, says they only have one child, because she was also the only one: "We were the center of attention of our families and all cared for us.
We weren't used to providing care, and we didn't really want to take care of each other.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who was a member of the translation company, said it was much less covert.
For two-carrying parents in the middle class who had reduced pregnancy, he said to be successful means to be selfish.
Today, 20 and 30 years of age, adults look at their parents as the first days of the Czech experiment with capitalism and do not want this way of life for themselves, he says.
Just one child puts enormous demands on parents' time, he says.
The mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are still controversial questions to the prostor -- "You have to stop your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You have to have a summary prepared at the time when the child is 9 months for a good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle with one child, says Che, but not with two.
We're the first generation with higher standards of living, he says.
We don't want to bring too many victims.
The United Nations Group set up a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by a long-term undeclared position and mutual association -- refocused on the release of a document on Friday, which proposes ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas emissions over the next 40 years with industrialised nations, with no burden in the near future.
The text, which may provide a starting point for the final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as the road ahead.
But there was significant progress in the negotiations that took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders coming to Codana next week.
Created by the UN ad hoc working group, this text unmistakably indicates how much money rich countries should provide to those poor people to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a whole range of key issues choices, including how to develop and manage emerging economies in order to limit their carbon output and what the upper limit of global temperature should be, which political actors will still be able to tolerate.
It provides a process of great flexibility, says John Coequitt, the top representative of the Washington Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who proposed a six-page document, deleted from 180 pages of the text of the discussion to focus on what the top climate officer at the UN, Yvo de Boer, described as a "great picture".
It sets out the limits for the possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly limit their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent per year compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries could reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent during this period.
Together, the country would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union quickly agreed on Friday that it would provide $3.6 billion over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to climate change -- from flood management and drought to depleting.
On Friday, however, the tennis player set up a type of verbal fireworks that they were considering during the last week’s talks.
The US Special Envoy for Climate Issues Todd Stern rejected the statement requiring binding restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries in comparison with the voluntaryity of major developing economies, unless they were financed by the developed world.
The Posun signaled that Obama's administration had made a harder line towards China without Bush's administrative officers just two years ago.
The United States will not accede to the Treaty without the transfer of major developing countries and the implementation of actions, Stern said, who also stated that the text was not sufficient to ensure restrictions and should be verified by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei informed the US chief climate negotiator that either the lack of "silence" or "unresponsibility" had led to a week earlier the announcement that the United States would not help China financially so that it could deal with global warming.
With the future of the economic course of the world's major powers at stake, the Tahanics both in the developing world and between the industrial world and the emerging economies.
The current struggle is being carried out by the majority of individual economies rather than by the preservation of the planet, between China and the United States, with regard to the fulfilment of their respective commitments, while poorer nations point out that two tenths of the world's most influential countries ignore the scientific imperative to carry out the most important actions.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegation of Costa Rican, said it is not surprising that the main powers are fighting about who should bear the costs of limiting greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries became much more aggressive in finding a way to forbid large issuers responsible for their actions.
It is a clear game of the development of new economic hegemony, Ulate, who also serves as regional adviser to regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international nature protection.
Some of the countries that are the most vulnerable to climate change have indicated that they would like to continue to promote a legally binding agreement in Kodana, though most of the main participants, said that the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, created a 24-page proposal for an agreement last Friday morning.
Arthur Runge-Metzger, who led the international climate negotiations for the benefit of the European Commission, said that prosecuting small island nations "brought political pressure on the entire polar process" partly because they are now united and require action from emerging economies, such as China and India.
The action sparked new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining controversial issues before the heads of the government were involved in the agreement.
High position officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister, stepped out of the aircraft and ran the halls of the centre of Bell to close the door and new conferences so they could delete the claims that will be assessed next week.
The total scope of the meeting - when 13000 people moved from and to the convention centre every day, the guitars playing activists staged at night ironizing themselves about the countries they thought they had sent them, and there was a hand-to-hand transmission of proposals to the paper rather than an electronic mail -- a call.
The intensity is just a superstructure: almost all key ministers were present in Kodana and earlier in the middle of 60 heads of states.
We got into high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said the Deputy Minister of Global Policy for International Nature Protection.
Heavy weights are coming.
British first train with a speed of 140 miles per hour pre-defined this Monday's feeling
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday night, the witch cut the darkness on the sign of leaving the train, which meant the revolution of transport in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach 140 miles per hour and take off from Ashford in Kent to London's St Pancras and exceed 58 miles per 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs. Kelly Holmes and entered the first high-speed personal assembly outside of London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain with the international networks of fast, reliable trains, and connect the great globalisation of Midland, North and Scotland with London.
Marked standing water should be reduced in passenger transport times and on commercial routes and the transition from aeroplanes and cars to railways could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate road congestion.
The three main political parties were theoretically allowed to obtain this vision.
But tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable fight for projects and concerns about environmental damage have now accelerated the construction of British high-speed rails.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, transmitted its message to Lord Adonis on December 30, as the Times reported.
It provided him with a detailed map of the route of another planned stage of high-speed network.
The new crossing of London's connection with Western Midland was designed within five metres in urban areas and quarters, where access to life centers could be problematic.
In the open area, the final route was planned up to 25 m.
HS2 also expects to determine three options for the extensive high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will answer to the spring.
The preferred choice is the confiscation of the form of the Y letter, when one high-speed line should lead to Western Midland.
The trail should be shared near Birmingham with one branch, passing from Pennsylvania to Manchester and Scotland and the other, leading north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over Tyne.
One line should lead to Scotland.
"It seems that the most effective choice has been made," said the ironman.
Once it's done, the driving times between London and Edinburgh will be two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be opened before 2025, could allow the traveler to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the presence.
The proposals should allow trains to drive 2250 miles per hour, which would make it the fastest out of the British network in Europe.
The initial track is already designed to remove trains in a length of 400 m that would be able to transport 1100 people.
Up to 18 joints could operate every hour on the London - Birmingham track.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve up to 20,000 passengers in an hour if needed.
In view of the capital restriction, it is assumed that existing stations would expand to include a high-speed network.
Railway industry experts claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not come before the general elections.
Even if he puts the car in motion, the network should be built in parts.
Trains should first be put into service, not on high-speed tracks, but on existing tracks north of Birmingham and maintain driving times between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This is considered a decisive starting point for ensuring the transition from aircraft to train, a reference point for the railway revolution.
Tax payers paid a mortgage of 75,000 pounds on Tory's orange
Alan Duncan, the holder of the Tory's front desk in the MP's studio, paid taxable persons a thousand pounds last year for the orange he built in his house in the electoral district.
the spokespersons for the prison, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that the MPs lived "by virtues", increased his mortgage to 75,000 pounds to build a deep-covered expansion in his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to account for a special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds per month of taxpayers.
The public authorities approved the claims in time and thus were not questioned by Sir Thomasen Legge, who carried out the control of the Member States' expenditures. Last night Mr. Duncan expressed his demands "it could have been cleaner or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of Parliament's richest members, owns two two-storey houses for everyone in his electoral district, Rutland and Melton.
Houses have a value of about a million pounds.
On the ground floor there is a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the financial office has agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year he added to the winter garden house, which is named "orangerie" in the plans.
Neighbors describe it as "a glass of fun and hospitality."
Mr Duncan was not asked to provide some explanation for the increased loan during the last check by the General Standards and Privilege Committee in the last mortgage settlement.
The committee informed him last month that he had violated the rules after reviewing his expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the papillary security to a mortgage of 271406 libre from his property in London to a house in his electoral district, which he purchased in 1991, year before becoming a member of the MP's settlement.
The documents released this week showed that Mr. Duncan claimed about 1,400 pounds a month in the interest of the mortgage until March of last year.
In April, his claims increased to over 1,800 pounds a month.
The interest in RBS's mortgage mortgages could not change at this time, which suggests that all of this was intended to finance a loan of 75000 pounds.
In December 2007, the standard exchange rate RBS decreased from 7.94 per cent to 4 per cent in March of the year in which it remained.
The last document by the general authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to claim 1250 pounds a month in May.
Mr. Duncan left his job as a shadow leader of the House in September after a secret reporter filmed it and said that the MPs had to survive the expense scandal.
"In principle, it's national, you have to live for the benefit and it treats you like s**t."
He said, "I have lost my money for my garden and my property and a small fraction of what I needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won't do it."
The envoy, a millionaire of the former career as an oil trader, was first called upon to explain his release in May when it turned out that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, even before the approval of the financial authority, that it could be "considered excessive".
One of the activists dug a pit in the form of a librarian in Mr. Duncan's lawn for a protest after it was discovered that he had claimed 4,000 pounds for three years.
When asked last night for an increase in mortgage, Mr. Duncan said, "It was because of an increase in capital, which was approved by both the financial authorities, and then by law."
He added: "This is not a controversial question of hiding and clicking or violating rules or anything else.
It's absolutely equal to the line down, according to the rules, and that's all.
This could not be much more clean or simpler in other ways."
All of you come to watch the chat on the brightton coast with the advent calendar.
Coastal chats in Brighton found new meaning of life in the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that excites the industrial use of creativity called on 24 owners to earn their chats for every day in December, and to use Christmas collections as the theme of this prize.
The event began on December 1st, when it allowed visitors to view the last chat from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, and the bishop bread and fried wine, provided free of charge.
Selected colleges included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, when the chat represented the work of Janet Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50 years old, an assistant to television marketing from Howe, is a priest without a scholarship in the chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion much more important for people in post-Christian society.
"Why do we as a church expect people to come to a foreign old building? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in an exciting way.
"The idea of an advent calendar in chats was just created as a conversation with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and pulsating place and we have tried to try and present it in a spiritual way."
Strong mobilization in Kodana and in the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people went to the streets on Saturday, demanding a significant and binding agreement to fight global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Kodana, demonstrated throughout the world where hundreds of people were arrested by the police on that occasion.
At least 30 thousand people, according to police sources, and hundreds of thousands according to organizers, were in the cold weather in the Danish capital at the occasion of the UN climate conference, with a view to adopting a Friday agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, said that increasing global mobilization, with clear evidence of current manifestations, contributed to the "political tax" of possible failure in Kodani being too high.
According to the AFP newspaper, incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the birth, when the group of approximately 300 demonstrators dressed in black began to break out the exhibits with the beads and beads.
The police were immediately hit by the police.
The police announced the arrest of between 600 and 700 people and clarified that it was particularly the members of the Blacks Blocks, ultra-radical independent groups, which had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
Koalice Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the action, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "no difference" and stressed that about a hundred of them were in the streets and in the seat "remained in the streets on Saturday night" and even in the extreme winter.
After Parliament was abandoned, the way in peace was directed towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to penetrate inside.
For speakers there was a stage before which a spiritual meeting was held at the candles for the participation of the former South African Archbishop of the City of Desmond Tutu.
Most Protestants arrived by bus and train from large European cities and, apart from Africans, there were also a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue strippers, created the first assembly in the morning hours in Kodana, and that at the call of the Friends of the Earth group, who wanted to create "blue waves" for "just climate".
Today, we go to the streets to demand the settlement of environmental debt in favour of the South, explained People Nacpil, a Philippine warrior from the Jubilee South Coalition in Kodani.
We can't say anymore: it's time for this to be declared by the Benin singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa rivers and rivers are dried, we can walk in them today, and it has never been possible before.
For the first time in history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 following the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of the struggle for another world has approached ecological organizations.
French European Ambassador José Bové, one of the characters of the struggle for another world, said that he came to Kodana with the aim of "committing climate and social justice". "At present there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The first events began in the Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands especially sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, about 50,000 people went to the streets according to the organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, were walking in red clothes and with boxes that evoke the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred demonstrators went to the street demanding a major action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseilles (them), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyons (outside), participated in protests organized by "350".
There were dozens of people in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia chose her president, Georgia judged it "fashku"
Abkhazia elected her president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist territory as independent in Georgia, Tbilisi is declaring this step "fashk".
About 131000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 on control of the South Ossetia, which is another former Georgian territory recognised by Russia.
The election rooms closed in 17h GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission, the participation was 58% a few hours before the closing of the election rooms.
The first preliminary results should be announced at night from Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including President-in-Office Sergei Bagapš, categorically reject the idea of joining Georgia, which condemned these elections.
These choices are a freckle.
On the other hand, Georgian President Michail Saakashvili "is sorry that Abkhazia has fallen completely into Russian rule," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, the independence of the region was recognised by 216,000 people only in Nicaragua and Venezuela, while the rest of the world considered it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by the Russian forces.
After the division from Georgia, after the 1992-1993 conflict, in which thousands of people were killed, Abkhazia is trying to show through the elections that she is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, the new era of our independent state, said the AFP Kvarčija Svetlanová, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted that she voted for President Bagapše.
She was one of those who came to the school's election room in the capital of Suchuma, to the beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The question of Russian sovereignty is the main theme of the presidential elections in this region on the Black Sea, which can be proud of its beautiful nature.
After all this small country with 216,000 inhabitants, huge billboards with Bagaps are located next to Russian President Dmitri Medvedeva and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gala, on the west side of the country, Russian officials who came to look after the moderate course of the elections reached a warm reception by the periodic archival of Beslan Aršby.
"We, Abchaz, said gratefully" at a small ceremony, having in mind the support of Moscow and, in particular, its decision to recognise the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament and added glass vodka to it.
The opposition, which was represented in the elections by former Vice-President Raul Khadzimbou and two merchants Zaus Ardzinbou and Beslan Boutbou, criticised contracts concluded last year with Moscow, such as an agreement that enables Russia to control the Abkhazia rail network for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support the current government or opposition.
For victory in the elections, the upper half is required 50% plus one vote.
If any of the candidates do not achieve this result, the decision-making struggle shall take place within two weeks.
Climate: World events, events in Kodana
Tens of thousands of people went to the streets on Saturday, demanding a substantial and binding agreement to fight global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Kodana, demonstrated around the world where about 700 people were arrested by the police on that occasion.
At least 30 thousand people, according to police sources, and hundreds of thousands according to organizers, were present in the cold weather in the Danish capital, which hosts up to 18 December of 193 countries, on an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
After Parliament was abandoned, the way in peace was directed towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to penetrate inside.
For speakers there was a stage before which a spiritual meeting was held at the candles for the participation of the former South African Archbishop of the City of Desmond Tutu.
According to the AFP newspaper, incidents occurred shortly after the birth when a group of several sets of demonstrators, dressed in black and armed shields and shields, began to break out.
The police immediately surrounded them and struck them without waiting, and several demonstrators hit the ground.
The police announced the arrest of between 600 and 700 people and clarified that it was particularly the members of the Blacks Blocks, ultra-radical independent groups, which had already appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
Later in the afternoon, one police officer was injured and four cars were burned near a squad near the incident that resulted from police sources holding about 20 people.
We're focusing on extremist groups, he warned the speaker police Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the police flew back into the air.
Most of the protestors who arrived by bus or train from large German cities from London, Amsterdam and Milan were European origins.
But there were also many Asians, including several Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, dressed mostly in blue strippers, created the first meeting in the morning in Kodana to challenge the group Friends of the Earth, who wanted to create "blue waves" for "righteous climate".
Today, we go to the streets to demand the settlement of environmental debt in favour of the South, explained People Nacpil, a Philippine warrior from the Jubilee South Coalition in Kodani.
We can't say anymore: it's time for this to be declared by the Benin singer Angelique Kidjo.

Oxfam has invited several famous personalities, such as the Danish model Helen Christensen or the former UN Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, to speak for the davit.
The first events began in the Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands especially sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, about 50,000 people went to the streets according to the organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students in red clothing, and with bands vocating the importance of solar energy, were present in front of the council of the capital of the Philippines.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, a number of hundreds of demonstrators also met with the requirement of an important measure against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseilles (them), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyons (outside), participated in protests organized by "350".
There were dozens of people in Geneva.
The themes of the geography and the magazines will be strengthened in the framework of the reform of the general gymnasium, Chatel said.
The Minister of Education Luc Chatel stated on Sunday during a discussion for the JDD magazine that the articles of history and geography will be "strengthened" in the framework of the reform of the general gymnasium, although their education will no longer be mandatory in the last year of the gymnasium with a focus on accurate science.
Now all students of the second year will have four hours a week and will also have the same program from the general culture, Chatel confirmed.
According to the Minister, "you have to end up with a cover", because according to him, specialization S is no longer focused on accurate science" but "in essence there are the best students in it".
The specializations of the EC and L cannot be with any sub-specializations, it continues and emphasizes: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would complain that in the last year of the professional gymnasiums there is no geography and history."
A study by the agency Ifop, which published the Humanité Journal on Saturday, showed that seven French out of ten (69%) did not agree with the government's project to abolish compulsory education of the journal and geography in the Mauritian Year with specialization S, therefore many intellectuals and teachers criticised both the left and some Members of the right.
On the contrary, the Minister added that "not in mind" to abolish philosophy in the specialization programme S of the graduation year.
At the same time, Luc Chatel defended reform in the education of teachers, while 16 organizations (students and committees) called for participation in Tuesday mobilization against this project, which they considered to offer educational education to future professors of gymnastics.
During the Master's study 2 (M2), the Minister explained at the beginning of the annual acceptance test based on their field and at the end of the year the further test verifying their ability to teach.
The participants will attend the training courses during the second year of the Master's degree and the first year will be presented as a professor-internship teacher before the students.
If you count all the records that will be offered to you before the reception procedure, you will have more experience with students, almost 300 hours, continued .
The Minister also announced that he would propose "personal right to education", which so far does not exist in national education.
He confirmed the project to cancel the school map by 2012.
At the elite University of École, normal superiors have 15 minutes to convince them of the climate.
Fifteen minutes to the presentation of the goals of the Kodán Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel announced in the Chamber in the morning, a multi-president of the International Climate Development Expert Group (GIEC) to encourage the Ecole Normal Superiority University on Ulm Street.
As one AFP journalist reported, Nobel laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the Ernest conference, which is a one-day seminar composed of fifteen-minute contributions from experts who will be recorded and opened to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people, and based on what they would like to learn more, he explained on the occasion of the 22-year conference, Edward Hanneso, one of the organizers of this seminar, which was named after the fish from the local lake, which the students so named.
It is estimated that 20 contributing experts from individual scientific disciplines are selected and clarified that the selection is based on their charisma.
About warming the climate "we can talk for hours, but we can also set basic targets in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke before 50 listeners without pre-prepared notes, only by graphs.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed with the hope that listeners will know that "Codian conference is based on very seriously prepared scientific bases".
The videos on these lectures will be posted on the school's website from December 15th.
The next "Ernest" seminar is scheduled for February and the next one will follow with regularity every two months.
Delay in payments: anger of prison guards, planned measures
The committees of the prison supervisors announced "general mobilization" on Friday, as they demand that they be paid the premium and the time-frame for which the remuneration was postponed for financial reasons.
Prison FO (2nd Committee of Supervisors) asked employees who would not have the service to participate in demonstrations held in the morning before the prison facilities, and to "block them" and thus alerted them to "the theft of their wages".
The CGT for Prison Supervisors (the 3rd committees of this sector) has called for "to call for meetings in individual prisons and to start basic mobilization" by "sudden and unacceptable" so that "times and allowances for work at night, on Sundays and on holidays" worked in October are not punished in December.
The first committees of supervisors, the Federal Union of Prison Supervisors (Ufap/Unsa), "proclaims for total mobilization (...) with the aim of showing dissatisfaction and exhilaration".
The Executive Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtime has increased considerably in 2009 and that not all have been included in the financial budget, but ensures that the amounts due will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Office stated that Michèle Alliot-Mariová had sent a message to the committees of the prison supervisors to ensure that the payment would be made next month.
I know of the efforts made by the prison staff to ensure the functioning and modernization of our prison system, says the ministry in its communication.
I have ordered the managing director of the prison to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation, which arose with a poor assessment of the number of times, has never been repeated in the future, added the Minister Alliot-Mari.
So, with the exception of management workers who receive a famous award for the performance of their functions and objectives, the salary will be low, and for those who "will always be in the budget".
It's just a scandal, the interregional FO Union in Marseille has been burned down, and announced its decision to boycott to revoke "all meetings and talks".
Employees will not come to work on Sundays or on holidays unless they are paid in December for these days from October, as well as in the meantime, FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne is also at risk.
At a time when we are being given more work and more tasks without providing us with other staff, it is sad to allow them to pay the lowest position of the staff, says the CGT prison supervisors in Bordeaux.
According to the Committees, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are better than others.
However, in any case, because little, the Secretary-General of Ufap, Jean-François Forget, noted.
Both say he's giving "better gifts" for Christmas than he's getting
American President Barack Obama, who prepares for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, committed "bohyni" to Oprah Winfrey's screen that as far as gifts are concerned, he has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than those I get."
The president and his wife, Michelle, spoke in a special edition of the series, which will be broadcast on Sunday evening at the ABC station about how they are going to celebrate Christmas and end of the year in their new and prestigious homes.
Even Bo, a small four-year-old family partner, will get his advantage.
Jesus also likes Boa, said Michelle Obama by saying that the dog will also get a gift "of course" as it comes from the harvests of the pre-sending order.
And Michelle Obama also defended herself against her husband's claim on the quality of the gifts that she received: "No, I gave you the first gifts last year," the president regretted.
Well, of course it's true, he was forced to agree with the president, but immediately with a sense of humor he showed his finger on the first lady's pearl necklace: "And who gave you this?"
In this one-hourly very relaxed series with a famous moderator who strongly supported Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, Obama's husband also talked about their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama set up a round with a ten-degree transfer, but also a basketball ball dedicated to his father’s Christmas, who met only very rarely.
I remember seeing my father coming to see us on Christmas and giving me that basketball ball, the president told me.
Long after that, I realized that the ball actually gave me it.
The first lady remembered the doll house again.
I didn't know how to organize everything in the house, and so I fixed all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around the blood, but the little house I loved for the ladies remembered Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday is again operated, RTL indicates he's in artificial sleep
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles for the reason of the "damaging" caused by the larger operation he had performed in France, but the situation is according to his closest "under control", while the RTL station stated that the singer is in artificial sleep to prevent pain and complications.
The 66th-year-old rocker was again operated from Wednesday night to Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, after American doctors found a "harm resulting from the operation" of the hot plate that he invented in Paris on November 26, announced to his printing department in Paris that these lay required a "correct operation".
However, the singer's press department tried to calm the public and stated that the situation was "under control" and at the same time announced that new medical communications would be issued within 48 hours.
According to the RTL station, which is the main player of the last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into artificial sleep to prevent "sickness and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens our eyes, we'll have a little bit more security, he adds RTL.
The press department did not confirm or comment on the AFP's question.
RTL also states that, according to "some sources", no wood was placed after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was operated at the international clinic Parc Monceau because of a heated plot.
The surgery, which was planned several days ago, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a well-known doctor in artistic circles.
However, the doctor was not available on Thursday to provide RTL information.
After this operation, the singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized on Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for the infection that occurred after surgery.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday's, said Thursday on the radio RTL that his friend was just going through "bad time", but added that he was a rocker "weekly care", because it's a big "warmer."
He called me right before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was making a fool because spending 12 hours on a plane after such an operation is no fun, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, he calmed down the situation of the singer, Jean-Claude Camus, who said that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well on antibiotics", and that the infection was "stopped".
Mr. Camus also said that he met with Laeticia, a wife singer, and that he didn't notice any special concerns.
The health problems of the singer only come from July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to the surprise of all, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday was operated on a "small tumor of thin intestine" and then on a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which was presented as his farewell.
But since then, each of his health problems has been very closely monitored and commented. Fanouš and reporters have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on the scene.
In mid-November, his team again had to decompose the news of new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: Prime Minister Bousquet in his favorite discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-dimensional medalist at the World Championship in 2009 in the large swimming pool, won a title at the 2009 European Championship in a small swimming pool in Istanbul, which he especially likes: 50m free way.
The first day of the championship, on which the combinations are finally allowed, only three world records fell, although they were expected to be much more.
One of them won the Hungarian competition Evelyn Verrasztová at 200 m of ground race and two remaining Russian men's staff at 4x50 m of ground race.
A big scarf for Bousqueta, who made a glimpse of the world record in a 50 m free way, which is already a holder in a large pool (20,94).
In one of the two royal disciplines of swimming, 50m free way, the 28-year-old French won the final 20.53 seconds in the finals at which the prime minister launched ten swimmers instead of the usual eights.
Bousquet defeated Croatia Duje Draganja (20,70) and Rusa Sergei Fesikova (20,84), but failed to overcome the world record (20,30), as he predicted.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if there's a world record in my reach, I'll try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers had combinations made of polyurethane that would be prohibited from 1 January.
The combinations have helped from February 2008 to 238 world records and their era ends in Istanbul, which is the first host in 1999 to compete in the same competition.
The use of the combination this time did not help even the Germans Paul Biedermann, a double world master in a large swimming pool in Rome, who had a world record for the reach of the hand.
The young swimmer failed to win a record that holds 400 meters free (3:32.77), but won the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), in front of the Russian racer Nikit Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't put everything in the race.
I knew I wasn't going through the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent to the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: Romanian sarcophagus board belonging to Zolova was issued $1.5 million
The board of the Roman sarcophagus, which did not belong to anyone other than the French writer Emil Zolvi, was issued on Thursday for $1.5 million, which is significantly more than was estimated, said a merchant with the art Sotheby ́s.
The price of these two meters long and 63 cm high front boards, from the third century of our airport, was estimated to be between $150,000 and $250,000.
Marble "representing four dionysus scenes in the elaborate architectural decoration, surrounded by satires and bakchants is a rare work, similar pieces are very little in the world, perhaps four or five," announced AFP on Tuesday Florent Heintz, Vice President of the auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art at Sotheby's.
The work was sold among hundreds of others.
The sale is still going on, but it's the object that was probably the biggest one, told the agency of the AFP spokesperson Sotheby's, Dan Aberneth.
The fact that Emile Zola ordered this marble was found a few days ago.
The board was almost 300 years old in Rome in a famous collection of the Borgia family and then gradually appeared with the French actress Cecile Sorel, who enjoyed the bath in her private hotel in Paris and with Paul Reynaud, the Minister of the Third Republic of France and the short President of the Council before coming to power of Petina.
She's been stuck there for about 50 years.
Florent Heintz found in the database of the museum in Louvre that this board was part of the "residues of Emil Zoly" opened since 1903, a year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
A interrupted attempt to get President Zelay from Honduras to Mexico.
Mexico concluded on Thursday that the conditions for the carriage of the proposed President of Honduras, Manuel Zelayi, were not met, which the rebels refused to provide a guarantee of safe departure.
After the telephone conversation I had last night with President Zelay, everything for the time being shows that there is no way to achieve this transport, the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinos, has introduced.
The Mexican government aircraft, which flew to Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelay, flew back, introduced the source of the Directorate-General for Migration.
The cleaning government wanted to bring President Zelay to the "demise" and to ask for political asylum abroad, only to allow him to leave safely.
But the rejected president rejected these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as an exile head of state.
The government of cleaners "have experienced further failures when I wanted to give up my function (...), wanted me to give up the demise," said Zelaya Radio Globe on Thursday, in which he often expressed himself to the political crisis that has lasted in this Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I've got my guitar here, I've added the President-in-Office, hidden at the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and played a couple of chords.
Mexico's Embassy asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transport, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, the Minister of Interior told the Hungarian Radio HRN, Oscar Raul Matute on Wednesday.
I'm not going to ask for asylum from any country, said Manuel Zelaya in the interview for the Telesur station, which has a seat in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I'll leave as President of the Honduras people, he's stressed.
The news of Zelay's departure was mobilized in the middle of the president's palace, who came to gather around Brazil's embassy, where the army strengthened its defense.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Puritan government.
They're showing their marginal attitude to international standards, added.
Zelaya, who approached the Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, was dismissed on 28 June, on the day he organised a public consultation in preparation for his re-election and against the recommendation of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
From exile in Costa Rica, he returned unexpectedly on 21st January and found refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he gets out of here, he'll be arrested and held responsible for the crime of the "Veezrady", from which he's accused, the corrupt government claims.
On 29 November, clean president Roberto Micheletti was able to hold presidential elections to replace President Zelayi.
In the controversial elections recognised by the United States but convicted by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later Congress voted against the return of President Zelayi to power until the end of his mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street picks up, U.S. trade balance bids for optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended Thursday with a rise and the results of the US trade balance testify to the rise in both the United States and its partners: Dow Jones earned 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to data from the final conclusion, Dow Jones Industrial Average has improved from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance from 7,13 points to 2190.06 points.
Index Standard & Poor 500 has improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news from various parts of the economy, Lindsey Piegzová from FTN Financial commented.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market focuses on half a full glass.
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focus primarily on US trade balance numbers, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The balance of trade in the United States fell by 7.6% in October to $32.9 billion.
The analysts were expecting an increase in the trash.
There has been an increase in both imports and exports.
A great news is the growing volume of trade, in particular the export of goods, reflecting the growth of the economies of the major trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell from the research company Economy.com.
However, in the United States last week, unemployment rose against all expectations and the number of employers reached 474,000.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new entrants has dropped "at the lowest in this year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The stock market has also dropped.
The 10-year-old stock surplus increased to 3,482% against 3,423% on Tuesday night and the profit of 30 increased to 4,492% against 4,408% the day before.
Cuba : hundreds of regime supporters wrote "Dams in White"
A number of hundreds of Cuban regime defenders made a statement Thursday by the wife of political prisoners who met in Havana on the occasion of the World Day of Human Rights and prevented further demonstrations to which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About forty "Dam in White", a wife or close political prisoners were posted directly on the street of the Raula Castra regime in their march towards the centre of the capital, requesting the release of the political prisoners, the journalist reported.
Away with Yankees!, "Golden!", "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!", "Let Fidel and Raul live!" were scandalized by the high-end resistance of the regime to dissidents.
The dissidents were finally escorted by civil personnel who came "safety".
The day before, there was a similar demonstration against "Dams in White" in Havana, but there was neither injury nor arrest.
But in Vedado's Havana district, police officers were detained in a civilian camp of about ten dissidents, who were also about to protest on Thursday on the occasion of World Day of Human Rights, the AFP journalist informed.
According to this newspaper, police have imposed dissidents that have been drafted by government officials into civilian vehicles for the use of force.
The arrest of dissidents under similar conditions takes only a few hours.
The holders of the 2005 European Parliament's Sacharov Prize, "Dams in the White", organised an unauthorized profit for "the release of all, according to the disentent, of about 200 political prisoners", introduced one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda was sentenced to 20 years in prison.
Mr Maceda is one of the 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom 53 are still on the net.
The Cuban authorities consider support for the "belts" or "agents" paid by their criminal enemy, the United States.
A complete miracle, Cuban television reported a Thursday demonstration of the government regime's regime against the "refugees of the revolution".
Cuba, with the Communist Party in its head and the government's policy, is regularly accused by European or American non-governmental organisations of non-compliance with human rights and freedoms, including freedom of expression.
A knife-killer killed an 80-year-old man and injured five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A prostitute armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five other people in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at the peak on Thursday afternoon.
According to the preliminary findings of the investigation, the attacker at the age of 28 allegedly attacked two knives and for unknown reasons of the 80-year-old in or before the hospital, at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is the version of the police and witnesses.
The heavily injured old gentleman, born in 1929, died according to the Alliance police union in the hospital for the consequences of the injury.
In this medicine or before it, the attacker attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
A husband in his 30 ’ s began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where an 80-year-old man died.
The life of a second injured person is in danger, according to police sources, it is likely that vital authorities have been affected.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was transferred to the hospital "in shock," the police source said.
An armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as the police source pointed out, then fled to the street, still on the boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He injured two more, apparently by accident: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old man, seriously the other.
As it all happened, it's not quite clear, because it all happened in the evening.
He was armed with two cutting knives carrying a cross behind his back, said at the location of the Alliance's leading union in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several cyclists, including young people, tried to stop and arm themselves, according to the testimony of the AFP gathered.
I saw a 30-year-old guy in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commenting on Alberto's situation, a chaplain from a nearby bar.
He threw himself into a crowd, including a city police officer, who broke his wrist while he was playing.
Still at Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the level of 61, two police cities, including their leaders, tried to detain an armed man and were injured by the trees, the police source said.
The incident occurred in one of the main streets of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
The coroner came to tell me there's an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a seven-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and I noticed a big chest wound, told the agent AFP Frederic Allion, a 30-five-year-old doctor.
About five minutes later, a second person came, who also had stabbing wounds with a knife.
A man who didn't have any IDs was arrested after the state police.
The State Representative in Nanterre handed over the case to the District Police Department in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The suspect attacker was transferred to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody waiting for an inquiry.
The police source didn't exclude his location in a psychiatric clinic.
Another police source stated that there was a need for six police officers to take him to a police station in Clichy, where he was transferred.
He was "very out of his mind" as "all the crazys of this kind, whose power in action increases ten times."
USA: Polish lawyer again requests termination of criminal prosecution
The lawyer of the Polish-French director Romana Polanski again requested on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, the western United States) to stop the criminal prosecution against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence due to the ant affair that occurred thirty years ago.
Chad Hummel, the legal representative of the film director "Pianista" criticised three judges of the appeal court of the second period in California, a serious mistake that occurred at the time of the trial in 1977.
I demand that the appeal be suspended now and now, the lawyer Hummel introduced and added that, from the conduct of the judge who then decided on the case, Laurence Rittenband "had an ice in his back."
According to him, the judge (who had already died among them) was supposed to act with the State representative who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison — which is a serious violation of the rule of law.
Information on this interview was found in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and requested), from the mouth of the State Representative, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally declared at the end of September that he lied to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, Judge Hummel will require a court ruling in which he will be able to provide evidence of his claim.
The complainant reiterated what had already been said in the first state, because no serious examination of the application for suspension of criminal proceedings would occur until Roman Polanski was brought before the court.
The 76th senior director fled the United States in 1978, before the court ruled on "unlawful sexual contact" with an unaccompanied girl at the age of 13.
Ever since then, he has never entered the territory of the United States again.
Deputy Prosecutor of Los Angeles, Phyllis Asayam, said Roman Polanski "should be there to attend the trial."
In this case, we want to point out not only to the Roman of Poland, but also to the other accused that it is possible to escape?
It is the view that the director "requests favor in court and at the same time honors his authority."
One of the three judges who now have 90 days to decide also stressed that "there are other alternatives to escape".
Lawyer Hummel wasn't himself who asked to stop Roman Polanski's criminal prosecution.
The victim's legal representative, Samantha Geimer, also again requested the termination of the criminal prosecution.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear the everlasting burden every time the Polish case was brought out and added: "No one in this room can say that the process was just".
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on Tuesday 26th in Switzerland for order USA
After more than two months behind the net, he was released to the domestic prison in his chaplain in Gstaad, where he was waiting for a possible demonstration.
Wall Street ends with no direction, he's jammed with a rising dollar.
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday without direction, the market disappears between indicators that are better than expected in the United States and the rising dollar price: Dow Jones won +0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to data from the final conclusion, Dow Jones Industrial Average moved from 65.67 points to 10,471,50 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance left 0.55 points and ended at 2.190,31 points.
Index Standard & Poor's 500 increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106,41 points.
Frankly, the market is very calm, Mace Blackxilver from Marblehead Asset Management introduced.
It's still in a tight range, the volume of the trade has been very low, and I think it'll stay until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that were better than expected, and which " helped improve the market mood with regard to the stability of economic recovery," analyst Charles Schwab said.
In the United States, the retail market grew by 1.3% in November, the second month after itself and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index, the trust of American consumers also returned and grew to 73.4 versus 67.4 in December last month.
However, the indices have been speeded up by a new increase in the dollar price for the euro, which is highest in the last two months, which "presses down the sector sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank.
That's how technological action loses the ground under his feet.
The stock market has dropped.
The rate of government spending with a view to 10 years increased by 3,540% against 3,482% on Wednesday night and with a view to 30 years, it increased by 4,497% against 4,492% on the previous day.
The Miss World election again in the South African Republic.
After a month's journey across the South African Republic, 112 candidates on the title Miss World are going to cross the target time on Saturday to reach their dream: being chosen by the most beautiful woman in the world in front of billions of TV viewers.
This great celebration of beauty has been held in Johannesburg since the second year, and in the meantime five candidates have obtained a procedure for the semi-final.
Miss Japan’s Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acostaová from Mexico, Mariatu Kargboová from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Maová from Canada were chosen during their African stay Miss sport or Miss top model.
It was a real faith of events.
It was wonderful to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth,Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen a lot of things and I've had so many experiences, Miss Sierra Leone committed.
The competition, which takes place in the South African Republic after the ninth, will be launched in a direct transfer from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from the 17th hour (15 hours of world time).
I couldn't figure out a more beautiful country where I'd put my crown in.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm happy that I could live it twice, she committed to Miss Xenia Sukhin's world, in the hot south summer.
For young Russia, her second residence in the South African Republic was carried in the spirit of frequent meetings with other candidates and a new discovery of the country and its "dreaming country".
After months of performances, tests, meetings with the press and safari, Miss is now focusing on the same competition.
Indka Poja Chopraová hopes to go in the footsteps of Priyany Chopra, elected in 2000, who will also participate in Ashwarye Rai, the 1994 winners, who became two Bollywood stars.
To be crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman's dream, but it's not just about sight.
We're polite to our countries, and I want to go home with a crown, says Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th anniversary will be in the spirit of music and dance.
The candidates are presented in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimwear.
The presentation will be presented by the Chinese TV moderator Angela Chow, former Queen of the beautiful South African Republic Michelle McLean and the chairman of the board of Miss Steve Douglas World.
The South African Republic has shown that it is able to welcome the world with the heat it is difficult to cope with, declared Julia Morley, president of Miss World Competition.
The candidates, like last year, attended the safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time on the bike, and enjoyed the local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was the meeting with South African President Jacob Zumou, who shook their hands.
For the unusual president, she noticed Miss Sierra Leone.
Without a doubt, the most beautiful memory will remain in Cape Town (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will take place in June 2010 and which helped the country to support the event more.
I could've met people I didn't even care about.
I'm sure I'm going back to the World Cup 2010, says with enthusiasm Miss Italy Alice Taticchi.
According to David's son, Hallyday's status is "very positive".
News of Johnny Hallyday's condition is "very positive", as his son David assured us on his Friday arrival at the airport in Los Angeles, where he flew to visit his father, who had been hospitalized for several days.
Reports are very positive.
He is very strong and everything is going very well, said David Hallyday on his departure from the plane that he flew from Paris at 13 a.m. local time (21 a.m. world time)
The singer's son, who acted peacefully, declared that he was "as fast as possible" to the Los Angeles hospital Cedars-Sinaï, to which Johny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for post-operative infection caused by the operation of a heated inter-breeding platinum, which took place on November 26th in Paris.
According to the press statement, the song was sung night in Los Angeles for the sake of convenience "introduced into artificial sleep", which should prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was a doctor at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles already referred to as an art sleep. Hospitalization was due to an infection after the operation of a heated inter-breeding plate carried out on November 26th in Paris.
For the serious damage caused by this attack , the singer had to be operated again at night from Wednesday to Thursday .
According to the photographer AFP, his wife Laeticia attended a school performance in the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, visiting their daughter Jade.
Advantage of orthopaedic surgery and traumatology hospital la Pitié-Salpétrière, Yves Catoné, announced that the singer to Los Angeles will fly on Monday.
The producer strongly accused Dr. Stéphana Delajouxe, a neurosurgeon who was operating at the Clinique international du Parc Monceau in Paris on 26 November.
They told us it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons have declared they're under arrest, said M. Camus.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, I said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "has gone too fast to Los Angeles and that with the permission of his Parisian surgeon."
Personally, I spoke to the doctor on the phone and he assured me that this trip was no problem, which surprised me greatly, since I had suffered twice as much as the inter-British plate.
A moment earlier at the radio station RTL stated that the singer apparently flew after the Paris operation without a drain, without anything."
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in artistic circles.
He operated the actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at a hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, which he then acted on.
In 2007, he also operated Charlotte Gainsbourg's acting in the elimination of the hematoma caused by brain bleeding.
However, he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, several times convicted in cases of neglect of medical care, tax evasion and fraud.
Dr. Olivier Metzner referred to him as "a man without a scar," who is "regularly" before the medical chamber, and who cannot be "recommendable far".
After several weeks of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux expressed himself on Friday through his lawyer David Koubbi.
He announced that the move had "a very good course" and the post-operative investigation was "normal".
The operation was not hemorrhagic, so it was not necessary to introduce the drain," he added.
The health problems of the singer have increased since this year, and in any case it seems that the next tour of the singer remains with the question.
It is obvious that the term of restoration of the planned tour on 8 January (In Amiensa, known as Reg.) appears to be too close, Camus declared.
The UDF Association raises the tone and calls on the New Centre to continue to use their shorts.
The UDF association, controlled by MoDemFrançoise Bayroua, responded to the attempt on Friday by the President of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morina on the abbreviation of the former Giscard party by not using any media in a short time under the threat of criminal harassment.
Herv Morin publicly announced his intention to assign a short UDF with the fact that François Bayru does not deserve to carry her inheritance after he hands the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of Movement Nouveau Centre (NC).
This step was supported by Hervé de Charet (formerly za-UMP now for NC), which is attributed to the ownership of the UDF brand, as it was the first to have it registered in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la propriété industriale).
But on Friday night, the Committee of the UDF-controlled friend Françoise Bayroua, who did not intend to be allowed to resign, resigned from his silence and filed a formal request to the Minister and the MPs to stop using short and return the ownership of the security marks, in the face of a threat of criminal harassment.
In recent days, you have raised the alarming statement that you propose to take over your political movement + take over a short UDF, writes the Association in your letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the Committee, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from MoDem or Senator Jean Arthuis of the Alliance Centrifuge.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your mobile phone name+New center+, with the slogan +UDF today+, signatories also identify the letter.
As you know, you have no right to use this brief, explains the UDF Committee, which wants to remove any mention of the name of UDF from all promotional materials including (its) websites."
At the same time, Hervé de Charettea asks "to hand over the ownership of trademarks to legitimate owners".
If you do not do so, we will turn to the courts to ensure that the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members are respected, signatories note.
In their letter they state that the UDF "is a full political movement in 1978" and point out that Mr. Morin and his friends "elected" to leave in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as did others in 2002 to set up the UMP.
The new centre is therefore not entitled, according to them, to use a short UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
At the same time, it is recalled that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and to set up a committee responsible for raising the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscardm d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charettea, the committee continues, "when he registered the protection mark", it was not "for three years as a member of the UDF", but the UMP.
In a scandalous and misleading way, he used the non-existing registration of acronyms to do so on his own account.
This inaction begins to turn into a criminal act, they declare, and then with irony they declare themselves to the NC strategy: "It seems to us that both in politics and in the ordinary life it is more valuable to create a name for ourselves than to come out of anonymity by subjugated names on which we have no right."
The Liliane Bettencourt case : François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of the state of weakness.
The court in Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist Françoise-Marie Banier and to judge whether he had used the state of weakness of the 80-year-old billionaires to prepare her for part of her estate, from which her daughter Liliane Bettencourt was guilty.
The photographer (62 years), known by his photographs of fame, will be sued on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of the state of weakness, which is a criminal offence for which the penalty is imposed for a maximum duration of 3 years and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This Decision confirms that the process of causation, which can be described as the family of the sag of one of the richest families in France, is in fact under attack by the mother of the daughter and is fighting for the control of the cosmetic empire of L'Oréal.
At the same time, the 15th criminal court ordered the 87-year medical examination of Liliany Bettencourt, which should be conducted by three doctors.
L'Oréal’s grandfather and principal shareholder always refused to undertake such an investigation, certainly not under the conditions offered by the representatives of the State in Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should prepare a report by 10 March 2010 and at the same time give an opinion on whether Liliana Bettencourt could be in a state of weakness and during what period.
I think she's gonna be there.
I'm going to talk to her about it. He announced after the hearing of Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kieiman.
As for lawyer Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Oliver Metzner, this decision was welcomed by the court.
It's an excellent report(...). The expert shows that with this old lady who needs protection, he has manipulated (M. Banier), confirmed.
Two years ago, the only daughter of Liliany Bettencourt started a criminal trial against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and an all-time artist who is guilty of using her mother's disability for years to obtain a billion euro in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master pictures.
So Liliane Bettencourt always refused to be manipulated by a photographer whom she considered to be a long-term friend.
While the court had to assess the legality of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the Friday judge's speech of lawyers changed at a time in the family's time of truth.
Lawyer Liliany Bettencourt submitted three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary, expressing his distrust of his husband Françoisy Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a letter from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt, according to the lawyer, adds: "You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier for fifteen years once to twice a day.
Ever since she got married, I've never been able to talk to Françoise."
The State representative in Nanterre once again found that the complainant’s proceedings were not admissible, since the supervisory judge in those days rejected her application to initiate proceedings for the issue of legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully able to participate in the court, is not under protection or custody.
No one else will act for her," confirmed the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the Court decided that Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers would be entitled to speak at the time of the initiation of the proceedings.
The Manager's Revolution or the End of Economic Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence was unnecessary...
For more than ten years, it has been a reminder of the management of large companies towards employees of companies' access to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is for employees to identify themselves with the "values" set out from the mountain, as it used to be when consumers had to use products derived from the ideas of the head of manufacturing techniques.
By becoming the center of business companies, the marketing revolution compared the market acquisition strategy in the right direction...and when authoritarian efforts to use products, different from customer preferences, return regularly!
A passive employee’s approach can lead to death - dealing demiliation.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only visible parts of a much wider global phenomenon that involves mainly managerial structures.
This demobilisation adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and what is more important, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI "demands active access and predictability from all parties involved (...) and requires employees to be committed which are completely in conflict with the revenue of authoritarian management.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution, which should be aimed at bringing workers to the centre of interest of the company as well as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal public opinion research.
Internal public opinion polls - as a questionnaire submitted to employees of Orange - contribute to the revolution in managerial procedures?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Especially because I've already convinced myself that in the face of a new situation, the structure, after various deviations, will return preferably to what she's always done!
Furthermore, authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases moderately the seriousness of its own failures.
Finally, because most managers have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of high schools for engineers, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For the sake of comfort of thought, they are winning an old behaviorory theory, currently relived by "neutrons" from the United States and widely spread without greater knowledge of scientific institutions and the media.
With the possibility of moving "sic" the involvement of managers, he showed a recent survey of the agency Ipsos on Figaro.fr, which only establishes the managers in their position of mechanical management, which is not suitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution is necessary for the proper functioning of modern businesses, assuming the adoption of a final vision of human behavior.
It consists in the inclusion of a basic perspective in all the objectives and practices of the procedure: for employees, commitments to the company will only be possible if they appear as a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At the present time, this concept of employee motivation is only being conducted in a study Motivative functional analysis.
These studies showed that the evaluation of their businesses on the basis of pre-defined doxes, which enables them, through the image that they speak about the company, to assess what they offer to achieve their life objectives.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, management workers can control, predict and anticipate their "social performances" and introduce their management of human resources "on the right path".
This creates a living ground for the development of solid and effective economic intelligence.
In a speech from Oslo, "just war" Obama earned his praise on the right side.
U.S. law welcomed the speech Barack Obama presented the day before in Oslo, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize holder for 2009 defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives, who first laughed at Obama's award of the prize on 9 October, this time pressed for the President's speech, including Sarah Palin, the former candidates for the Vice-President in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, declared Palin, a museum of the right Republican wing, for the U.S. Today's journal, and added that she herself expressed her "sometimes needed" wars in her memories that were coming out.
Of course, the war is the last thing the Americans would want to do, but it's necessary.
All terrorists need to be kept there, they think.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessor George W. Bush, on Thursday in Oslo, justified the deployment of forces and used an expression to explain his decision to send another 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days ago.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, considered that the president took "very good work" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, thank you, the former President of the Snow White House, who particularly appreciated the President's reference to "the existence of evil in the world".
In my own way, I considered this speech to be quite historical, I declared Gingrich during the interview on the radio "The Takeaway".
The former MP, whom some consider to be a potential Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential elections, was thrilled to see the "record president" recalling members of the Nobel Prize committee "that they themselves would not be free and could not transfer the prize for peace if the use of force did not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, former author of George W. Bush's speech, now editor Washington Post, Obama presented a "very American speech".
Not only did he represent himself as a "world citizen" as always, but he "talked as an American president" and reminded Europeans "that they live in a safe bubble that they did not create themselves and that they did not do too much to keep it," Gerson assessed.
A few of the few right-wing dissatisfactions include Bush's Ere, a former ambassador at the UN John Bolton, who marked the expression "one-sided, bold and without inspiration", as stated on the National Review Online website .
On the left of the president, for example, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is afraid of Barack Obama, as he justifies the use of force.
"When we wrap the war into a package of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the medium-sized press remains a favourable opinion for the President.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to consider granting Obama's peace prize as a temporary one, he assessed his performance as an "excellent" and also for a speaker known as his talent.
The talk from Oslo should serve as a guide to international decision-making in the fight against poverty and oppression," the California Journal states.
Obama "received what was needed," assessed the New York Times, and marked "for simple and instructive".
Road hauliers: three marathons to a deal that saves supply for Christmas.
After three marathon negotiations, road transport committees and TLF, the only organisation of employers that remained until the end of Friday evening came to an agreement that ended the call for a state and threat that hung over the supply of Christmas supplies.
The State Secretary for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, at the Friday signing of the agreement, expressed "rejoice" after several talks that began in the middle of the morning.
After the second night of discussion, the negotiators broke up early in the morning, hoping that the text of the agreement would be signed as soon as possible by the end of the morning.
Despite the fact that three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) have resigned from the discussion.
But there was a need for more than six hours of the meeting, which began in 11 hours to allow everyone to agree and in 18 hours to sign the agreement.
This conflict "would hurt businesses a lot" and "it would be dangerous to break the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text includes an increase in wages by 4% in the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% in the highest wages (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest wages is increased from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but there's a lot of effort behind it, explains Patrick Clos (FO).
Tonight, we will give our members an order not to allow lockdowns, no lockdowns of the supply centres.
But there may be a few more opponents who are not satisfied," he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed the "correct agreement", even though it was difficult to recognise the increase in high wages in view of international competition".
According to it, an increase of 170 euros per month for the lowest wages and between 100 and 120 euros for the highest.
It is a healthy agreement and respect for employees, said CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Doine (CFTC) welcomed the "historical agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is an "acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides for a revalidation of travel costs of 3% and a report on the situation of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also focus on the issue of payment 13 and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled "a reduction of EUR 100 million in corporate wages tax" which was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 Budget Bill, which was voted on at night from Thursday to Friday at the National Assembly.
The government is asking the Senate for a "good" vote.
The signature enables this Agreement to apply firstly to enterprises that are members of this organisation, later on to the whole sector, in the case of enlargement of the Ministry of Labour.
It will be accomplished "in the shortest possible time," Bussereau assured.
The whole process can only speed up the disagreement between employers' organisations.
The FNTR organisation is talking about "bad trade" because 100 million euros "have already been offered to the sector in the context of compensation for part of carbon tax".
The State Secretary for Transport has forced us to engage in a necessary conversation, not as a result of a mutual analysis, but because of the fact that he did not breed the weeds during the coming Christmas season, he complained about Unostra.
For the organisation of the Other, it is threatening to see the agreement in the next 12 months "buying a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the field".
Regional trains RER A: suspension of the weekend transport, the committees are not satisfied with the proposals of the RATP transport company.
Interruption of the transport line of urban trains RER A, which is the largest link of urban public transport in France, will continue during the weekend, as Friday's discussions between the committees and the management of RATP on the second day of the event did not lead to any specific results in the question of the premium.
On Saturdays and Sundays, then the important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will only drive between 10 and 20 hours, on the main section (between La Défence and Nation) will drive every other train, except this section only one train from four.
The connection with SNCF will be interrupted at Nanterre Prefecture and passengers will thus be forced to switch to another train.
The business houses of Galeries Lafayette, which expect more than 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP sought to make sure of large business houses".
Link RER A leads from the west to the east of the Paris agglomeration.
The narrowly managed RATP leads from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, there was in operation one train from two and virtually no compound was ever out of the peak as planned.
Like the people of Ile de France on Thursday, the people of Ile de France did not get involved in confusion.
So early in the morning, there were many fewer people than usual at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station, including because of the lack of students and students.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 years old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he was up about "an hour and a half ago to make sure he's in time."
The Saint-Lazare Station has not been completed, the SNCF State Railway has announced, and a larger number of members and officers of the order have been predicted.
The local trains RER A operated SNCF in the direction of or to Cergy-Le-Haut either arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare Station with a metro connection.
Further valid meetings will be held on Saturday and Sundays, on which the results of the Friday afternoon meeting will be assessed by the committees as "weak".
The RER management proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER A trains on all sites, changes in working hours, careers, etc.
However, this is not the case for drivers who demand a prize, according to Thierry Garon (Jih Boards).
In the meantime, RATP has postponed proposals for the premium, which has worsened the CGT by the fact that the management "was unable to solve the problem while in the passenger transport and SNCF it was".
At a new meeting, which is planned on Monday, "the conditions for the performance of the call are reviewed more closely", the transport companies of RATP clarified.
Which was the reason why the experts think the company is "making fun of weekend travelers."
In the morning, about 150 drivers occupied the company committee in its Paris headquarters.
The conduct, which has so far refused any discussion during the event, was therefore decided for the meeting in the interest of "cooling".
The danger is that the conflict will spread on Tuesday, even on the RER B line, after Unsa and the Independent will announce the emergency.
The Committees shall apply for a premium from 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (Jih), Independents (Independent)) and shall be charged to the worsening working conditions on this line, which shall transport millions of passengers daily.
The RER urban train drivers earn from 2200 to 2700 euros gross wages and 600 to 650 euros for irregular working hours and for Sunday work and for holidays.
Turkey's justice has dissolved for the Kurdish side, and this decision is having a serious consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court decided on Friday to abolish the main pro-Kurdish party in the country. This decision immediately triggered protests in the Kurdish community on the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision can significantly complicate the government's task, which seeks to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and thus try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society's party (DTP) has been dissolved because it has become "a ban on activities threatening the independence of the State and its indivisible units," the president of the Supreme Court Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of negotiations.
The decision was unanimously adopted by 11 judges, when the majority-seven votes were needed for the party's dissolution, Kilic stated that 37 parties, including its President Ahmet Turk and Ms Aysely Tugluková, had the right to participate in political life for a period of five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the abolition of the parliamentary immunity that Mr Türk and Mrs Tugluk used and the confiscation of the property of the party to the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP site has 21 chairs in Parliament (of 500).
The leadership of the party has already pointed out before the verdict that Members would rather leave Parliament than act as Members without political competence in it.
The decision is to continue the proceedings initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses DTP of the "commands" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider to be a terrorist organisation.
Many observers are convinced that DTP is a legal political victory of the PKK rebels.
The party ensures that the PKK has no "fundamental connection", but refuses to mark it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict comes at a time when the government gives the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a number of measures to strengthen their rights and tries to limit Kurd's support to the PKK and end such a conflict.
The DTP authorities confirmed that the resolution of the party could lead to a recovery of tension in the south-east of Anatolia, where in recent weeks many demonstrations have been rejected against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan is held in custody with the police.
Since the notification of the justice decision, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large town in the south-east, which is mostly Kurdish.
The police used tear grenades and waterworks, demonstrators threw Molotov's cocktails again, or shot stones from the trenches.
There were about a hundred people in Istanbul, too.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk stated that the decision of justice would only be "deeper despair".
Turkey cannot resolve this question (Kurdów, p. 25) by banning the party, he said in the press.
The government, created by the Islamic movement, also condemned this decision.
We're from the principles against breaking sides.
It's okay, Taner Yildiz, the Energy Minister.
This decision was a direct reflection of the democratic proposals that the government had launched, said Politologist Ahmet Island.
Of course we can wait for the PKK's reaction, added.
On Thursday, the PKK reported on one of the most deadly attacks in northern Turkey, which killed seven soldiers in three days ago.
Snow can come
It's a really cool winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the head of the FES Technical Services Winter Department.
But that's so that his employees can test and learn to control all the train techniques.
It could be the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
It is equipped with over 300 employees and 120 vehicles to take care of snow and ice.
However, the FES is acting in accordance with the exact plan.
As soon as the snow in Frankfurt falls completely and the temperatures fall below zero, they will go to 20 so-called "A" sections, explains Brauburger.
These sections include the main and transit routes such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, urban public transport lines, walking zones and sections with falling like Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, it is necessary for a maximum of three hours to store a wet salt which is better kept, something about 1040 kilometers.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock in the night, "to keep the roads free when the transport starts to work".
It's not easy when it starts snowing at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the Winter Department of Technical Services, "because no one is willing to make a place for the septics."
Only when it's not so snowy are there a number of incoming and connecting communications, which also include Rat-Beil-Strasse.
The last priority is sideways and sideways.
Brauburger knows they're gonna complain.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES pedestrians will be on their way, mainly to clean up dangerous places and crossings.
The FES cannot take care of all cyclists with the majority.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which follows from 22 to 4.30 bridges in particular, says Brauburger.
Since the ice is rapidly formed on them, the temperature will disappear as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees.
If necessary, they will also be called by the police.
Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other massive dinosaurs: The animal was two meters long and 1.50 meters high after two strong rear ends, had a long skull with sharp, swollen teeth, short front endings with slender scratches and long tails.
If this species lived a few million years later, it would be nothing extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt from University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the fourth edition of Science magazine writes that Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body signs.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today’s New Mexico, which was then in the equatorial dry area of the Pangea supercontinent.
Tawa opens a new window for the earlier evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about relationships, enlargement and early dinosaurs.
In 2006 Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging in Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes in one day we found a dozen dinosaur bones, which is unknown to the triassus, a member of the Randall Irmis team from the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones identified scientists quickly as a new species.
During the excavation, the remains were collected with a total of five units.
The findings confirm the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it's an unusual finding: "The fossils of the dinosaurs from the triasis are very rare, most will find only single fragments."
Other dinosaur experts don't share this enthusiasm without any exceptions.
Especially the sensational finding is not, but it confirms some theory about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current scientific opinion, dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the pridinosaur arrangement is mostly controversial.
Experts discuss, for example, when the eagles split into three of the most important development lines: the mass-eating thermopods, which later belonged to the Tyranosaurus rég, Velociroptor, and also the birds, the "long-term" of four soropoids and their relatives, and the beekeepers of Ornithischia (ptacopan) to which the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus belong, for example.
Tawa hallae is the original therapist after analysis of Nesbitta and his colleagues.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, researchers found evidence of airbags that also have the offspring of the terapods of birds.
Thanks to the airbags, the breathing of birds is more effective than the frogs.
At the Tawa hallae, the bones of the five were apparently filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive airbags teropodus, says Randall Irmis.
Since the relative line of huge soropodes also later had airbags and light bones, this useful innovation has probably created a common precedent for both groups.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs living in South America are known to date, scientists have been able to say that the caves first appeared.
According to this, the three development lines were divided early and extended from South America to all the continents that then formed a single earth mass as a supercontinent of Pangea.
She would also talk about the fact that the team found the remains of two others along with Tawa hallae, not especially close relatives.
These three can't come from a common, immigrant ancestor, the scientists argue.
We believe that there have been at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of a scientific study.
There are, of course, differences.
One even older species, Silesaurus, a group of the most difficult dinosaurs, lived in Poland today, says Bonne paleontologist Martin Sander.
His belief could give a painted picture together, because in South America there have remained very many primitive fossils of dinosaurs, and on other continents there are rare times.
As dinosaurs have proved, from the relatively rare sideline of the plazas, they have developed into the ruling rulers of the earth during the Middle Ages, it remains a mystery.
During the trias, dinosaurs shared their living space with many other beaches, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying yachts and countless other yachts.
The collapse at the end of the trias was extended to the whole world and many new species developed, while relatives died and the division of the trias and juries.
The History of Success Has Not Lasted Forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could be mass measurements that dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the beach doesn't.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could push out competition.
The history of success didn't last forever.
About 150 million years later, another group of animals hit the meteorite, which also developed into a trias and lived in the shadow since then.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes Professors University Toronto, University of Cambridge, Viennese University or Berkeley in California.
Students from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, São Paulo, Berlin or Brem joined.
The police clearance of the seized casino of Frankfurt Goethe University took care of the whole world.
278 professors and teachers of Goeth University, but also high schools all over Germany, Europe and North and South America solidarity with Protestant students in Westend campus.
In a statement written by German and English "not approved" by the president of the police force.
Because there were numerous walls and works of art, the university president Werner Müller-Estler allowed the building to be cleaned up, which they occupied last week by attending students and lecturers.
At that time, five students were injured.
Damages, judges signatories, do not justify "violent release of self-organized teaching of students and teaching police officers".
Clearance is an "inacceptable intervention" into freedom of research and science.
The exceptional focus on vandalism is on "injustice and criminalisation of protests" and focuses on content.
The Bureau avoided the necessary discussion.
The rapporteurs call for the suspension of criminal proceedings.
It is claimed that most interns did not support eternal harm.
Rightful protest
Also, the young committee organisation Verdi and the German board association solidarity students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern about its own future, says the Secret Earth Youths of Verdi Alexander Klein.
The Hessen Ministry of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) has so far turned the proceedings of the university president and police.
We're grateful to the university president.
The destruction and storage are totally unacceptable, said on Thursday at the Current Hour in the Wiesbaden Land Snow.
We have an understanding for the protest, but we have no understanding for vandalism, said the MP of the Earth Record for the CDU Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, they saw the opposition SPD, the Greens and the Left.
The CDU takes a painted wall to the front to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and requirements of the students, there was a clearance.
On the left, she submitted a proposal that called on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police situation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was a secret city, not available to visitors from the west.
Greenegrad, one of the ten periods of Moscow’s capital city, in the Soviet Union, was a closely guarded site where a secret military research was carried out.
Today, this period is considered to be 216,000 inhabitants, 37 km from the Moscow centre, for the Russian Silicon Valley.
Major micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centres are located here.
Since September 2008, Green City representatives have been in contact with the Frankfurt scientific centre Riedberg - with the university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There have been several mutual visits and on Wednesday they signed in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg "Protocol on Close Cooperation".
The Russian delegation led the Moscow mayor, Jurij Rosljak, and the Prefect of the Zelenograd Anatoli Smirnov, signed for Frankfurt the lead planning rapporteur Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, FIZ representatives and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in natural science research will go to a seminar in Zelenegrad.
Scientific exchange
This is a temporary scientific exchange.
It's also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to catch up on the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want orders in Germany.
Greenegrad is the home of major Russian research institutions and companies.
Among them are the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the major Sitronics and the Russian Electronics Group.
The period was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for weapons research.
Greenegrad (a literal translation of "Green City") received its name according to the forested hilly landscapes to which the research facilities are planted.
Stuttgart brake
The Stuttgart 21 dimension is not enough to be prepared at all.
For the proponents of the project, it is quite simply a "new heart of Europe".
The S21 is more than the launch of the station, more than a monstrosity building that will throw the main city of Bádenska-Württemberg for one decade into the desperate building chaos.
Stuttgart was born in the spirit of the '80s.
The main railway stations that ended in the city centre were then considered transport-technical fossils of the 19th century, which act as the brakes of modern rail transport, because it took a huge amount of time to cross the locomotives behind the front.
Take a moment to stop, move on, so it should work.
And that's why he's leaving the main station: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the train station, which lies almost half the way of the trans-European railway magistrates between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - that is why the slogan about "the heart of Europe".
It actually starts with S21, although 80-year-old visas are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves knew that the start of the building in the Hessen and Bavarian capital is almost non-financial.
Since the existence of modern navigable trains with motor vehicles and drivers on both ends, the main station has no problem with driving and driving.
However: Stuttgart begins 21 including new routes ICE to Ulma.
It's a renegade and a community policy.
The routes cooperate, even because the risk of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic is borne by a taxpayer and not by a state group.
Urbanists can still apologize for the project in some way.
A new city space will emerge, which - if we trust computer images of designers - will contain a lot of green.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
Transitional station and track construction are designed for personal transport, which - typically in the 1980s - has attributed a huge increase.
There was no competition for cheap flights at the time.
Modern transport policy must go, however, first of all, to strengthen freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than road freight.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains due to a steep climb.
Even more serious is that S21 directly affects many other railway projects.
In Switzerland, a good six billion euros should be buried.
That's an official number.
Experts consider a real ten to 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade there will be a lack of funding for other catch points and narrow spots on the network.
There are 60 larger projects on the Transport Ministry list.
One of the most important is the construction of approximately 180 kilometers of the long road along the Rhine.
Since 1987 the pace has been slowed on this route.
There's a need to push right here.
But S21 will be like a brake.
The trail of the Gulf of Riga will become the backbone of international freight transport: directly in the heart of Europe.
The government is examining the judgment on the airport
The Land Government has left open in the Land of Wiesbaden, if it objects to the judgment of the Hessen Administrative Court (VGH) concerning the prohibition of night flights and is allowed to review it.
Coalic CDU/FDP commissioned experts to legally judge more than 400-page VGH, said the Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
VGH in Kassel today argued in writing that in the event of a construction planned for the north-west border of Frankfurt airport, the state would have to re-adjust the night ban.
The permit of 17 years between 23 and 5 hours, as expected by the Land Government, does not comply with the law for the protection of the population from night noise.
The coalitions shall be decided by 4 January if they require a review of the judgment.
The opposition criticised this postponement and appealed to the representative of the government to reject the revision of the Spolko Administrative Court in Lipsk.
The head of the SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel group called for the CDU and FDP to return to the promises regarding the ban of night flights that she made before the election. Otherwise, it is possible to evaluate it as "a violation of the word".
It's damn hard if you can keep your word, Chief of Green Tarek Al-Wazir said in violation of the FDP "We hold the word".
Minister Posch refused Schäfer-Gümbel's election, the Land government is trying to get to its night flights through "transgression of rights and tricks".
Accurate legal control takes time.
Coalition doesn't want to work on "fast first impression".
We need realistic decisions, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
The years of his fraction to ban night flying have never been the same as the opposition.
United States Banks Payment Assistance
America, the crisis of the Great Banks is getting rid of state power.
The Bank of America paid a loan on average from the Tarp rescue fund of a total of 45 billion dollars (about EUR 30 billion).
According to the report, CNBC plans to pay State aid to Citigroup as well.
This is how the constitution wants to get rid of the restriction that money came to accept - the limitation of the payment of bonuses to managers and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America has made $19 billion available to investors through variable bonds.
The balance of the amount was taken from its deposit, which was filled out, inter alia, through the sales of the committee.
The bank manager, Kenneth Lewis, thanked the US taxpayer on Wednesday night: Money injections helped us to overcome a difficult time.
The monetary institution has damaged its financial crisis by taking over Merrill Lynch's investment bank.
Citigroup wants to get rid of its obligations to the State by also making money on the capital market.
The CNBC informed the source that this US bank could already announce a capital increase of about $20 billion on Thursday.
The spokesperson Citigroup didn't want to talk about it.
In June, they paid for the aid already Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick Select
It just went faster than expected.
The station presented the successor only two weeks after the ZDF's Board of Directors expelled Nikolaus Brender from office.
Last night, the crimson wanted to agree on that person.
Peter Frey, the head of the ZDF in the capital of Berlin, was named for the favorite.
But the station didn't confirm it - officially, to prevent the process.
However, the role could also be played by the fact that they did not want to damage the SDF's agent Markus Schächter, if this proposal did not go through with the board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the jury.
The result of the vote was unknown before the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, he cut off Schächter's board of directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Brender's loss of mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächther, although she was expected.
The majority of the Union in the Governing Council had already signaled several weeks before the elections that it did not want to confirm Brender in the office.
Hesen Prime Minister Roland Koch organized the opposition to the chief editor.
He refused further suspensions in the Office of the High Chief of Staff on the grounds that, for Brender, the monitoring of the FDF's reporting quota had been reduced.
Until shortly before the election, therefore, protests were strongly criticised for the political influence of the ZDF.
Finally, there were even 35 state legislators involved in the debate, who are the Koch's anti-constitutional assessment process.
It wasn't about anything.
About person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy, and romance.
Then he worked for Southwest and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey went to ZDF, first to the "heute-journal".
Next station: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur; 1991/92 writer in Washington; until 1998 leader and moderator "Mörgenmagazines"; until 2001 head of the ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF main study.
After Brender, who was elected on Wednesday by the media magazine magazine of the year, was seized, the Greens announced that they filed a constitutional complaint.
Love's opposition to the Governing Council, Rynko-Falk Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the countries of the country should change the state agreement with the ZDF so that the personal proposals of the intent could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also refused to exclude the foreign policies from the ZDF Supervisory Board.
Brender's alleged successor Peter Frey advised the board of directors with a smart chess tahm - immediately after Brender's meeting, he criticized him strongly for it.
As a result of this evidence of journalistic independence, he could nominate him instead of the chief editor without losing face like Schächter, so he could be elected by the board without becoming suspicious that the party would be pushed to the office.
In foreign arithmetic, Frey is so many of the left-wing liberals.
The study is free of harampadi
Part success for students: After the year of the event, the Ministers of Culture finally joined the Scolk countries on Thursday: at the Conference of Ministers of Culture and Higher Education, both parties agreed that it was their intention to improve the study conditions for baccalators and magistrates.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the burden of testing: Essentially, each study module should end with one test.
In addition, the workload of students should be monitored and "real and protective measures" should be guaranteed.
Politicians and high schools want to simplify the recognition of exams between high schools in Germany and abroad.
Scolk countries undertake to create a more flexible common structural task for the baccalary and master study sectors.
Earth's deviations should cease to exist.
Less Tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, ministers of culture and university rectors have had word round in their mouths about a better study.
They are now filled with specific content for the first time.
The so-called accreditation board found that the number of tests is somewhat drastic: "Every module will be just finished by one test", says the 30-page report, which is intended to regulate, in part, the approval of the study sectors.
"A much lower test load," said Reinhold Grimm, the President of the Accreditation Board, "is to be halted by a misdevelopment that significantly limited the scope of the study."
To that end, the future "deciding criteria" should be "researched" in implementation.
Modules and contents "must be over-checked" to "not necessarily limit students in choice
Seminars."
Students would have a "space addiction that enables and supports their own initiative".
The rules are to be applied when approving new study areas, after examination, but also for existing study areas.
You need to "recredit" every five years – however, it means that it will take until 2015 before all the study sectors are over-controlled.
It is the responsibility of ten accreditation agencies, all over Germany, which are subject to accreditation boards set up by the social partners.
In October, the Ministers of Culture called on the "great" slum countries to act on the agencies so that the full education was not too large and the test regime was not strict.
In each country, universities and colleges have already agreed with the local ministries on appropriate measures.
As a single country has so far pledged additional resources for further development of the Bologna Process.
From the money, high schools should primarily build consultation programmes and study advice, and strengthen experimental and foreign authorities.
This is what countries and high schools want to spend ten million euros on.
At the beginning of 2010, he wants to introduce a new law to parliament.
According to it, only one test should be required for completion of the study module.
Study training should be even more flexible, it should guarantee recognition of tests from other high schools and facilitate the access of the master.
By the end of the following year, the ownership of all study areas in the country should be monitored.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again agreed on study conditions in the country.
The criticism of the resolution was also accompanied by praise.
Juso's High School Group representatives called for the creation of education policy not to be played in the future by the "closed doors" of ministers and university directors.
At the latest after the event, "at least word should be spoken" also students as individuals.
The future academics also received support from the President of the Conference of High School Rectors (HRK), Margrety Wintermantel: "We need student experience," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture, which was discussed by HRK on a joint reform report.
According to the Committees on Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolution did not go far enough: they require a legal claim that would allow each graduate with a baccalary title to have access to a building master's study.
Secondly, the Polish countries must ensure that for today's generation of students, the Bavarian districts will have enough seats available tomorrow in the master's studios with the best study conditions, a member of GEW Andreas Keller's board said.
The country of origin must employ far more speakers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express their free access to the Master's programmes.
More than a note under the spell to Hert Müller
Getting to Germany and out is nice, almost no control..." is the opening line of a poem by Werner Söllner, who, in this torn-out piece of language, thematicizes the experience with the presence of a dissident who has gained freedom, but also has come about his language environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Banát, working first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a lecturer of one of the children's bookstores, then moved to Frankfurt nad Mohan in 1982.
Söllner was awarded various literary awards, in 1993 he taught poetry at the legendary Frankfurt Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hesen Literature Forum in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He took care of a significant microliterate explosion last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, where he was about "German literature in Romania in mirror and broken mirror of its security acts".
Apparently defeated and infected Söllner left a statement in which Romanian German writers Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer admitted to cooperation as a secret informant of the Romanian Secret Service Security.
Together with some of the present, Söllner won the German language price in 1989.
The recruitment attempts were launched in an unimaginable manner, first in 1971.
I'm, Söllner went on, "then someone who didn't resist enough attempts to threaten the security."
Ambassador Werner Söllner is secret agent Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize for Herze Müller and her unparalleled literary arrangement with the mechanisms of the dictatorial government is a literary scene, and especially the community of German authors from Romania, is struck by a case that denotes the depth and disgrace of the political system, which is based on control and speculation.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if it can be said according to today's state of knowledge, only the perpetrator, but it's also a victim.
In the Acts of Security, secret agent Walter played a role, said after Söllner's confession, Michael Markel, and referred to the positive influence of secret agent Walter.
"He was cutting me off at all the points for him," says Markel.
He has a moral obligation to make this note.
Söllner's statement was in this form and was unexpected to this audience, but it is not entirely surprising that the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service are recognized.
Herta Müller wrote already in July when she read her own file, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for mirror safety.
Touching, you can assume, they'll speculate and in some cases even know what name is hidden behind the cover name Sorin, Voic and also Walter.
Unlike in the Dutch, by the way, a very certain look at the ingredients of the Stazi, manipulation with the rest of the security control is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic lighting has been planned and limited.
One of the Birthler authorities, which corresponds to the National Council for the Processing of Safety Components (CNSAS), was established only in 1999, the issue of an act has been carried out more slowly since that time.
Only since 2005, there is a law governing the management of the files.
The fact that the former members of Security still have a great influence in Romania, after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Hert Müller, gave a discussion in which one of the former Chiefs of Security from Temesvár expressed his refusal to accept the award.
He's got a psychosis, and she's been interrogated only once.
The subjugation of power was expressed here completely in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, in the case of Söllner, as in the case of a silent offence, there are inevitable questions.
The special reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession is to expect that the continuation of this chapter will determine more thirst for knowledge than after the dedication of the wine and the study.
To the genius of Herty Müller, who accepted the Nobel Prize yesterday, it's more than a note under the spell.
Filled deposit Champions League
It seemed as if a purely dressed trade representative came from a delicious Christmas party on which the manufacturer of the sport goods of sweetness was distributing, when he was a quarter hour after midnight in the invited class C Mercedes, the new coach VfBr Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange colored bag of sponsors.
A man with a brandy danced for him to let him go to another town.
Otherwise, he could drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and a 55 - year - old man was lucky too.
It was a good night, but tomorrow he'll be on his way to work.
Or it's just starting.
The words only three days of Switzerland's engagement: "We've reached the eight finals," which in the Champions League thanks to the win3:1 over the Uniera Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be overcome by success: it will be a brutally hard fight against resignation."
"A far more important task" stands before us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance of the royal class in Mohuči on ordinary days.
And prevent the repeated obvious weaknesses after three quick peaks of Maricy (5), Träsche (8.) and Pogrebnyaka (11).
Disposal
The Champions League will be released on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy of Babbel's renegade will be preserved.
Not only did the alleged doctor who added to the non-Suttgart professionals during a short time of self-consciousness, a willingness to set up and joy from the game.
I went to the players and told them that they were supposed to focus on their strengths and I urged them to be more courageous, explained the doctor of the soul Gross so easily a successful recipe, which, however, did not prove any effectiveness as a therapist of Babbel.
He blew up some magic, admitted Babbel's friend Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in the football, things happen sometimes that you don't consider possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after several weeks of being injured, immediately became the best player in the game, tried to describe the detected "phenomene" with the word "fresh wind" and the work of the new super-man: "He is a man who is radical and requires discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
It's obviously missing Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, warns sports president Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart needs more stamina.
As Gross, the players and managers do not want to overestimate the victory against the weakened replacement and completely overrun defense of the Romanian guest.
They would also win in Glasgow before a severe awakening after defeat 0:4 in Leverkus, Khedira thinks.
And sports president Horst Heldt recalled that while one goal has been achieved in the season, the other is still far away.
We're not water yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after his first home victory after three months, it was due to weekend events that took a fresh life in the form of a television interview with the salesman Jens Lehmann just before the start of the match.
It's a decision that makes other people and not Jens, that Heldt put on a tough Lehman's criticism.
He preceded the performance of a poor manager and decided to change coaches after the pressure of puberty fans.
And that he was canceled his day off after the fight, Lehmann marked as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and addiction.
Lehman's statements "formulates pure selfishness", Heltt explained and announced the consequences for the marketers.
Both of the four will have no more joy in life.
In any case, they are at the same time with others that, without the work of a trained coach team, it would not be possible to have such playful and combatlike performances.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great contribution to success," says Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and the man agrees with the igelite bag.
Fighting the World’s Championships
A Historic duel in Bern: The summonser Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of the world's champion Vitalie Click.
After twelve hard wheels, however, the Ukrainian defended his title in a heavy weight of the WBC boxing organization.
The verdict was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitalij Click remains a world champion in a heavy weight box.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated Bern American Kevin Johnson unanimously on Saturday night (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Click this is the third successful title protection after his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was the world's champion of WBO and WBC twice.
Unfortunately, it didn't happen that everyone was expecting.
The click improved its balance on 39 wins in 41 professional matches, twice as a result of injury.
The challenger Johnson was first defeated in the 24th.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Bernese arena drove 2,02 meters high Click struggle with their leftmost.
About 11 centimeters smaller Johnson, who announced before the duel the end of Klík's era, but came before the impact of the world's master, so Kliko couldn't set the decisive impact on his dangerous line.
In all this, passive Johnson made the challenger a little bit, and he was just trying to get to the next round.
The call, however, provoked words and gestures, but the world's champion of trefils only a few times.
But even so, it's just the second boxer after Tim Hoffmann in 2000, who fought with Klík with 12 rounds.
The challenger took care of himself before the battle in the Swiss capital for a riot.
He attacked the Click as a "responsive zombie" that "can't do anything right".
During his assessment on Friday, the champion let himself be provoked, pulled Johnson out of the nose of the sunglasses, "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth win after Click return
The call remained unbeatable after the fourth battle after its return on 11 October 2008.
After nearly four years, he defeated in Berlin, Nigeria, Samuel Peter, and took back his WBC belt, which had to be delivered without a fight.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Areola from the United States in September.
In this battle I got only one wound and physically I was in good shape, motivated the click quickly to return to the ring.
But his dream remains the protection of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of WBO and IBF.
But the WBA breed carries Brit David Haye, after sitting on the throne of 2,13 metres high Nikolai Vulajev in November.
Haye refused in summer a fight against the Click, which was planned for September.
His promotional company is allegedly planning a fight against the Click in the London Wembley Stadium.
Kundúz case
The main attack from the opposition: Chief of the Greens Jürgen Trittin Group pointed out the wrong information about the Kundúz affair as the minister of defence of Guttenberg for the lie.
SPD and Linke (Levice) invite the office to provide an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest knowledge of Kundúz's arrival, the opposition believes that the defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has been allowed to be deliberately misled.
The minister for the deadly bombing of two tanks in September said "consciously not true," said the head of the Green Jürgen Trittin Group in the Saturday news series ARD "Tagesschau".
Let's call it the usual term: Lhal.
The order for the killing was issued in violation of the International Security Support Force rules in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the basis of the message that NATO had read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday, it appeared that the attack was not just about the destruction of stolen cargo cars, but about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
In the United States, which the German commander Kundúzu, Colonel Klein, requested, the NATO investigation has found that up to 142 people are killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left called on Angel Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to express themselves immediately in front of the Spolka dream and also to explain what Guttenberg really knew about this event.
Mrs Merkel has to explain whether it is a strategy for the targeted killing of parts of the Afghan policy in the Spolko dream - and whether the Office of the Chancellor, Bundeswehr and the intelligence service approved this new strategy, called for Jürgen Trittin and colleagues from Green Renate Kunastová.
The speech governments Ulrich Wilhelm definitely rejected criticism.
The Office of the Office has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, too, there was a raise on the question of the Ministry's position on the background of the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs were informed correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the tanks.
Officially it was announced that they should deny the existence of NATO reports and shut down the Minister's sensitive details.
However, from both top officials, it was reported that the Ministry of Defence had even pointed out a number of reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
Frankfurter Allgemeineer Sonntagszeitung reports that Wichert should have requested in the meantime in a letter explaining the situation.
It has been noted that he has not received any response so far.
On Saturday, the Ministry did not comment on the issues and pointed out that this would be addressed in the Spolko Snomba investigation committee, which will provide for the next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see in the awake state of the image and hear voices that others do not see and do not hear.
Not only mentally ill or drug addicts cross the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as it comes to sleep, it's all right.
If we are close to the eyes of our dark room, we must be surrounded by the wildest ideas and fantasies.
However, those who experience the awakening of a dream, seeing and hearing things that others do not see and hear, pay most in the Western world for folly or drug addiction, or at least as a miracle.
However, such images and voices are not limited to mentally ill or drug addicts.
Wine has our imagination: the same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint images or write novels, here and there, make sure they cross the border between dream, imagination and reality.
Dreams of a changed state of consciousness can occur in the most diverse forms, in the best case we call them visions, in worse error.
Although the initiator and effect may vary, however, the vision of mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet New-Age Carlos Castanedy, the shaman state of bloating, psychosis and hallucinations can be derived from similar processes.
Hallucination or vision will occur if the balance of neuronal brain transmitters - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and misunderstandings occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravitation doesn't have much to do with it.
The connection between madness and sleep has been between philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of sleep in awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, found in 1861 "a great similarity of sweating with dream states", for Sigmund Freuda was a dream even "psycho, with all nonsense, superstitions, false meanings".
It's autumn 2001, Henning T. changes in comics.
His body is two-dimensional and crickety.
Gravitation over him has no power, he behaves at the ceiling of the room.
It's a feeling of excitement.
He's surrounded by bloody red crimson figures, priced teeth.
They hunt him, dig into him with heavy fire boots, throw him over the wall, feel pain all over the body.
Loudness, bad voices are threatened by walls and radio.
He can no longer bear the voices that give him and insult him.
Henning T. will pull two cables out of the steroid, take them into the loop and tie them to the hook on the ceiling.
He's going to stand on one of the speakers and he's going around his neck.
Jumper.
Swim's on it.
Learn, the congregation's voices are blowing his drums, "Go to the clinic and get treated!"
Today is Henning T. 40 years old, experienced six acute psychos, last two years, first almost 20 years ago.
They were released by LSD.
His diagnosis is a schizophrenia-efficient paranoid psychosis, besides maniodepressive, taking drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
I've experienced the worst fear and the deepest doubts in my psychology, he says.
The ghosts are a terrible reality.
Approximately one percent of people are sick at least once for the life of schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it is the second most commonly treated disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, disability cannot be distinguished by the majority of the internal and external world, resulting in a confused state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions or the illusion of persecution.
Especially extended is hearing voices - voices that order, comment or lead dialogues.
Not even optical hallucinations are unusual.
The disabled is unable to distinguish the important from the minor, the brain cannot filter the destructive signals, the consciousness is flooded.
Just as a dream opens up a psychosis, she has built a flood of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest kinds of consciousness.
The perception of the reality of psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the clinic of general psychiatric clinics in Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is located in the center of action, everything is important to him.
At the same time it becomes a passive role, it becomes, like in a dream, overpowered by events and cannot be actively formed.
Schizophrenia is therefore often threatened, controlled and manipulated.
The comparison with reality is not possible in most of them, the ghosts are terrible reality, the awakening is excluded.
Once a lifetime of hallucinations
Unlike sleep, says Fuchss, "but there remains a meaningful and spatial structure of the reality that a person perceives in psychosis, essentially maintained."
Bloody thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, to cut out the experience is in the real frame.
The scientist is still standing in front of the argument why our brain is making such a move.
Exceptional conditions can lead to the short-term loss of a relationship to reality, says Fuchs.
Not everyone will turn into a psychosis.
There seems to be genetic dispositions to schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists are based on the fact that the affected person has minimal brain damage.
In the early stages of development, we believe that damage to the neuronal brain damage, such as the viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, is explained by Fuchs.
But there's still a dispute as to how there's a breakdown in the neuronal system, which hasn't appeared in years.
Roles also have an impact on the environment - stress or traumatic experiences can be a psychotic initiator if they are available.
The hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brains go wrong
It's crazy that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, swallow expensive drugs, and others give money for drugs to get them, says Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
If we view overcrowding as pleasant or unpleasant, it is often just a question.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and superstitions for ten years, in last year he interpreted his findings in the book "Die Ireale World in our Kopf" (The Unreal World in Our Head).
Hallucination, however, belongs to the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also to a surprising number of other diseases.
In addition to psychiatric disorders such as borderline personality or depression, diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma are also common.
It is surprisingly hallucinating under certain conditions and the brain itself of a healthy person.
Hallucination, according to Kasten, consists of the contents of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They notice when parts of the brain, in which sense perception is processed, are too active or slightly depressed; if our brain is ingested, or if it is not stimulated.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But there are also incentives, stress, concerns with love or other exceptional states.
In recent studies, up to a third of those who have been asked have experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Prédní Pomrāńska and going to the darkest gymnasium.
Actually, it's a perfectly normal girl.
If it weren't for those pictures and voices.
It can happen that she's talking about a break with long, dark hair.
When he answers, the co-workers look at her with surprise - no one else sees her and doesn't hear this boy.
This silly girl thinks she's asleep, but Sarah K. doesn't, she knows.
He's up, he hears and he sees the boy, just like he hears and he sees sitting a girl next to him in the alley.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, the boy likes it.
I'm crazy, she sometimes asks.
But he knows that this boy and other freaks aren't real and he's gonna disappear again.
In the night, the appearances are more striking
Often, overcrowding is a burden.
When he sits in the classroom, he cannot follow the teaching for how many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just a new companion, but he explains to all the others, hearing and visible on the chart of the mathematical equation.
In the night, the sights are more consonant.
When waiting in his dark room for a sleep that comes slowly and too late, he cannot often tell whether he is awake or if he is already asleep, whether the images he sees, the crimson, or the girl with bleeding sharp wounds on her hands and legs come out in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at those figures.
He doesn't tell his parents and friends about it, they'd think she was crazy.
In 2009, Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
Vloni has graduated and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she was contacted by a psychologist on the Internet, Kasten knows exactly that she didn't get crazy.
Overcrowding is also the art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or has stimulants taken, he will be very likely to be hallucinating, says Kasten.
I don't think the brain has enough work then and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single girl, was like a little girl afraid of other children, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she's been calling her father since she thought she was not her own father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas that also process real perceptions and sounds, it is difficult for those affected by Sarah K. to distinguish error and reality from themselves. "Every experience," says Kasten, "is playing in the brain, and reality is also displayed there.
Halucinations are also images that make the brain come up, so it works so real."
Also the night dreams evaluate the Kasten as a form of hallucination.
Hallucination of healthy people is not essentially different from hallucination in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mental health people are able to identify their errors as unrealistic.
Casten therefore advises its patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary capacity.
Border position between sleep and hallucination
In our world too focused on consciousness, the imaginary experience is unfortunately pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor of Heidelberg and Chief Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic Clinics of Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a difficult, painful disease, but it also brings positive, creativity - overcrowding is also art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard examined the so-called oneroid form of experience, a special form of altered consciousness to sleep.
Oneuroid strains are highly complex, detailed fictitious substances that they consider to be real and do not even distinguish them again from awake state.
Oneuroid consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, such as patients with polyradicular inflammation who experience full motor protection.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, perhaps a permanent, complete inability to move, he replaces life threatening the real situation with his own, imaginary world that is connected to reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
Type of borderline between sleep and hallucination.
Since reality is not possible to deal with a situation, world change comes, but the real situation is present.
The intensive form of support for the meanings and the transfer of meanings in some inalienable situation that enables us to pass through our own ability to form during the moment to the loss of consciousness.
Everything's real, and later in memory.
The historian of art Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneuroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (The Exchange of Hearts) as a rescue action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when after surgery, a heart boy with a subsequent heart transplant gave his attention to several ways, and his body was immediately on the intensive care unit.
Claussen drowned in the world that he created, visited foreign times and places: He becomes an old man lying on a bed, in a train sanatorium, a robot guards his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages between the cultivator, who manufactures fake substances from the blood.
On the engine, the river takes him to its own state, on the hospital bed surfing on the fir in the Alps and meets the Korean mafia.
He's completely immersed in imaginary events, everything's real, even later in memories.
These internal journeys are essentially different from any dream for Claussen.
The dream is different, describing its experience.
In contrast to dreams, memories of these mental journeys are still clear after years and in minor details.
Even clearer and more intense than real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other true experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, they show the oneuroid states, psychosis, hallucinations and drug addictions, as fragile as our inner state of reality is.
Every change in the state of consciousness, says psychologist Kasten, "may lead to deformation of what we call reality."
A reality that can also be enriching.
Snow can come
Burda
In 27 are to take over the burden of children
The new load manager Kallen is a transitional solution: For a long time, Hubert Burda wanted to hand over his business to his two children, said SPIEGEL.
Holding's supposed to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - Humbert Burda is seeing his business in the hands of his children for a long time.
Both children will inherit in 27 years of age and have a strong desire to enter the company, says 69-year-old man SPIEGEL.
We dealt with the details carefully.
The question is, if they're also active in the company, then it's up to you.
And the question is whether they have the ability to do so.
It is not possible to put 7500 employees in charge of their children if they are not able enough.
It would kill both children and business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he was coming from the Presidency of the Representation since January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the Bureau since 1999.
First, he was worried about technology.
Later, she joined the company in responsibility for the property and after Jürgen Todenhöfer's resignation, as well as direct marketing, Cizina, Press and Finance.
For the first time, none of the family members stand in charge.
Burd’s children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Callen's appointment also serves to "overcrowd 10, 15 years," Burd said.
Holding should have 100 percent of the family in the future, says Burda.
In view of the Schickedanz and Schaeffler's case, Burda said that no family business had any certainty before the crash: "It has always happened to companies that have allowed themselves to become obsessed with the capital they speculated about and thought they could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had a dream of world power, says Burd.
I don't feel like a political precept of this country, like Springer, and I don't want to play the world league with "Time", these stores are too big.

Miscellaneous aliases
Christmas is approaching, and it's a time to find out what the celebrities are wearing, and to adapt to it and to their celebration dress.
The face of the cut is very important to highlight the figure, which is necessary to be aware.
Let's make a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an extravagance and a very complicated cut.
Endesa to Barcelona, with electric car
Endesa's energy company, together with Barcelona's consultants, founded the 'LIVE Office'.
This is a project for the development and promotion of electric cars in the capital of Catalonia.
The LIVE' office (Logistics for the introduction of electric cars) will establish and manage a roadmap for the introduction of electric cars in the city and ensure agreements in the field of mobility, will set up, coordinate and submit grants, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electric cars, collect opinions and results of activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, it is intended to support this means of transport for the future.
3 'Electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city involved in the project of introducing electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville will join the project as well.
These are three cities that have chosen the government under the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric cars.
The Energy Company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The aim is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan autonomous area.
This includes energy-related activities and, above all, energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative with the participation of Endesy in the promotion of electric cars.
The company is represented in European standardisation teams and actively carries out a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts quiet periods in the car industry.
The president of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the main export sector of the state, is waiting for "a calm period".
In the economic report of the President of the Government for 2009 Zapatero took stock of the measures taken during the year to support the car sector.
"Without the Competition Plan for the automotive sector, we would be waiting today for a state of abandonment, closure of some of our main manufacturing companies," said the president of the government.
"Thanks to this plan and the wish to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of peace in this industry, which is our main export sector, is foreseen in the future," he added.
In this regard, he argued that the competitive plan, which forms part of the Integrated Car Sectoral Plan (PIA), had set 800 million for projects by 19 producers and 137 aid firms, which had mobilised investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The president explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernisation of production and current processes.
Zapatero also highlighted government measures to support the demand and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is being implemented in cooperation with autonomous areas and car brands.
According to the President, this plan has reduced the average emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by 6% and has provided a "significant increase" of registrations, namely in November of "40%".
20.000 square metres of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first International Classic Vehicle salon will be opened, which is a space for meeting professionals and amateurs from the engine world.
This initiative will take place on 5-7 February 2010 at the Madrid Casa de Campo Glass pavilion.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 square metres, to which more than 200 foreign and foreign exhibitors will be represented.
You will find not only classic motorcycles and cars here, but also in ClassicAuto Madrid products of all kinds related to the world of motors.
The exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classical engines, real drawers for collectors and explorers.
The following will be included among participating companies:Classicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, car sales; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and renewal; or Cochera Classics, specialized Mercedes Benz.
Exterior eligibility tests
In addition, the commercial activity of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: concerting, sports performances, testing, presentations and competitions.
Tests will also be carried out on the ability of classic cars and motorcycles in a custom circle outside the exhibition zone.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Sports-style conservation
The Mazda intends to show that environmental safety has no negative impact on the sport style.
And that's why Mazda3 has a built-in engine stop and start system - also baptized as-Stop-, which is a device that is currently available only with a gasoline engine 2.0 150 horses.
This second generationMazda3 is characterized by good characteristics that have been achieved as a whole.
Surface adjustment, vehicle implementation, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, i-stop system...
All these aspects are excellent at Mazda3.
The front seats of the driver have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The caller is also extremely nice.
With the help of tools and consoles, we conclude that Mazda continues in Japan's trend in developing a futuristic design with many buttons and controls and a marked red and blue color.
This style partially reminds us of a style that also presents Honda Civic.
So we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, are contrasting with the sharpness of German products and, in particular, more sVolkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to defeat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, you need to mention a large pocket space and regular shapes.
The automatic stop and start-up system is currently available only with a petrol engine for two litres and 150 horsepowers with an ash-accessible manual transmission.
This engine is a real box. It is very soft, marked by a reduced level of noise, its performance and lower consumption.
Although the most desired Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not find so many kilometres per year should not exclude this i-stop with a petrol engine, because it is more comfortable when driving and reducing consumption.
As for equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
For serial equipment, mention should be made of the system of monitoring of the traffic pipes (RVM), which prevents the formation of a dead angle, control of the speed and stability, control of the speed, internal beam sensitive to the light, on-board computer with a large screen, parking controls, individual air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and a wheel from the 17palc slant.
And if the equipment is not sufficient, this version was equippedPack Premium, for the supplement of 1,500 euros: adaptable double-axon and audio BOSE system with CD holder, except for other components.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its category.
It shall specify the quality of the materials used, its operation and the high level of equipment.
And in addition, people who don't find more miles per year can choose this version of i-Stop, which is only with a petrol engine 2.0 and 150 horses.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which makes €21.770 in the implementation of Luxury and €23.270 in the tested version -Sportive-.
At this high price, Mazda3 offers us a great deal of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury 'Première'
L. A. has a red blanket, soft as the hands of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.

Our 'Pe', extravagance as usual, chose dark 'lady'.
Slib PhonePeek
Peek is extremely limited, is only used for viewing mail, without being able to view a certain type of attachments or surfing the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States when his Time magazine viewed it as one of the products of the year.
Seeing her outside is harder, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peak is marked by very low prices and monthly payments, less than half of the amount that is applicable, for example, to the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company started offering two new facilities: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, the other on the basis of the long-term free data services provided, but it is necessary to pay a six-digit amount for Peek.
FonPeek, who was represented yesterday at the Le Web event, is a European version of the invention and at the same time its third change.
It's limited as much as its American counterpart, but it brings a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price is about 12 euros a month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
Traveling people with a smartphone already know what it means to get data services after crossing the borders or to look for a café with WiFi (or Fon connection) so they can watch mail.
The romantic attack at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced long ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but according to my experience, a person would need a doctorate from physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to be able to read a miniature letter.
The European Commission is constantly demanding a reduction in roaming rates so that they can be accessible to the whole of Europe, which still has no cross-border effect.
There is a cause for concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that a device like FonPeek (is interesting that he still has a name for Fon if he has no WiFi) enough this type of tariff means that operators start to think differently and consider various offers that would compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another fine example, offering download of books and other searches on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and payable on purchase, not after months.
And that's exactly what I expect it to happen once in the FonPeek case, it's about the possibility of buying with a permanent approach like Peek has already been introduced in the United States.
Not because I'd like to buy it.
I'll check my phone, thank you.
I expect it because I think it's from the consumer's point of view the best type.
It would be interesting if the tennis system could also be used in the computer.
Color that loves Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first U.S. ladies.
For Barack Obama's return to the U.S. president's office, she chose clothes and coat in this color, and she also chose the same color when she accompanied her at the second most important moment of her life: giving her the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: except that it is a similar color - yellow with three-dimensional effects - in both cases it was a class set - dress, bag and coat of the same substance - decorated with high height or toy.
At first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States decided to go in the footsteps of the Austrian princess and wear similar clothing.
The fabric from which the clothing is made makes both models significantly different.
On the occasion of going to Michelle's office, she used a large corner, in Oslo with a printing press.
Change and additions: green boots with medium high heels, a similar model, but in gold color.
It also carries various parts: this timerdole, previously dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have job problems related to maternity.
Employment discrimination has increased in recent years, especially among women of young age who are planning to have a child.
This is the result of the study 'Purity and career of Spanish women' carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute of Women.
The study involved 9.737 women aged 15 to 75 and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited labour market opportunities due to maternity.
The study stresses that at the beginning of the partnership, there are many differences in the views on the number of children depending on whether they work or not, and also on the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work for part-time or have no stable jobs, start living with a partner before the first child is born and have more children overall.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, partnering and maternity leave, and have fewer offspring.
"Women between 35 and 49 years of age have the first child on average 3.7 years of age from the start of a marriage with a partner. This figure makes 4.1 in the case of women who have spent most of their stable employment and therefore had to postpone the partner marriage and the income of children.
The type of call also has a strong influence on maternity, even though it has a smaller influence on the time of the start of the marriage with the partner," explains Margarita Delgado, who is dedicated to research in CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of the marriage of the offspring is the degree of education.
The research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age when women marry and have their first child.
The differences are also between women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group between 35 and 49, women with basic and higher education gave birth to their first child at 25.1 p.m.
"There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with basic education marry and give birth to the first child even before they find stable employment, while women with secondary or higher education prefer to obtain stable employment before marriage and the birth of the first child," Delgado says.
Diane Kruger's worth it, too.
L'Oréal Paris just added new names to its prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of various products of this brand under the universal password 'Cause I'm behind it'.
The performer 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most unlegitimate actors at international level, is thus added to another famous personalityL'Oréal Paris as for example Linda Evangelist, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spain Penélope Cruz.
Even before her entered this selected actress's club Evangeline Lilly ('Dead') and Freida Pinto ('Millionaire of the Chatter').
The Spanish part of this brand of cosmetics is also represented by significant personalities:Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelical's partner in the Lost).
British fashion prices
The British have a lot to talk about in fashion.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, the former and the present - met at the annual price transfer that took place in London at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one missed the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen the best model of the year.
Poker Manuela Vincenta
Manuel Vicent presents thirty X-rays of writers in 'Esový poker' (Alfaguara, illustration Fernando Vicente) who met with him in his literary life (and in some cases even in the ordinary life).
He does not do so in frightened and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but he is looking for something similar to the core of creative personalities.
The road brings excitement, and Vincent doesn't look at the benefits or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reading benefit, even in repeated reading.
I'm here to give you some insights.
About Albert Camus: "On the pages of this book, I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but it cannot be called the benefit of prejudice, morale without guilt and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and never by intellect, something between powerlessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humour, without meaning as if it were a covering of a knife that almost killed her."
About Graham Green: "Our man has been passionate about this woman for the past thirteen years, the luxury, the pleasure and the entertainment, which is the spiritual destiny for the achievement of heaven by the way of destruction."
About James Joyce: "Tohoto Odyssea published in Paris 1922 Sylvia Beach. This is one of the eight-dimensional peaks in universal literature, which has to be crossed from the north, from which the best horocescs are often created."
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
He said to himself he was the heir to the county shipyard, the other time he was the son of a black crocodile.
In both cases, it was a great dream."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer caught this man's mad scream from the Mnich to bring his message to the night of the 20th century in his literary form, running ahead of himself and calling to the future and speaking straight to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt and prayed, 'God my beloved, make me stop writing as a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "At his grave there were the executions of Spencer's verse: 'After effort the dream will come,/after the storm a quiet port,/after the war of rest,/after the life of death.'
About Virginia Wolf: "He also took his depression into his pockets.
His husband fully agreed to tell him that Edward VII was watching her between the azals or that the birds were singing Greek.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic, whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness."
About Pio Baroje: "What else did Martin Santos go to instead of focusing Joyce on Baroque?
What happened to Bennett other than letting Baroque repair the Faultner's weapon?
What was the matter with Celebrates other than the glory of that man's glory?"
Saved Aggression
Last week, my seven-year-old mother passed through our fourth, in Fuenlabrad, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 years passed by the knee and our dog, a cross saved from a weight of not more than six kilograms, without a single word, two times injured her and severely injured her.
Our frustration is that we see nothing fun in such aggression against a small and defenseless animal that was also on the run.
And to do so, the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she was shot at by these individuals, began to worry about her own safety, because such a demon - possessed man who attacks an animal is able to do the same to women, children, the old man or anyone who is worse than himself.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, on Tuesday, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog's been crying all day.
Of course, we have complained about the closest Commission, but we doubt that it was something, and that we should not raise the question of the horrific question, we find these saved murderers to be a Spanish nation.
Our enthusiasm led us to announce this truth.
We don't understand what's going on with today's youth when he's having trouble with a defenseless animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We don't understand where the right education was divided, respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of helmet
The manufacturer of Michelin tyres, in cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Authority (Fesvial), launched a campaign to support the use of helmets, especially in the case of younger motorists, as both of these entities have reported today.
The aim of this initiative is to highlight the importance of using helmets, as this is the only means to prevent head injury and death in the event of an accident when driving a motorcycle.
Michelin states that this campaign is part of their transport safety commitments, which "means more than designing and producing even safer products", and confirmed that it is trying to fulfil this purpose, in other words, by means of an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to support the use of helmets when driving on a motorcycle, under the password 'To be or not to be', is the first phase when more than 500 motorcycle repairers will be deployed to get to the public's widest awareness.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that transport safety "is a constant problem" of this company, which is a manufacturer of dual-wheel tyres and whose main objective is to continuously increase product safety.
Increased sales of light-duty vehicles
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to recover.
All 9,425 vehicles recorded in November in Spain accounted for an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, the first increase after 22 months of permanent collapse, according to the figures of the parent organisation of Anfac producers and Ganvam sellers.
However, the positive data is better put into quarantine, as November 2008 is a very bad comparison period and meant 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the entry in the last month, the total number of registered vehicles in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous accounting year.
Since January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, including all possible vehicles belonging to the category of light commercial vehicles: personal car derivatives, pick up pipes, supplies, smaller trucks and light trucks/trailers.
And there were no clouds that would damage the demand most, even though they were purchased by private individuals, most of the purchases were made by smaller and medium-sized companies and in 100% of cases it is financing through third parties.
Other factors such as stopping or continuing the bad economic situation should also be added to the restriction resulting from the closure of the source of bank loans.
In this situation, unlike the passenger cars, the purchase support 2000E did not help too much.
In addition to private persons, it is necessary to mention the soybeans operating on the feeder sheet of small and medium-sized enterprises, which intend to buy a light commercial vehicle up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions of not more than 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday from Ganvam again reminded us that special attention should be paid to the management of these vehicles and industrial vehicles (stones and buses).
The association of sellers assumes that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and according to the sales estimates for personal vehicles and 4x4 will decrease by 19%.
Auxiliary hand brake system is already mandatory.
As with the ABS anti-lock system, this will also be done with the management of the stability of the ESP, the auxiliary hand brake systems, all of which will become mandatory equipment for European vehicles.
In fact, it is already part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light-duty vehicles, while others have a deadline for the removal of the deficit, which is February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU are designed to increase the protection of pedestrians, which works in such a way that it can help prevent many hits.
The auxiliary hand brake system increases the pressure on the brakes in the case of emergency, which will detect when the driver turns off.
But he can't always keep this pressure to the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of the Bosch car parts, a third of the drivers with an accident did not send a brake before the impact and half of them did not fully use the brake force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this aid requires the maximum braking system, reduces the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study conducted in the EU alone, if all vehicles were fitted with this type of device, up to 1 100 fatal accidents per year could be avoided.
The reduction of this number will be even more significant, according to the calculations, to prevent one of four accidents with an impact on persons-after the introduction of so-called intelligent hand brake systems.
In this case, the vehicles will be equipped with a system which (by radar or cameras) captures the obstacles and announces them to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help to increase the pressure on the pedal if needed.
If the driver does not react, even if the impactor cannot be prevented, the device shall act as intensive to the brake and reduce the risk of damage to the minimum.
General Motors sets up a plan for Opel until January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, employees of Opel in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April - probably April 8 - as Javier Ortega informed, the American manufacturer notes that it will take more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to ensure that each point of the plan is first approved by the party concerned.
As a result, the final document, which will first be submitted to the employees and then to the government of the individual countries in which the production plant is located, can be issued by delaying the start of 2010.
On the contrary, GM ensures that Saab’s sales decision should be adopted in those days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the US producer to make certain decisions as soon as possible.
GM provides contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wants to get Volvo, but considers the possibility of a Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars acting under the auspices of the Russian Converg Group.
In case it is not possible to agree with any of them, GM could sell some of the assets of Saab Chinese company Baic.
It is still valid to decide to close at the end of the year of Saab unless it is able to sell it.
Drive with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In the development of this excellent model, the engineers from Porsche used Boxster S as the basis and managed to reduce their weight by 80 kg, thus showing only 1.275 kg.
On the basis of the first row, automatic loading of the roof was carried out with manual control, which was reduced by 21 kg; the aluminium door was further used, such as GT3, which means another 15 kg less; the removal of air conditioning, 13; the reduction of the fuel supply from 64 to 54 litres also contributed to the reduction of the weight by another 7 kg; after the installation of the other sports seats of 12 kg, due to the length of the 19palco colloquium five kilograms.
Finally, the removal of the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less and the replacement of the door arrests with textile arrests means another kilograms.
It is also offered with a two-way PDK transmission, one vehicle with a hand-made six-step gearbox was tested, mainly on the second-class roads in California, on the mountain sections with many complex stops.
His conduct can only be qualified as untraceable.
The weight reduction does not mean that the vehicle to the asphalt is not printed.
On the contrary: we have not been testing for so long a small and lightweight model that at the same time would pass such security while moving in motion, even at high speeds.
It's a small athlete able to warm muscles in a short drive after a necessary time, until we order him a sprint, braking, and re-use of the engine...
Whatever we want, thanks to the procedure that's as communicative as accurate, whatever we're doing with our hands on the wheel, it's what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical accuracy.
Engine sound according to will
The V6 boxer sound, with 320 horses (about 10 more than Boxster S) is very powerful and it is possible to enable it to 'sport' and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine that was already used in Panama.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether during sowing or recovery.
The locks are solid, but not hard or uncomfortable.
Asphalt the roads we're traveling with Boxster Spyder was pretty ruined, but the car managed well.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; however, in some tracks we found light on the cold and crack even in the early morning.
Definitely this ultralight car is one of the most fun on the market, as it's about something more than just modifying Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010 for a price of EUR 70,831.
'Bang Girl'
Friends Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon series and the occasional 'starlette' on the ' firm' previews, the singer presents her face of the bad girl as vividly as her channel cables.
More than Bad Girl or It Girl, it's Bad Girl.
The Basques have given their victory in Israel
The work was awarded a brilliant victory in 82-91 at its complex Maccabi Electra venue, despite numerous absences in the Duska Ivanovice company, and this led to its group after Mirja Teletovice's great performance, which with eight triple points was the best statement in the company (29 ratings).
Vitorie has succeeded in replacing the significant absence of Herrmann, Olesona, Huertase or Micova with a large dose of placement and collective work, although it had to endure to the end to win.
In addition, a great deal of accuracy from the circle with 16 triple points participated in the final triumph.
The attack began in front of the blues who had been put on the mark from the start.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were far away, already indicating that they attacked the Israelite society very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooter 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Albanian company decided for the internal game Baraca and Elijah’s work, which was accepted by sand and dust upon return to its original place of business to increase the benefit before the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already started to appear as the best in his 13-point company, although 'without six' in the Splitter assessment already indicated that it would not be the best evening for Brazil.
But although the match was sharp until the break, it was not decided in the least and the Maccabees wanted to remind Vitoria that not everyone wins on their games, and 'by the hand of Elias' they managed to win.
Eidson and Pnini have certainly contributed to the return to the launch (50-49).
More inappropriate
The Ivanovic members, the injury, but not dead at all, needed a few exact games to pick up their breath, and then came the Mirza Teletovic tower, which, by three-thirds of them, returned the scores to a calming number (54-67), reaching locals at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Alašti sedéljes skin in the last part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not be allowed to be prepared for the merit results of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their masculineity, did not give up and tried to keep the company alive from the line of three points (70-77).
In spite of this and with Splitter excluded from the Faul seIvanovic and defended well, and while the Israelites were approaching the final minute (80-85), the match had already won and Tel Aviv lost first in the season.
Injuries prevent Unicia from fighting
Unika lost significantly in Greece with Olympiacos and left it the leadership of Group B in Eurolise in a battle marked by three attacks by Unikaja, but above all an internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which made Greek victory easier.
Malagasy did not interfere with the environment of Pavilion peace and friendship, perhaps one of the sicker in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to sleep. Aggressive defense and three thirds of their own, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillema Rubia, sparkled the scene with 12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicija , although the local arsenal in the internal game with Bourousis, Vujcice and Schortsanitis , surrounded the score 22-20, a minute 13, which was the moment when the battle between the opponents of the USABeverley and Williams meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek company began to function and demonstrated its superiority in both zones, where the absence of an English beer due to the injury of Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez made it difficult for the union of Unicija
Between internal players and Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas with three points increased the advantage to 44-32, minutes 19.
Absence of withdrawal
The third part was very influential on the part of Olympiacos, who, despite his loss of 19, proved to be superior and even managed to balance the difference from the struggle in Malaga 66-48, a minute 27 that was wasted by the leadership of the group.
Unika tried to overcome the absence and the last absence of the Scottish beer Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last battle.
Despite all the disadvantages of Unika's leadership and three points of Cook and the benefit of Levise left a certain hope for victory 66-57, minutes 31.
But it was practically impossible, because Olympiacos, thanks to the reinforcement and the transfer in centimeters in his zone, proved that it was unstoppable.
Croatia's brewer Nikola Vujcic, managed to equalize basket average 81-62, minutes 37, and Unicaja took the lead in Olympiacos.
How much should you spend for your profile on Facebook?
Facebook users can get acquainted with the payment that they deserve for their profile, thanks to the new Trovit application, the search engine with the largest number of classified ads in the area of reality, employment and motor vehicles in Spain.
Tool How much should you take? calculates user payments based on more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, using a form that is available on Facebook, where you need to insert professions, years of experience, age and city where the interested person wants to work.
During the week that the application works, the searcher found that the Spanish worker generally feels "badly rewarded", explained in his report Albert Rivera responsible for Trovit.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the worst paid.
The British programmer takes 45.226 euros a year and French 31.059, while Spain receives 24,000.
The driver also has a fee of 34,247 euros per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, in Spain, the highest paid job is a waiter with 11,592 euros per year; followed by a seller with 14,725 euros and a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are drivers, half-employees and social workers.
Brazil sets Zelay's departure date
The Brazilian government set a deadline for Manuel Zelayi's execution at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President-in-Office must leave the diplomatic mission by 27 January 2010 at the latest when his mandate is officially terminated.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian Embassy in Honduras City, confirmed for TV Globe that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy where he is hiding since September 21.
"It is known that on 27 January, after the end of his mandate, he must leave and seek other refuges."
The station also quoted the former stateman, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline stated: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the protection of the Brazilian government," Zelaya telephoned.
After the elections on November 29th (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya made sure that it would be held in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, for a week, he tried to find shelter in Brazil.
The operation ended up being disrupted because Zelaya rejected the condition of political asylum, which he was trying to put in place by the "de facto" government, which President Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After days of wine and roses from the past spring, when inflation was a dominant market mood, uncertainty reappeared in the markets, which should not be surprising, because it is already a natural state in the environment where the workers make decisions about the future that they do not exist on their own.
The drug used by central banks to stabilise the market was debt relief by direct asset purchases and indirect liquidity release in the course of close zero so that financial institutions could buy assets to dispose of assets.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have practically ended, and without doubt their irregular liquidity policy, they are starting to throw a little sand into the conflict, as the Spanish central bank has done with its auction last year.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we will participate in the return of the reduction of risk.
The mobility of the stock exchange and the differences in the debt union have again gained points, although they are still very far from normal levels, which they achieved at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialise private risks, which again affected public debt.
Once again, the pressure on quality and the USA, Japan and Germany have become a shelter for the selected investors, extending the differentiation of the eurozone countries towards Germany.
Spain was almost unaffected by this instability, but at that time Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision of the Spanish Kingdom's qualifications.
On the other hand, certain uncertainty is not useless for the silence of moral risk advocates who have once again tried to burden the consciences of those responsible for world economic policy to speed up the destructive consequences of limiting credit to employment, when a new day of gratitude should actually be announced.
However, the situation in Dubai represents a tribal struggle between the emigration of power recovery in emirates, and as for Greece, we have seen it before.
A government that covers the deficit, elections and a new government is taking place.
He did this in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow the euro member countries to not fulfil their obligations.
What makes sense, however, is that Ecofin has given the Greek government the transparency and commitment of its own citizens to common responsibilities when it needs extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are in advance of the transitional risk premium normalisation period, after some surpluses in supported positions would be within the expected period.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase as well as the bonds of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If European differences are reduced and our situation continues to expand, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The importance of Standard & Poor's is only an anecdotes. When our leading indicators force most of the study services to take over their recovery scenarios and review their recovery scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, the Spanish economy has little hope of experiencing the fulfillment of this warning.
Again, it seems to be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the time being, "carefully, friend drivers".

President Iberdola Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to intervene in front of the subcommission of the MPs, where the energy strategy of Spain has been discussed over the next two decades.
After his intervention, followed by the speech of President Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villasecy, Galán submitted several comments on the proposal submitted by the subcommission at the closed door.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs to invest EUR 50,000 million by 2020 and another EUR 60,000 million from this date by 2030, if nuclear plants that are currently in operation are kept.
If this does not happen, the necessary investment will not be 60,000 million but up to 95,000 million.
Iberdrola really believes that in the next decade investments must focus not on increasing production capacity but on distribution networks and international connections
Since 2020, the issue is changing and the performance will have to be increased.
Its offer focuses on gas and coal plants with carbon capture mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this case, it is believed that there is a need for the new 18,000 MW, namely with other "supportable energies".
Galán, who is of opinion, is a woman of the law on a sustainable economy, which has just approved by the government, is in line with the line that the company requested, did not want to leave alive as a royal decree to support the consumption of national coal, which opposes the policy of combating climate change.
According to him, "the clear long-term bet" is in this sense, despite "precise" measures, as President Iberdrol called it.
Whatever the case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must start to take place now, because their maturity is ongoing and a stable tax framework is necessary for their initiation.
Ferrovial winning 'action' Aer Lingus on ten airports
The subsidiary Ferrovial for airport services, Swissport Swissport, will play the role of the preferred Irish airline Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are the most important of them.
The agreement from which the economic deadlines have not yet expired shall be valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, Junta Kastilie-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol on cooperation for the creation of the Centre for the Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures
The association is expected to invest 20 million by 2012, 50% of which is Ferrovial.
One of the objectives of the Centre will be to explore energy efficiency on the roads and airports.
Action seeks its first road in Australia against Hochtifif and Bouygues
The action fights for its first concession on the road in Australia, which is the market where it is already working as an energy and water business.
The building is estimated at 1,700 million Australian dollars (as well as 1,047 million euros).
Its competitors are the French company Bouygues and the German Hochtift.
The tunnel 5 kilometers long in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast has become the closest option for Actiona to settle in this country as a construction and concession road company.
The workshop wants to have a tunnel completed at the end of 2014
After choosing public-private cooperation (PPP according to initial in English) for further development of the project in the trade plan protected by Erns & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the construction and operation of the town.
The tenders are expected to be submitted in May and the expected investment will reach 1,700 million Australian dollars (1,047 million euros) and, in the final phase, three groups with significant presence in European buildings.
A group called Transcity leads Action, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia's largest construction companies and the second with Italy is one of the largest European underground specialists.
Against the Action Group, the Northern Direct is playing with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French building group Bouygues.
The third and last group, which went through the network, has the name LBRJV and is divided into the Australian capital Lightton (subsidiary of the construction company Hochtift, here represented ACS), as well as the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and a prominent company specialising in the civil buildings of Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large buildings and privatisation, but it carries with it a clear difficulty to enter otherwise than through the acquisition of a local construction company.
In addition to the Asian reference, the strategy that was followed by Hochtift or Bilfinger is still an example of Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS received a position on the market through its 30 % share in Hochtift, owner of the quoted Lightton company.
Million assets
The action is based on a geographical area of greatest importance for the sector in which it already has a significant presence through its energy supplier activities and in the trade in settlement.
In addition to other assets, it has the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and runs a group of companies that build and repair the compensation facility in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use common energy for access to building and infrastructure.
The underground road, which is the proponent of the Brisbane Infrastructure Office, with the name Northern Link, is to connect the western road from Toowong with the surrounding route in Kelvin Grove (see map) within 5 kilometres of the tunnel. It is the biggest action to reduce the traffic burden of Brisbane.
The calendar established by the local administration is planning the task for 2010 and the start of work for December next year.
Although this pay-over would be open in the last months of 2014, the complete completion of the work is planned until 2016.
The tunnel began to design in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic myth and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its financing.
Brisbane already offered this order
Australia continues to bring significant profits to Hochtifif because it announced yesterday a government contract estimated at 154 million.
The ACS share of the transmission via its Lightton local branch of the national network of a wide range of optical fibre cables.
This situation enables fast access to the Internet for 400,000 people and provides the work of the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the King George tower building project on 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work should only start and Hochtift closed the sale for 129 million.
In Great Britain, specifically Manchester, will participate with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC has been allocated a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
Through its Alpine branch, FCC has been awarded a tunnel construction of 2.1 kilometres long for the highway in Slovenia worth EUR 64,5 million.
The company received a contract a few days after working to expand the tunnel in Bosruck, Austria, by 130 million.
This way, the Alpine reinforces its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the work is planned at the beginning of 2010 and the period for implementation is 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore got a commercial at Renfe
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services for the last two years by Mrs. Rushmore for approximately three million euros a year, the railway company informed.
The contract contains the possibility of extending for 12 months each year. Ms. Rushmore was selected among the 16 agencies that presented themselves in the competition published by Renfe, of which four were posted to the finale, including TBWA, who was responsible for the creation of advertising for the last three years.
From this moment on, Mrs. Rushmore will take care of the design and production of the campaign.
Craft 63 million for France Télécom for the braking of competition
The regulatory authority for competition in France imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on lFrance Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions that belong to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited the competition of fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programmes with consumers on the border of the regulation.
The French monopoly and the state company have still purchased more than €560 million since 1994 to impose restrictions on its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the competition authority considers France Télécom to have committed a similar offence as in the past, and therefore it has been rescinded.
Trade in applications
On the other hand, the mobile branch of the French company is still a star among other operators and has opened a trade with internet applications to increase revenues that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the beginning, trade with Orange applications will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for entry into other countries such as Spain.
Play in the league Champions brought 476,4 million Madrid and Barche from the beginning
The Masters League has become a source of revenue for these clubs since its creation in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned 476.4 million since then, which makes them the third and fifth most profitable club in competition.
The list says Manchester United.
The list says Manchester United.
Wining the UEFA Masters League does not only bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of revenue for large clubs.
To the extent that the competition divided EUR 5,362,5 million between 105 companies (of which 12 Spanish) who participated in this action since the 1992/1993 season tournament, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have come out of this division very well.
The white club was the third on the continent with the most money he got to participate, and the only one with AC Milan who won three times the main prize.
The Catalan current champion and the last winner of the missing European Cup in 1992 is in the fifth grade.
The list is led by Manchester United and Munich Bayern, two companies that also counted the most money for participation in the previous League of Masters.
And even though she lost both of them with Barç.
On the other hand, Spain is the third country that received the most money through the Champions, although it received the most titles from all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This obvious paradox is explained by a complex procedure in the allocation of the money used by UEFA.
For this financial year, Michel Platini's body is expected to make a profit of 1,090 million for the Champions League.
Of these, UEFA spends 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that took part in the pre-classification cycle (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, the participants received 3.8 million only for their presence, with the exception of the remaining 550,000 euros for each of the participating matches.
There are also prizes for the win (800,000 euros) and for the remistration (400,000 for each company). Osmiffinalists get three million each; eight quarter-finalists 3.3 million.
Each of the last four will get 4 million.
The champion wins 9 million, while the second finalist is 5.2 million.
This is how the club will earn at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million on fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for victory in the European Superintendent in August.
In addition, there are mobile payments of 337,8 million.
This money shall be divided according to the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the principals and has four designated seats.
Last year's champion will receive 40% of the allocated money, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that are played this year.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% Sos
The Nueva Rumas Group yesterday published details of the offer of buying shares, with which it wants to gain a top position between 25% and 29.9% of Sos capital.
This percentage does not oblige the making of a public offer for the purchase (options) of all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumas offers EUR 1,5025 for the shares that she would pay in ten years and for which she would pay the interest for this deposit 1% annually.
Yesterday the Sos shares ended trading at 1.85 euros; therefore, the New Rumas offer of a company rating of 18% below the market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer shall be conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Council.
The Jerez Group provides a period of 15 days for shareholders to notify their interest in selling the stock.
CNMV declared that it had not been informed of the offer, although Ruize Matesses confirmed that it had joined the regulatory authority.
If the purchase was made, the price would be 611.7 million, while the capitalisation of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, the sauce continues to change the structure of its management.
As an attempt to halt the possible bids on the border to buy and settle the costs of his former leaders, the brothers of Jesús and Jaime Salazars, the election of Marie Luisy Jordan was announced as the head of the internal audit.
This decision shall be made by the first woman who holds a high office in the food business.
It's a newly created place that will be subject to the president of the group directly.
And it is not exempt from the controversy, as the company is still subjugated in the legal battle of a alleged move of more than 230 million from the Sos company of Salazar brothers.
In fact, it is not possible to prevent Sos from discovering new transfers of funds in the coming months.
With regard to Salazars' credit, the former members of the National Court of Justice Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) spoke yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the translation of 212 million without knowing the place of their destination.
CNMV allows the option to exclude the Paterna who participated in Inversora Mer
Yesterday, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) approved the exemption of Inversora Mer from Federica Paternin on 9 October.
The supervisory authority has explained that it allows this operation, since it understands that its conditions are in conformity with the applicable standards, and considers that the content of the brochures submitted after the amendments adopted on 2 December is "sufficient".
CNMV made it clear that the offer is directed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federica Paternine at the price of 7.65 euros for the share, representing 8.95% of the company's capital, which is made up of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on stock exchanges in Madrid and Bilbao.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares were neglected, which could not be transferred in any way, until the offer was closed, which it specified that the price was fixed by Federica Paterni in accordance with the rules in force.
New tools for car assessment
In these days storms and accidents not only make car services.
Each day of thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance event is withdrawn to a service where the knowledgeer must estimate the damage and the cost of repair.
No insurance event is the same and the calculation of the cost of the part and time of the workforce may be long and complex work.
Manually calculate repair costs from 20,000 to 30,000 euros including parts and working force can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
For this reason, almost 100% of people use this type of system.
Suppliers of services and solutions for the assessment of insurance events and maintenance shall be responsible for collecting information provided to them by manufacturers to develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audetex is a leading company from the American Solar Group; 80% of the evaluation is carried out with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of instruments for assessing and processing information about the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the producers is not easy at all.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Trade Director Audatex, they work in Spain with 63 producers and importers and each of them provides them with information in another format.
In addition, data for processing are still growing, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been mentioned in the last five years than in the previous 15 years.
Once the new vehicle enters the market, these companies start working.
It's a very hot job, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and set its price.
In addition to each model, "intelligent" graphic processing is carried out, where it is possible to "exploit" individual parts of tourist vehicles.
With regard to the model with mass sales, work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
In the case of a minority car, it may take three or four months. Currently Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
The most exclusive models they have are Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
With regard to the traffic park in the circuit, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the documentation and database work, Audatex has eight centres distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national seat is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There are more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanical experts) working at the same time with three computer monitors.
Auditex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Every month 2.5 million data are classified, and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this immeasurable flow of information allows companies to make different use and provision of different products.
The most frequent use focuses on repair and maintenance, but according to individual countries, there are also tools to manage spare parts or to calculate the sales or residual value of the car.
The only company that has a guide who informs about the value of vehicles used in Spain is Eurotax.
Auditex doesn't offer them in our country, but in the United States, yes.
With a view to the products offered by Auditex, it is easy to get the support that professionals can use in the sector.
This company offers ten different instruments, with AudaPlus as the star product, the standard solution for assessing the insurance events intended for the know-how.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it shall also include time for repair estimated by the manufacturer or by-products.
This instrument shall be applied as applicable for each evaluation.
The highest price is 5.75 euros for customers who use it less, up to 10 times a month.
Then every insurance company that carries out thousands of estimates will negotiate its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow for the complete identification of the vehicle and equipment resulting from the installation line only on the basis of the first transport number.
AudaGlass focuses on the vehicle glass and AudaSubbastas is an open service for the professional sector on the internet, which allows to dispose of vehicles with a total insurance event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analysis or finding deviations by marks or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many models have passed the service due to the accident or how many have suffered serious insurance events for certain periods.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to developing this type of tool.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also intended for knowledge and also provides digital images, access to works or prices and official time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of Einsa based in 1971 as a supplier of services and solutions to the assessment of the damage, accidents or maintenance of cars
Gt Guia evaluation is her reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in services, 3,100 acquaintances and 53 insurance companies.
The turnover grew by 20% per year over the last three years and in 2008 it accounted for EUR 10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization of the installation office in Paris began.
Audetex was born in Germany in 1966 and was established in Spain in 1979.
According to sources, 62% of her brother is born in Europe and 38% in North and South America. She works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 in Spain.
The global invoice of the Solar Group (Audex, Sidex, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company earns EUR 19.1 million, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group became a stock exchange of $1,000 million and now its shares are estimated to be $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been listed at the New York Stock Exchange and included in the Standard & Poor's Reference Index.
Internet sale of unmanned vehicles
Last October, the Solar Group bought Autoonline, an internet base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insurance event.
The operation provided for the registration of EUR 59.5 million of 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended by the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of the purchase was to provide more services with added value to customers with access to the vast international market.
This assessment and purchase and sale service is exclusively handy to professionals in the sector such as insurance, knowledge, credit, services, sales of spare parts and professional sellers who must register before the start of the operation.
This platform was set up in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, of which 500,000 in Germany.
The main markets include Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The web currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 acquaintances.
It manages 3,000 daily advertisements and adds about 100 new advertisements to the Spanish market every day.
According to the Spanish law, the car number of which has been removed cannot be returned to service, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles with historical value may be allowed to operate, even if they have been cut off, after the preliminary procedure.
Budget of the service in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audetex ensures that the user receives the budget only in four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for replacement work, creation of budget generation budget.
The ease of use is a fundamental condition for these systems, especially for the conviction of professionals of a higher age who are more or less resistant to new techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, including tourist 666, 109 terrain, 137 motorcycles, 78 supplies and 44 trucks.
Of course you need a computer to connect to the Internet.
After identification of the model to be corrected, using the number of the trailer, a real graphic display of the model will appear and then the necessary replacement part will be selected.
The user may include variables as the price of the labour force, supplements or discounts, and then print and forward to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an AudaPlus rating tool, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service-oriented and does not include labour estimates.
The cost of using this working tool is 350 euros a year, which the customer can finance.
At present, Audatex is working to make this view three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that the mechanics welcome, because it allows for for example to choose a door and turn it around to see the inside.
