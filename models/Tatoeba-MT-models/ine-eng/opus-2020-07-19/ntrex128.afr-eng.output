Members of the Wally Assembly are worried they're going 'like wet'
There is a consensus among some members of the meeting on the proposal that their title be changed from AM to MWP (for a Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Walloon Parliament.
Members of the political spectrum are afraid that it can trigger a mockery.
One member of the Labour Party says his group is concerned because "it's with Twp and Pwp rhyme."
For readers outside of Wallis: In Wallies it means twp stupidity and pwp means relaxation.
A meeting member of the Plaid Cymru some say the group as a whole is "not happy" and proposed alternative.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party says his group is "acceptable" about the name change, but noted that it is a short speech from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of stupid or stupid.
In this context, the Welsh letter you like the Yorkshire English statement of the letter speaks to you.
The Committee on Meetings, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the amendments, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of what are called Members of the Assembly will, of course, be a matter for the Members themselves."
The Law on the Government of Wallis 2017 gave the Wallish meeting the power to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that received broad support to call the meeting a Wallian Parliament.
With regard to AM's title, the Commission chose Welsh Parliament Members or WMP's, but the MWP option received most approval in a consultation with the public.
AM's seeming to be proposing alternatives, but the struggle to get consensus can be a headache for the president, Elin Jones, who must present a bill of change within weeks.
The law on reforms will also include other changes to the way in which the meeting works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the draft committee system.
AM's last statement will be in the question of what they should be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change their country name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The referendum was organized in an attempt to eliminate a decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has been calling for a long time already to represent the name of its neighbor in the north in his area and has repeatedly made a cap on his applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, George Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, said that he would ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, however, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The clocks of St. Martin's fall silent because churches in Harlem struggle
"Historicly," said the old people I spoke to, "there was a corner and a church was on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"None of the two are there today."
He says that the disappearance of herbs is understandable.
"People socialize today in other ways," he said.
"Kroes are no longer the family rooms where people go regularly."
As for churches, he is concerned that the money from boat sales will not last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they are back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the type of people who will not help the neighborhood’s remaining shelters.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he said, "and that's why the day that closes these churches will bring even closer, because most of the people who enter these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, Saint Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshiped nearby took over the title of the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Eerw. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott from retailers in 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who did not want to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but while Father Johnson’s members planned to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
Eww. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the charilion "the poor people's watches."
The expert who played the charilion in July called it something else: "a cultural box" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carilion in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the larger carilion at the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather says St. Martin's hasn't replaced him.
What has been playing at St. Martin's in the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the laymen of the church, others by the Episcopal archdiocese.
The church cry, the congregation’s governing body, which consists of laymen, wrote to the bishop in July with concern that the bishop “try to pass the cost” to the church cry, although the church cry was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the bishop.
Some members of the congregation complain about a lack of transparency on the part of the church.
Hail injured 13-year-olds on bedside in California
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday and injured him on the first day of the sleepy season in California, officials say.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for a half an hour Saturday when he heard the boy cry for help and then pulled a group closer to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was just the excitement of a first catch, but then he realizes 'that he calls,' I was bitten!
I've been beaten!'
His whole key leg was open," Hammel saw when he came out to the boy.
"I called out that everyone should come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was flew to the Council Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as criticism.
It is not known which species is responsible for the attack.
Lifeguard. Larry Giles said at a media session that a shark was observed a few weeks ago in the area, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim caused traumatic injuries to the upper part of his upper body.
Officials closed the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to expand to the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's says Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams are fighting department store-type beauty walks that are operated by specialist assistants.
As part of a major expansion in the UK’s £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and household goods return, the larger beauty steps will be tested across the country in 11 shops and if this is a success the following year will be taken to more shops.
The investment takes place in beauty while supermarkets search for ways to fill racks once used for TVs, microwaves, and household equipment.
Sainsbury's says it's going to double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which will for the first time include trades such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with trade-specific areas similar to those seen in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also launches its Boutique Grimming Series again so that the majority of products are vying-friendly - something that attracts younger buyers.
In addition, the perfume retailer, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which opened in Croydon in South London last week and a second that will open later this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Internet purchases and a move to smaller quantities of food purchased daily at local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive officer of Sainsbury's, said that the shops are becoming more like department stores when the supermarket chain tries to fight back with more services and non-food products against Aldi and Lidl stock stores.
Sainsbury's put Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and also announced a number of Habitat sales points since it had bought both of these chains back two years, which, according to their bakeries' sales, strengthened and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to renew its beauty and appetite departments failed.
Sainsbury's in the early 2000s tested a joint venture with Boots, but the relationship ended with an argument about how the profits from the monkeys should be distributed within its shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's three years ago sold his 281-store of sightseeing business for £125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmaceutical chain.
It says Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxurious skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's trade director, said, "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty steps to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also recommended to special-informed colleagues who will be at hand to offer advice.
Our range of trade names are designed to meet every need and the attractive environment and convenient locations means that we are now an area of beauty that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones' anger after Holly Willoughby withdraws £11 million
Dragons Den-ster Peter Jones ran away 'suffering' after TV provider Holly Willoughby withdrew her to a £11 million agreement with his lifestyle branding business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their household clothes and convenience trade name, True,.
The couple’s business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop trade name.
This Morning provider, 37, announced on Instagram that she had withdrawn her.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den-ster Peter Jones furiously by withdrawing their lucrative lifestyle brand business - to focus on her own huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Bronne says Jones was "sudden" when TV's golden girl Tuesday at a tense meeting in the headquarters of his business kingdom in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new opportunities -- which amounted to £1.5 million -- meant that she could no longer spend enough time on their clothing and availability-trade name, True.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop trade name and would, according to dedicated Willoughby’s famous £11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she had left True, Jones climbed on a beam and sold Britain to one of his holiday homes.
A source says, "Truly was Holly's greatest priority at a distance.
It would be her long - term future that would bring her through the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw her was totally stupid.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday was so close to the announcement.
There's a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters that's right to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of this Morning provider, one of Britain’s stars that makes most of the money flow, the firm can hunt millions out of the bag as a result of the huge investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and household clothes, and the possibility that its disclosure may even encounter more delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin has been near Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up True in 2016 with Capp and Jones, 52, joined in March as chairman.
The couples have a vacation together, and Jones owns a 40% share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a trademark ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a provider of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source near Jones last night said, "We will not comment on his business."
Hard words 'and then we fall in love'
He ridiculed the criticism he received from the news media because he made a comment that some would view as "unpresidential" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his chamber "new-reader voice."
"I gave up nothing."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first conversation in June in Singapore as a major step after the nuclear weaponization of North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear weapons were fuelled.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said on Saturday, more than three months after the June Leader's Conference in Singapore, leaders at the UN General Assembly said that the North did not see a "corresponding reaction" of the US to North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noticed, the U.S. continues with sanctions on which to keep the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic look at his convention talk.
"We are further excellent with North Korea," he said.
"We were on our way to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim resulted in positive results — ending firefighting tests, helping to free fellow prisoners, and causing the rest of American soldiers to return home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be Presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this stamped arena, we would have almost 200 people just standing there," Trump said while he pointed to the crowd right before him.
Gulf and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed island, hundreds died
For example, in the course of the Lombok earthquake, foreign kidney organizations were said not to be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been kidnapped, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite for catalysing international aid.
"In many cases they were unfortunately very clear that they did not ask for international help, which makes it a bit difficult," said me.
Although Save the Children are setting up a team to travel to Palu, it is not certain whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials visit the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the global warming that Indonesia continues to endure, the country is sadly poorly prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunamis are built in Aceh, it is not a general sight of other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning sirens in Palu likely contributed to the loss of life, even though it was a warning of power.
Traveling between Indonesia’s many islands is the best challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to deal with earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia’s expanded infrastructure a core point of his election campaign and has spent money on roads and railways in vain.
But Mr. Joko’s administration is being challenged by fundraising deficits, as he looks back on election the following year.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of intense sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were kidnapped, such as Christian and Muslim gangs with caps, arrows, and bows, and other primitive weapons on the street.
Watch: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge spits good equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a Prime Minister's loss against Chelsea with an objective in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri told Sturridge when he was about 30 years away from the Chelsea target and his team was 1-0 behind.
He tipped the ball to the left before he pushed far to the finish line.
The effort went high above the frame as it swung to the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball slammed over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and in just the case.
"It was just to try to get in that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as far as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and bite once and not think too much about it and just spit."
Chelsea was at half-time 1-0 before the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute set a target.
The Blues' targethead in that play area with a backdrop played again to Mateo Kovacic before he landed near the middle field and ingested in the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly received and reported in the middle of the field.
With a beautiful forehead, he led Hazard into the frame.
Hazard passed the defense and ended up with a left foot-spin by Liverpool's Alison Becker in the worst target.
Liverpool runs the battle against Naples on Wednesday, 3 p.m., at the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea comes to London for 3 nm. in the UEFA Europe League for Videoton.
Two - way - up to 832 Indonesian tsunamis
The fatality in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami peaked to 832, the country’s disaster agency said early Sunday.
It has been reported that many people have been trapped under the rumbling of buildings that destroyed the earthquake, which struck Friday at an amount of 7.5, and caused fires of up to 20 feet, the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said to a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was demolished with the ruins of ruined buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, suspected of murder after a woman was killed
A murder investigation was sent from a pile after the body of a woman this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 a.m. in Grayson Mews in John Street with knives, and a 32-year-old man was arrested suspected of murder.
The police encouraged people in the area who had heard or seen anything to move forward.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is at an early stage, but I appeal to anyone who was around John Street in Birkenhead who suspected or heard anything to contact us.
I also appeal to any, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on Dashcam film material, to contact us as they can have information that can be inexcusable to us."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe that they know the woman at the scene raised questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are continued as the police said they were in the process of illuminating the victim’s neighbors.
A taxi driver who lived in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment but was informed by the police that no one was allowed into or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Citizens are now told that it will take hours before they are released.
A police officer has been told to tell one man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears on the scene.
She repeatedly said, ‘ It's so ugly.'
At 2 nm there were two police cars inside the cordon with another car just outside.
A number of officers were allowed to stand within the cordon to monitor the block's residences.
Anyone with information is asked to link @MerPolCC to DM, 101 or link Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 with log 247 of 30 September as reference.
Parliament's statute of Cromwell is becoming the newest memory meeting with 'rewrite of history' dispute
His banning will be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "society" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statutes that the shape of Oliver Cromwell would be a target outside the Palace of Westminster.
The imagery of the English Civil Wars was either ordered or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the deeds of his forefather Thomas in the past century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s colorful depiction of Cromwell was evidence of 19th century’s opinion and part of the history of a figure that many still believe to be memorable.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is being seen by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as advocate of the parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate picture is the subject of continued historical debate.
What is determined is that the conflict of the middle 17th century gave shape to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as Protector is also worthy of celebration and memorial."
Chinese Male Dwarves
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China.
The man, only identified by her, "Yuan", was found dead with a cut-off blood-covered battler near a hole at the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with fertilizers at a pig farm in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports Wednesday, he traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, her cousin found him dead, and found a door open to a neighbor's porch.
He said there was a big male pig in the corner with blood on his cheek.
A forensic study confirmed, according to the report, that the 550-pound pig killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloodthirsty and broken," said the cousin, who was called "Wu," quoted the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera material showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4.40 pm to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that the man killed does not belong to Yuan or his nephew.
A Mark Manager told the Evening New that the pig was closed to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan’s family and the trademarks are negotiating claims of compensation for his death.
Although odd, cases of pigs that have been reported by people have been reported.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their site in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig caught a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife frightened the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was fed by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "faster".
"They're just playful.
Their pickles, very curious... they're not about to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Rest of Orkaan Rosa will bring widespread heavy rains to the southwest U.S.
As foretold, weaker Orcaan Rosa as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring floodwaters across northern Mexico and the southwest U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa had windows from 5 am east time, 85 m.p.m., a category 1-orcaan, and was placed 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa Sunday is expected to move north.
Meanwhile, a struggle over the Pacific begins to form and to move east to the west of the United States. As Rosa Monday approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to drive heavy tropical humidity north-west.
Rosa will bring rain from up to 10 inches [10 inches] in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture in response to the approaching climb over the coming days will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous cataracts, waste, and possibly land damage in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause place-place rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over the largest parts of Arizona.
Flocks are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions because of the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It would be very unwise to put the desert in jeopardy by the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can cause deep - sanded rivers to fall and thunderstorms will bring heavy local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trunk will bring a little local heavy rain to parts of the coast of southern California.
Rainfall totals of more than half a inch are possible, which can cause low waste and smooth fish.
It will be the region’s first rainy season of the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rainforests will let Arizona get on Sunday and early Monday before the rain will increase the spread of Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
October can see intense temperature fluctuations across the U.S. as the North Pole cools, but the troops remain very warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central U.S. is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, numerous summer heat will try to increase and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern U.S. October are expected to start warm, with widespread 80s from the Southern Lowlands to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit [80 ° C] on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast suggests a higher chance of average temperatures for the eastern US for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people saw Thursday on six television networks the overwhelming testimony of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christian Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that had occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political death point continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday's on-the-fly approach: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh beat her in alcohol and tried to get her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a heart - to - heart witness, said he was 100% sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other networks that showed this, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure people who look in offices.
To put it in perspective, it's a hearing as big as one for a decisive football match or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion-makers supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had all the networks ahead with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's long hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second with 3,26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Concern was still high after the hearing.
Flakes were the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was arrested on Friday morning at CNN and CBS where defendants yelled at him when he tried to take a hysterical to a judicial committee.
He stood for a few minutes with his eyes down while CNN vividly pictured how he felt.
"I'm right here for you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
It was said to him, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flakes said that his office had issued a statement and had gone before the elevator door, said he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and exhaust networks covered all later living hours when the Judicial Committee would vote for the appointment of Kavanaugh to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do it with the understanding that the FBI will look at the claims against the candidate for the next week, as the Democratic minority requested.
Flake is partly convinced by talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republics would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump set up an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British EM May accuses critics of 'political games' about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May criticised her plans to leave the European Union, accused of "political gambling" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May day on September 29, 2018 for the Conservative We party conference in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview with her on the front page of the paper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued with his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that Britain and the EU should introduce the rates of each other was "very ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspected Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect in the fatal killing of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested on a second-degree murder charge, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the crash.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, reports CBS-filed WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police told him that he had shot Wayde.
His bail was set at $3500,000, the lawyer reported.
The judicial office of East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday that said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head at the neck.
The department commends the Louisiana State Police's continuing task force, the state police's crime lab, Southern University police and citizens for their assistance with the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanks to territorial law for his "zeal and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot predictor grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per race.
Friday morning LSU basketball coach Will Wade told the team to "put in" and "shock" about Wayde's death.
"That's what you're worried about all the time," said Wayde.
Volcanic as on Mexico City
As springed from the Popocatepeti volcano, the southern vicinity of Mexico’s capital reached.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican Saturday to stay away from the volcano after taking action in the crater and recording gas and as early as 24 hours of 183 releases.
The center has multiple vibrations and explosions monitor.
Social media images have shown how thin low - gas motor windows are covered near Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics marked an increase in activity at the volcano, which has moved 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police fights with Catalan separatist for commemoration of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesting pro-independence protesters with riot police, and thousands joined in protests to remember the first reminder of Catalonia's polarizing vote for resignation.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were held back by the riot police took eggs and threw powder paints that caused dark dust clouds in streets that usually wet from tourists.
A stowaway also broke out later in the day and the police had to use their knots to keep the brawl in.
In several hours, pro-independence groups sang on a show "No Forget, No Forgiveness" in confrontation with the unionist's cry of "Lunk Live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries caused in the riots reported the local press.
The tension continues to run high in the independence community a year after the referendum of October 1st, Madrid was considered illegal but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters voted overwhelmingly to become independent, but the participation was low, with those against descent who had much to do with the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the vote at the polls across the region.
Pro-independence groups camped Friday night to prevent an attack in support of the national police.
The attack continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist campaign with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful for the prospect that Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we went through one of the best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy because they could vote but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a life-long yet narrow victory in district elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain this year's moment, with many of their most famous leaders either in self-conceived exile or in custody for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who took up the campaign in support of the police on his phone, says the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It gets more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would be in European Parliament elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to reject the decline in democratic values and the oppression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Mans arrested after engine against home vasry

Detective Bob Blemmings said damage to the fences and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been shot at a stage in the car.
Menga target gives Livingstone 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston assures victory
Promoted Livigston surprised Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 matches as a driver of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga’s goal was evidence of the difference when Gary Holt’s team moved with Hibernian to the second.
Gerard's team stayed in the Prime Minister's season without getting away and came up next week before the predecessors Heart, who were ahead of them eight points.
Rangers were first hosted on Thursday for Rapid Vienna in the European League.
Meanwhile, Livingstone expanded their unsurpassed track in the division to six matches, with Chief Holt who has not yet tasted a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone plays odds against bot visitors
Holt's team had to run ahead long before they had set a target, with their roundness that Rangers had brought all sorts of problems on their necks.
SR broke through, but turned in front of the target hole, then AL could play out just after he got closer and CH’s head met over the target hole.
The hosts were pleased to have Rangers play before them, knowing that they could get the visitors with dead toys.
And so the decisive goal came.
Rangers set off a freehead and Livingstone created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson, who together gave Menga the chance to jump and draw a target from the middle of the frame.
At that time, Rangers owned but could not force the home defense, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
That pattern continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos had forced a stroke of Kelly.
Scott Pittman was fired by the feet of Rangers-targeter Allan McGregor and Lithgow had gone far enough to escape yet open play from Livingstone.
Overcrowding has repeatedly reached and reversed Livingstone’s frame, while two fines — after Halkett’s challenge by local replacement Glenn Middleton and one for handball — have been removed.
Livingston’s “Fenemenal” – Survey
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal games and outcomes for Livingstone.
Up to the last man was excellent; they still exceed expectations on this elevated job.
Their playstyle and team have been almost unchanged since their return to the first rank, but much honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was tremendous in his manipulative defense order while Menga for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on their toes.
Rangers, however, were short of inspiration.
As good as they could at times under Gerard’s standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once could they push through the home team, which is somewhat of a band for Rangers, which they found in the middle division.
Erdogan receives mixed receipts in Cologne
There were smiles and blue air on Saturday (September 29th) when leaders from Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO allies.
They had an impact on issues involving human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police have called for security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering before the mosque, but many supporters have shown up to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan fighters – many of their Kurds – also thicken their voices and both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The conflicting arguments reflect the disunity of a visitor greeted by some German Turks as a hero and identified by others as an autocrat.
Deptford Padon accident: Cycling dies in a collision with a motor
A biker died in a collision in London involving a car.
The clash took place around 10:15 BST near the junction of Beswod Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver stopped and paramedics were present, but the man died on the scene.
The clash comes months after another rider died in a hit-and-step at Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said officials are working to identify the man and to relieve his neighbors.
Road closures and bus routes were in place, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards injured in attack
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high security prison, the prison said.
On Sunday, about 09:30 BST broke out and was still running at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist "Tornado Guards" was called upon to handle the attacker, which included eight prisoners and was limited to one wing.
The guards were treated on the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to pay attention to a continued incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and be able to stay behind the trails."
HMP Long Martin hosts more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous offenders.
It was reported in June that the chief of the prison received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials were called upon to pay attention to serious disorder during which staff with billiards were attacked.
Orkaan Rosa Dreig Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kitsflude (Drug Zones Drag Dalk Advant)
It's unusual that a tropical low pressure hit Arizona, but that's exactly what can happen early next week when Orkaan Rosa's remaining energy is moving over the southwest desert and bringing catflies.
For Monday and Tuesday, the National Warfare has already issued catfights for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route to Phoenix on Tuesday, and to bring rain by Monday.
The National Heritage in Phoenix noted in a double that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status since 1950 within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The National Orkaan Center models predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated quantities of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon border of Arizona.
Other parts of the South American West, including the central Rockies and the Great Come, are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals of possibly 4 inches.
For those outside of the whale’s flow risk, Rosa’s rain will likely be a blessing as the region is plagued by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, this rainfall will probably be beneficial as the South West is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Droogtemonitor, only over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, Orkaan Rosa’s path leads to the approach of land around the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still in the rainy Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north to 12 miles per hour.
The storm’s cooler water in the Pacific, which is why it takes its power down.
Thus, it is expected that on Monday or evening, it will reach the country against tropical storms in Mexico.
Rain falls on parts of Mexico can be heavy and contain a significant flood risk.
"The total rainfall from 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to the north-west Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then, as a tropical storm north of Mexico before Tuesday in the early morning, reach the Arizona border as a tropical depression and then move through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday.
"The greatest danger expected of Rosa is a very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the US southwest," said the National Orkaan Center.
These rains are expected to cause life - threatening whales and torrents in the deserts and soil shifts in the mountainous areas.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured teenage boy was found at around 04:00 BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsummer Norton.
He was hospitalized where he was still in a stable state.
A 17-year-old, two- 18-year-old, and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials have appealed to anyone who may have any phone image material of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh's got ice amongst the community, the anger' of the Democratic Party.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "has been lying amongst the community, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed Thursday before the Congress and emotionally denied a claim by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified in the hearing about her claim.
The president said Saturday the Americans saw that day "the brilliant and the quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh, is a voice to confirm one of the most capable legal minds of our time, a judge with a pure record of public service," he told the crowd West Virginia supporters.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican appearance at the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lifetime.
I don't stand, but actually I stand," he said.
That's why I fight for these candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "stand up and prevent."
The first important procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected not to take place later than Friday, a senior GOP leader said to CNN.
Hundreds of deaths due to Indonesian earthquake, tsunamis, with ever - increasing numbers
At least 384 people were dead and many had washed away when huge waves broke down on beaches when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered in the city of Palu on the beach for a feast on the beach when fires broke from up to six meters (18 feet) high at sunset on the beach, many washed away after their death and destroyed everything that was in the way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-wide earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB said at an information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come on its own, it dragged cars, steams, houses together, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said and added that the tsunami was moving across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed into trees to free the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were displaced to 24 centers in Palu.
Photos released by the disaster relief show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges torn and broken down, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Naskokhaks shot the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's agency for the evaluation and application of technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's huge damage was about 200 times the power of the atom bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sits at the edge of a long, narrow bay, could have worsened the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls, and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found where they were trapped under the rubble of broken buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the accidents and damage could be larger along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Dongala that is close to the earthquake map.
Communication "is completely blocked with no information" from Donghala, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday because they did not report that a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said that the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur material shared on social media, one can hear a man screaming to the people downstairs in the street at the top of a building’s desperate warnings about the coming tsunami.
Within minutes a wall of water hits the beach and sledge buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately declare the image material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused major power shortages that cut off communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began to send cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuations still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo would visit clearing centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia's death rates are up to 800.
It is very bad.
Although World Vision's staff from Dongalla arrived safely in Palu City where workers were hiding in decrepit shelters set up in their office's courtyard, they went on their way to scenes of destruction, said Mr. Doseba.
They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It is very bad.
Even as relief groups begin with the daunting task of launching the disaster relief package, some people have complained that foreign relief workers are being prevented from traveling to Palu with much experience.
According to Indonesia’s guidelines, funds, stocks, and personnel from overseas can begin only after the disaster area has been declared nationally.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'Well, it's a national disaster,' we can open it to international assistance, but it doesn't have a status yet."
With the arrival of the second night at Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunamis, friends and relatives of those who have still been missing hope that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad stories of natural disasters.
Saturday a little boy was picked up from a pipe.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman for two days under a puine was stuck with her mother's corpse next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the director of the Indonesian national waveboard team, finished two of the missing waveboards for the Asian games that had ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Still others who were arrested at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"If a senior in the valley weaving field I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon tells how, in the hour after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel on social media circulated under the waveboard community, he unhopefully sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants participating in the beach festival.
However, his messages were answered only with one gray mark, instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thief steal $26,750 while refilling OTM at Newport on the Livee
The thief stole $26,750 on Friday morning at a Brink's worker who refilled an OTM at Newport on the Livee, according to a news statement from the Newport Police Station.
The car's driver was cleaning up an OTM in a entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, tracker Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press statement.
While he was busy, another man came "from behind the Brink's employee" and stole the bag money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspicions that fled from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity must contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name — to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "The beings previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, for a while, the nickname Ye and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change occurs before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to announce his new Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande with the program that canceled for "emotional reasons," said the program's manufacturer.
In addition to the fact that it is abbreviation of his current professional name, West has in the past said that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year when he discussed his album title with Radio Provider Big Boy.
"As I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of known rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was known, among other things, as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West co-worker, JAY-Z, has either ended up with or without a combination of letters and letters.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use force against civilians
Mexican newly elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, in effect, promised the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody revenge against students never to use military power against citizens.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use the force to kill the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot a peaceful demonstration in the square where up to 300 people were killed at a time when left - handed student movements were posted throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training opportunities drew young people to gangs.
U.S. has to double the KI funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the US has to double the amount spent on research in this field, investors and KI practice Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments come after several parts of the U.S. government have made KI notifications, even recently the U.S.A.'s overall formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China announced their plan: their goal of being the No. 1 in KI innovation by 2030.
"Double the KI research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in KI," said Lee.
The duplication of funding may double the chances that the next major KI performance in the US will be achieved, Lee said in a interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI SuperPowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Synovation Ventures, which has been commissioned in one of China's most prominent KIC companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on a KI system that hit the highest-ranked U.S. Othello player and later he was a manager at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotic challenge and asked when the next one will be, to help identify the following visual years.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government seats, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes away the academic leaders; it's the corporate law," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have appointed influential people from other universities to work with KI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help to support US AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhDs in KI," he said.
In July 2017, China’s State Council issued its next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a joint center for artificial intelligence aimed at involving partners from the business and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of a Contest Committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to the NSF, it currently recommends more than $100 million per year in KI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been under fire for months.
Macedonians vote in preference or have to change country name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday whether to change their name to "Republic of North Macedonia", an action that would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece that blocked its membership boats for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that their northern neighbouring country's name represents a requirement in the area and has denied their permission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycotting campaign was doubtful whether the appearance would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum stamp was read: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it is a price that can be paid to seek permission for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, for it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough parliamentarians said that they would accept the outcome of the vote to decide.
The name change will require a second-democracy in Parliament.
The state’s election committee said there were no reports of invalidity by 1 nm.
However, the rise was then only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voters in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia’s EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko deliver their votes for the referendum in Macedonia on the change of country name that will work the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small elevation and brought chairs to the tent by those who are going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads up, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the great majority will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he issued his vote.
He said a "yes" rash would be "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum – less than the required amount.
Another recording, carried out by Macedonia’s Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said that they would vote.
For the referendum to be successful, rise should be 50 percent plus one vote.
A rebate in the referendum will be the first serious rebate for the policy of a pro-West government since the government took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero navigates throughout Brighton’s defense for purpose
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling eliminated the Brighton defense in Manchester City’s 2-0 win Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously easy during his purpose in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goalkeeper received an evening at midfield at the beginning of the series.
He chased three Brighton defenders through before he hit the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He crossed at one more defendant before he passed several others on the edge of the Brighton Dwellhok.
He then pushed a nail to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English predictor used his first touch in the hook to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to hit the Brighton target Mathew Ryan with a spear to the right side of the net.
"Aguero struggles with problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are happy that he has set a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premierliga fight.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
On that game, Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had some touch before he led Sterling to the nearest target corner.
The Sky Blues’s predecessor had the ball thrown into the net just before he was across the back.
City trip Hoppenheim in Campioeneliga Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. by Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Schezer wants to play the game against Rockies
With the Nationals who are out of the game, there is not much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competing Scherzer wants to accept the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there's still implications for the Rockies, which has a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies got at least a promo selection place with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but still wants to fix their first division title.
"Although we don't play for anything, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any point of me this year in the face.
Why would I not want to take part in it?"
The Nationals still have to announce their initial player for Sunday, but according to the report, it is favorable to let Scherzer into such a situation.
Scherzer, who will start his 34th, had a throwing exercise session on Thursday and will play on his normal rest Sunday.
The Washington right-hand is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 extracts in 220 2/3 over this season.
Trump held conventions in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation around his Supreme Court elect Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican appearance at the mid - term elections.
"All we've done is on the game in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
It's one of the big, big – I'm not standing, but I'm actually standing and that's why I fight for these candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump went on, "A man sees this ugly, ugly radical group of Democrats, a man sees this happening now.
And now they are determined to take back the power by any means: one seeth the community, and the foolishness thereof.
They don't give to him who hurts, to whom they should walk, to receive power and authority; that is, to whom they desire, power and strength: we will not give it to them.
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and hinder."
"And one sees it over the past four days," he said, and called the Democrats "a plague and a pity and a lie."
He referred to the name of the Senate’s judicial committee’s high - ranking Diana Feinstein, who received hard orders from the audience.
"Remember her answer?
Did you delete the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, I'm waiting for one – it was really weak body language – the weakest body language I've ever seen."
Workers' party is no longer a large church.
It is unbearable to those who say what they think
When Momentum’s activist voted in my local party to put me under a censorship, it wasn’t just a surprise.
After all, I'm the last person in a string of Laborersparty LPs to whom we were told we weren't welcome – all because we said what we thought.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received similar treatments because she stood up to anti-Semitism in a fearsome way.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me because I was different from Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, of ironically enough similar issues that Jeremy was dealing with with previous leaders.
The announcement to the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting Friday said "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For the most part of my eight years as the local Labour Party LP, it was exactly what Friday’s AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, it is not today the display of many meetings and the promise of "more friendly, more favorable" politics has long been forgotten, if it has ever begun.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable for the party’s leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had shared similar political views, began to expect me to make a U-turn and take up positions I would never otherwise agree with – whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn't really matter what I say – there's a triad of shell language on social media that asks me not to be re-elected, a rejection of politics from the core and to tell me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And that is not just my experience.
In fact, I am happier than my colleagues because the comments directed to me are political.
I have a lot of respect for professionalism and determination for those colleagues who every day face a flood of sexist or racist insults, but never fear away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this age of politics is how the levels of injury have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party must cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every "museum of mistrust" or change of selection rules, the party becomes more energized.
I've had a lot of advice in the last two years that encourages me to stay under the radar, not to be so expressive, and then to be "ukei."
But I did not participate in politics to do so.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolgirl, encouraged by the Thatcher government's neglect that literally left my state high school dropouts, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – whether as a local council member or government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been at all confused about my political positions and areas where I differ from the present leadership.
To those who attended Friday's Mass, I can only say that with the country sending on a Brexit that is going to damage all households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to seize time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my electors, or they are now members of the Workers' Party: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats from being re-elected or political advantage will stop me from doing what I believe in your best interests.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose: Uncircumcised Father
Two late threes may have pulled the final outcome slightly off, but there is no doubt that Air earned to win this wonderful-funning Tentent's Prime Minister's game of the day.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard, the only uninhabited team of ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chances, that carried the home team and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
"We have so far been tested in our contests and we are still uninhabited, so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "Lord, they took their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, lost by Frazier Climo, made Air ahead, but a yellow map for Scotland player Rory Hughes, who was made available to the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot recorded an unforgivable three.
Climo increased Air's propriety with a penalty head, just before he, just before rest, lost a solotrie to make it a rest 17-5 for Air.
But Melrose began the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s three, cut by Baggot, reduced the backbone to five points.
There was a long recollection for a serious injury at Ruarid Knott that was carried off on a portable, and from the beginning Ayr increased the lead with a Stafford McDowall-three, doomed by Climo.
Ayr's observing Captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and once again Melrose used the extra player with an unscrupulous three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a lot of pressure.
The home team made a return and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he killed Climo without the ball, and MacPherson pushed the ball behind the upcoming Ayr Soldier.
Climo picked it up, just as soon as he had done almost at the beginning, after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong got his target head and the flag sent Gregor Henry away for the home team’s fifth three.
Still Game star looks like he's getting a new career in restaurant business.
Still Game star seems to move to the hospitality business after it was discovered that he was designated as the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays with old comedy cousin Greg Hemphil.
The duo announced that the next nine seasons would be the last of the program, and it seems that Kiernan is preparing for life in Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Arifjmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment, although a source at the Scottish Sun had a desire to get involved in Kiernan at Glasgow's "floating restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': rural Bolivia hope court will reopen away to the Pacific Ocean
Matros patrol a mass-covered fleet headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sailboat.
Fleetbases from Titicaca More to the Amazon with plaice with the slogan: "The sea is right ours.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the country around Bolivia, the nightmare they lost in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century to Chile is still fresh — just the need to reinvigorate the Pacific.
That hope is probably the highest that it has been in decades, while Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of talks.
"Bolivia has the moment, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course expects the outcome with a positive attitude." said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the IGH statement on large screens across the country, hoping the court in The Hague will find in favour of Bolivia's claim that – after decades of sporadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president – who next year faces a controversial fight for re-election – also depended on Monday's ruling.
"We are near to return to the Pacific," he in late August promised.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court in Bolivia will decide its favor — and that if so, it will change little.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to know Chilean territory, and has argued that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IHR's verdict comes only six months after the last demonstration shows that the case "was not complicated," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia’s cause, the past four years may have slowed it down.
"The issue of access to the sea was purchased by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales ’ aggressive rhetoric baptized any remaining Chilean attitude, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold close talks.
In 1962, the two countries sold out ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was extremely rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of differences with reciprocal benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America's most popular presidents – used the seafaring issue as a political crucible.
Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons won't come unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never first disarm their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He appealed to the United States to fulfill the promises made during a consultation in Singapore between the competing countries' leaders.
His remarks follow to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo apparently on the edge to resume nuclear diplomacy, which reached a dead point, more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "dream image" that continued sanctions and U.S. arrest to a statement that ended the Korean War will also bring the North on his knees.
Washington is careful to agree to the statement without first taking significant steps to disarm Pyongyang.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second consultation.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about doing away with an arsenal that considers the country the only way to ensure their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump advice.
Parisian fashion displays reveal the latest series of big headlines on the way to the shops near you
If you want to enlarge or completely reject the sun, you do not need to search further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne announced a series of low-end head coverings at their SS19 collection on the run that admired the style at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely unpractice guard went through this summer Instagram and these designers prepared their confused creations in the course of time.
The flashlighter by Valentino was a huge beige hat with a wide-ranging edge that hit the models' heads.
Other high attendances included watermelons decorated with jewels, a trade fair and even a pineapple – but it is not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had painted lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high couture.
One creature looked like a shuddering instrument, with a snorkel and a thick brilliance, while another looked like a molten chamberlain.
And if you continue the great fashion, it is your happy day.
Style viewers predict that the huge shield may be on the way to the shops near you.
The vast range follows briefly on the hooks of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-foot wide edge seen on all's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cultural label behind the extremely impractical hat spread over socialism has sent another great creation over the course – a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the wet-knit model that wore it.
The burnt orange raffiasak, finished with raffiafractions and finished a white leather handle on the top, emerged at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Modeweek.
Known style Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large ranges and beach bags appearing in shops next summer – as the designer made such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the request for super-invitory.'
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have a rhyme of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with a number of excellent exams, only reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community companies.
With over 30,000 schools all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and their position as world citizens.
As a education sector that can design and implement a suitable school curriculum, we see that world languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak with him in your own language, he will go to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exams, we can see that languages above are the ligaments with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages achieved a higher grade A.
The data collected from SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French, and 63 of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young adults will no doubt need in the future.
Languages now, as a professional, have the same reputation as the STEM subjects (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools ’ curriculums and elsewhere.
A survey by the United Nations Committee on Jobs and Skills found in 2014 that among the reasons that workers are struggling to fill posts, 17 percent are attributed to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely jobs that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what course a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such lifelong skill.
In order to communicate directly with people from other countries, a multilingual person will automatically be placed above the competition.
According to a YouTube survey of over 4,000 adults in the United States in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation and France was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is now so important to teach the language in today’s children.
To know a number of languages, especially those of developing economies, children will have a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will teach what is considered essential for the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarins or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose in independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to achieve success, regardless of what the future holds.
At this point, in a global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of great importance to the country's future, so it should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages really need to be seen as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to Scotland’s young people.
It needs to be done well.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will debut Sunday for San Diego Lakers
The wait is almost over for supporters to see how LeBron James begins his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker Chief Luke Walton announced that James in Sunday's opening season match against the Denver Nuggets will play in San Diego.
But exactly how many minutes he is going to play, it still has to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell argued that James would probably play a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six games in the preseason program.
"I don't need pre-season battles at this point in my career," he said.
Trump's West Virginia convention, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts this evening a flag of election conventions in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled regiments in the following week, including stops at friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation voice now held back for his choice to fill the High Court’s vacancy, Trump sought to build support for the upcoming election because the Republics were in danger of losing control of the Congress when it was voted in November.
How late is Trump's plot in West Virginia tonight and how does one look at it online?
Trump’s plot in Wheeling, West Virginia, was scheduled for 7 nm. ET this evening, Saturday September 29, 2018.
You can look below through live streaming to Trump’s summit in West Virginia.
Trump will probably pay attention to this week's trial for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense about allegations of sexual misconduct with an expected confirmation voice that has been held back for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main focus of this surplus is to help the republics facing difficult elections in November.
So President Trump's campaign said that these five sessions in the following week were aimed at "visiting volunteers and supporters while Republicans tried to protect and enlarge the majority they had in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Controlling the Congress is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy field season," a spokesman for the Trump Field Strategy, who refused to call his name, told Reuters.
Tonight's rally, arranged for the Wesbanco arena in Wheeling, supporters can withdraw from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the voice patterns.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to give him a jump at the poll," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryderbecker 2018: The US team shows that they have the courage to keep the hope alive when they enter Sunday’s single game
After three unilateral sessions, the four - game teams of Saturday afternoon may have just what this Ryderbek needed.
The swinging hose of the moment is a completely different sport concept but one in which players believe wholeheartedly, and certainly in competitions like these.
Where, then, would they say that the moment is now?
"They've gone ahead with six points and now it's four, so we carry it as a little moment, I reckon," said Jordan Spielth when he ran off at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points ahead, and another twelve that are played.
The Americans, however, feel, as Spieth says, that they have such a little wind in their sails and that there is much to encourage them, not least the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each recorded three points from four.
Spieth was mortally from the top to the clearing ground and led by his example.
That score of the ceremony got harder as his rounds progressed and he dreamed of a critical set to win the game four completely equals while he and Thomas were after two rounds with two back.
She sets up what won the 15th match for them, was greeted with a similar cry, the kind that tells a man that he believes the American team has another chance.
"You really just have to pull everything out and worry you about your own game," said Spielth.
That is all that those players now have.
18 pockets to print their stamp.
The only players who have more points than Spielth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakable story of the Ryderbeker.
Four out of four European couples were obtained, and nothing can be done wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't keep one on track on Saturday afternoon, but they also kept one on Saturday morning on track as well as during the last nine Friday morning.
That loop, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this overwhelming crowd, confirms that they are the players that should be hit Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can highlight a potential European victory when the sun is setting over Le Golf National.
Choose both at once or at different times.
However, it is too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short matches with Sergio Garcia, the four - year - old in the morning, when he played with Alex Noren.
One keeps track of the track number and two doubles on the front nine has put the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole from which they could not even come.
Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-balls and four-play teams are so exciting to watch from close because of the interaction between the couple, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way in which a strategy can change in a perspective.
So far, Europe has always played better than a team and on the last day has taken a significant lead, but this four-game session has also shown that the team of the US has the courage for the fight that some, especially at home, have doubted.
Europe runs 10-6 during the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after they came out of Saturday's four-ball and four-playing games.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their count to four points at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who was trying to maintain the trophy that they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, won the series 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance in the four games and won two matches, but they did not allow them to shrink back.
Jim Fury’s team needed eight points from Sunday’s 12 solo games to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novelty to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, who are called "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just the second pair in the history of the Ryderbeker who recorded four points after their first four matches.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the four-balls, they played excellently together to win a father Woods and American novel Bryson Dechambreau with an even convincing 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two matches Saturday, sometimes showed flash of brightness but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and four-games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rest during the morning's four-balls, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the four-games to a 2&1 defeat for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koopa -- which is the first and third on the world ranking.
Europe, however, did not always get their sense on a pleasant day with a little wind west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won a big tournament three times, and Justin Thomas, on Saturday, set the mark for the Americans with two points.
They scored a hard 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 3&4 in the four-games after they lost the first two chicks.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder-becker has a team recovered from a four-point stand when they enter the single game, even though Fury's team has to play only on equal terms to maintain the trophy because they already hold it.
After they were the second best for two days, however, they did not seem to have an attack on Sunday.
North Korea says they'll certainly not unarm with no confidence.
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations Saturday that continued sanctions would exacerbate their mistrust from the United States and that the country would certainly not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally without such qualities.
Ri Yong Ho told the world’s annual General Assembly that in recent years North Korea has hit “significant goodwill measures”, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear test site, and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see any corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without any confidence in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will certainly not disarm us unilaterally first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to the elimination of nuclear weapons, which would reward North Korea if it took gradual steps, his words seemed meaningful by not unilaterally rejecting the removal of nuclear weapons unconditionally, as Pjongang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first summit meeting between a US president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore when Kim undertook to work for the "destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised security to North Korea.
North Korea wants to have a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States said that Pjongang must first cease its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted attempts to mitigate strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. forces on the "destruction of nuclear weapons first" and exerts more pressure by tightening the level of sanctions to achieve their goal in a forceful way, and even objecting to the 'explanation of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions increase our distrust."
Ri said nothing about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump on which the U.S. leader earlier this week drew attention to the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings during the past five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae and added: "If the party in this question was South Korea and not the US, the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
However, Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's fire arrows would be directed to the US country mass after "Mr. Evil President" Trump for Kim called a "fireflyman" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations has Trump, who threatened last year to "destruct North Korea completely," Kim greatly praised for his courage because he had taken steps to disarm, but he said that much work should be done and that sanctions should still be there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a schedule for this, and said, "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years, or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
But, the US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said Thursday to the UN Security Council: "Implementation of sanctions by the Security Council must continue diligently and uninterrupted until we realize the complete, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unilaterally stepped up sanctions against North Korea in an effort to raise funding for Pjongang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the outside of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pjongang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Pjongang in July and said that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him only hours later that he had set "necessary demands."
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon to break off a missile and also a nuclear complex if the United States "consistent measures".
He said Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" he wanted to see were security assurances that Trump had promised in Singapore as well as steps towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow a course of rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year allows all its pre-graduate students to get more sleep in an effort to study the growing macho culture by working against caffeine driven 'full night' sessions.
An academic found that students at the world’s top university are often useless when it comes to the basic principles of how to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham Hospital and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after he gave a talk about the effect of sleep perception on learning.
'At the end of it one girl approached me and said, 'Why are they telling me this first, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had told her how important sleep was--which surprised me,' she told The Telegraph.
The course, offered this year for the first time, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance as well as how it improves their general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said that the university decided to take the course after it was found that students were seriously asleep during the week.
The hourly course includes a few interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a bedroom, where students should click on coffee cups, gowns, practice shoes and books to tell about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by the lack of sleep and the importance of a sleep dryer.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep exposure can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know it won't change the student's behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know--just as you have the right to know what its health effect is to choose to smoke cigarettes,' added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride to 'study all night' still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and ever increasing pressure on students meant that sleeping is a growing problem.
To make sure that you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's 'secret weapon' should be to avoid stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said--even to avoid putting weight on it, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a hunger mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after he had run one of his classes during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to pursue a campus course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students consider setting up an alarm for when they are going to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effect of 'blue light' that is being emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circular rhythm and lead you to trouble touching the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Target of Menga wins Gerard’s men
Rangers lived another sarcasm away when Dolly Menga’s goalkeeper Steven Gerrard’s uncomfortable team had a downside of 1-0.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first as visitors since February's 4-1 season at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only awarded Gerrard his second down in 18 games as a driver so that his team was eight points behind Hearts, which ran loose in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga took seven minutes before rest, and it didn't seem as if a Rangers team would play without much inspiration.
As Rangers now fall to the sixth position, Livingstone climbs to the third and is only behind Hibernian on target.
And there can be further difficulty for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown off the side.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that crashed past Ayr after the end of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that last week took a point from Hearts and he would have been in his nopes in the way his well-trained team had smeared their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have mastered ball ownership, but Livingstone did more when they had the ball.
In fact, after just two minutes, they had to record points when Menga’s first departure to Scott Pittman passed on to Allan McGregor’s goal, but the middle-field player took his big chance.
A deep cold by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his defence mate Alan Lithgow could only miss the last target.
Rangers took control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction about their games in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he had to get a sentence at the quarter-point when he and Steven Lawless fought, but the divorce judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian demands.
Rangers managed to get only two shots to the target during the first half, but the former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly was severely harassed by Lassana Coulibally's headshot and a soft targethead of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi’s opener at the 34th minute may have been against the direction of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it, even though it is only for their hard work.
Rangers again did not handle a deep set of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool and sent it to Menga for a simple roundup.
Gerard acted at the break when he rolled Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the butterfly sent to Morelos but the impressive Kelly of his Strip chased to the block.
But Livingstone continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgov and Halkett, who had long balls inflated after long balls.
Holt’s team could have increased their momentum in the last stages, but McGregor got up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could get in from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton had another late request for a penalty bribe when he got in touch with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away.
Almanac: The Discovery of the Geigerteller
And now a page from our "Sunday morning" German: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and WE TELL OTHER ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geigerteller.
Since then, the Geigerteller has been a support pillar of science, and it has also become a support pillar in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans have played:
Man: "What on earth is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geigerteller used to trace radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you set up these surfaces, you can even hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactive activity in the minerals.
Evans: "Look, it's about to break."
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues.
New cancer component can learn to 'see' the immune system
New cancer component can learn the immune system to 'see' and kill bikers cells
Disposal learns immune system to identify wheel cells as part of treatment
Method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them into a laboratory
They can then see a protein that's common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A test substance shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman who was treated with the antigen, who learned the immune system to identify cirrhosis cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them into the laboratory so that they can "see" and then inject the cells again into a protein that appears in many cancers and is called HER2.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising antibody."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to remove immune cells from patients and "learn them" how to attack cancer cells has worked to beat some kind of leukemia.
Kanye West began a pro-Trump riot after acting on SNL, while he wore a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was shown in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after a thorough action in which he believed US President Donald Trump and said that he would make him preferred in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great-Pet, he marched out against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I talk so often to a white man and their say, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racer?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star scoffed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee on charges of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it has not been discarded, the imagery of West’s dispute has been loaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock the West by placing it.
Also, at the hearing, the West complained that he was having trouble raising what he wore on his head.
"They put me behind the high tower.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat.'
They have my commandments!
And then they say I'm in a low place," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
The West went, "Do you want to see the low place?" and said that he would wear his "supermantel," because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want to move the world forward?
Try to love."
His comment at least two times triggered an audience and members of the SNL roll division seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there who said to the publication, "The whole studio became death-style."
West was introduced as a late substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, the space fighter Mac Miller died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised by the performance of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who said, "To one of the bravest spirits: thank you that you stand up against the skewer."
But Mrs. Karen Hunter suggested that West was just "who he is and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose to reward someone NOT (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") that I believe accept an ideology and preach that endangers my society.
He's free.
We too," she added.
Before the show, the space shuttle announced on Twitter that he changed his name and said that he was now "the beings who were once known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
With spacecrafter, Snoop Dogg, had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, wild musical Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticises toxic manhood
Kit Harington is known for his swordsmanship role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they should be tongue to be respected.
Kit talked to The Sunday Times Culture and said he thought 'something went wrong' and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married with his fellow from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he 'reasonably strong' felt about working on this issue.
'I personally feel quite strong about it at the moment--where did we go wrong with masculinity?' he said.
'What did our men learn as they grew up with regard to the problem we see now?'
Kit believes that television may be responsible for the growth in toxic manhood because of its extreme male characteristics.
He went on, "What was born and what was taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that young boys feel they should have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think it really is one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
Because something apparently went wrong with our young men.'
in the interview he also admitted that he would not participate in any of the Game of Thrones' pursuits--and pursuits--when the series next summer came to an end, because he said he was 'prepared with battlefields and horses'.
Since November Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thought that the best thing that came from Game of Thrones was to meet his wife, Rose.
'I met my wife on this program, so that it gave me my future family, and my life from here,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy crowned fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple married on the outskirts of Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, its health officials.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, which represents a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spread by some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have done HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials at a conference in the province of Yunnan said.
Year after year, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission by sex is a critical issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in 1997 in China, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who had sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to work on the matter.
Maxine Waters denied that a staffed GOP senators cleared the data, condemning 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters issued a statement on Saturday that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations were driven by "ultra rights" experts and websites.
"Lifes, lies, and still hideous lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The detailed information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for the US Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared Thursday online, placed by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate panel's hearing on the allegations of sexual misconduct against the appointed High Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the sites is related to Waters' office and reported the information of a member of Waters' staff, reported the Hill.
"This unfounded claim is absolutely false and an absolute lie," the Waters continued.
"The member of my staff -- whose identity, personal information and security were put at risk because of this deceptive and false claim -- was not at all responsible for the interpretation of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters’ statement quickly exposed online criticism, including former Withouse Press Representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies to anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This indicates that she does not have the temper to be a member of the Congress.
When accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
He should not be challenging.
He should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters ’ reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing to be too angry during Thursday’s trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who tries to light water in the election from the cushions, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it is true," he whispered.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these deceptive claims.
"We'll make sure that the guards are put in charge," she went on, "and that they'll be legally responsible for everything they do that is destructive and dangerous to every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again review - flower Rowan Atkinson spy putty
It is now traditional to search for Brexit sign in any new film with a British effect and it seems to apply to this relive of Johnny English action comedyfranchie - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn further difficult.
Will the tongue-in-the-choice self-satisfied on the subject of how obvious power we are is the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the helpless Johnny English with his exhausting and rubbery face had his license to renew everything for the second time--and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comical creation for non-English film audiences.
He is, of course, the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his vicious claim to sophisticated elegance, a bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr. Bean and a good shot of that old who contributed a single note to the Chariots or Fire-tealed at the openness of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
He was also originally based on the traveller and international man of puzzles, who left chaos behind him, who Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard ads.
There are one or two beautiful moments in this latest version of JE.
I liked Johnny English who ran into a helicopter while he was dressed in a middle-class pendulum and the screw blades cut short against his helmet.
Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy is shown, but the humor feels fairly faint and peculiarly exaggerated, especially when the "nursive" movie trademarks such as 007 and Mission can now use comedy with confidence as a component itself.
The humour feels that it is softer to children than to adults, and for me Johnny English’s adversity is not as original and focused as Atkinson’s silent film clips in the person of Bean.
The eternal thematic assumption is now that Britain is in serious difficulty.
A copper cracker infiltrated Britain's super secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, until the agent's distraught to service -- a pitiful little roll for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a first minister who is a blown-up and insulting character, who already experienced an overall collapse of political unrest: Emma Thomspson does her very best with this case-Teresa May character but there's only little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy is in danger, she should call someone out of her retirement.
And that means the struggling Johnny English itself, now in service as a teacher at some decent institution, but what from the record gives lessons about how to be a secret agent, there are some nice jokes here when English offers a school or rock-type spying school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency order and is reunited with his former long-term companion Bough, again translated by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a diving commandant, an all-embracing role in which Vicki Pepperdine is expected to be too little.
Thus, the Batman and Robin are fully engaged in the sacred service of Her Majesty and come down to Olga Kurylenko’s beautiful wife, fatal Ophelia Bulletin.
Meanwhile, the prime minister was under the dangerous assumption of the charismatic technology billionaire that he could solve Britain’s computer problems: the ridiculous Jason Volta, translated by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey from ridiculous escapadas: faint as cellars they burn a French restaurant, causing their chaos when they smear on board Volta's luxury oil; and English allows pure anarchy to break off when he tries to use a head for virtual reality to become familiar with Volta's house.
For that last scene nothing is saved, but as cute and as extensive as it may be, the whole affair is quite like child TV.
Fairly moderate.
And as with the other Johnny English roll pictures, I couldn't stop thinking: couldn't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really made his talent his right?
Work refuses to think of a British plan to work for a four-day week but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party has to consider a drastic plan that will cause Britta to work a four-day week -- but for five days.
Some people want to claim that company-based savings caused by the artificial intelligence (KI) revolution should be transferred to workers by giving them extra day.
It will make workers enjoy a three-day week - but they will still take the same payment home.
Sources say that at the party’s economic agenda and plans to put the country into the favor of the workers, it will ‘pass’.
To change after a four-week week, the Trades Union Congress signed as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A Senior Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: 'a policy review will be announced by the end of the year.
'It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an ambition that fits the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party will not be the first to sign such an idea, with the Green Party that promised a four-day work week during its campaign for the general election in 2017.
The ambition, however, is currently not signed by the whole Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Workers' Party said, 'A Thursday is not a party policy, nor is it considered by the party.'
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to explore his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of "unsightly directors" and "winners" from service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not recover their entire investment since a Labour Government can make 'abstentions' on the basis of alleged infringement.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on company lines and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 per cent of equity in private sector enterprises to employees, who can receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 minutes" or the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh may change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court with at least one week's delay and the question of whether the Bureau's findings can convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that Sunday was broadcast, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley for Republican sense. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could get anything they could change.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, and the accusation came out, and said, 'Have you done this?
He was determined, certainly, without doubt."
Graham’s voice, however, seems unchanging.
"I have formed my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it will require a charge of dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett strongly denied it," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she calls could not confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything change new."
What is the World Burger Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the World Burger Festival, an annual music event that has a particularly impressive group of stars that acts and has an equally impressive goal; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Burger Festival is now in its seventh year, and during the festival, tens of thousands of people will stream to Central Park’s Great Law to enjoy not only acts by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of the occasion to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Burger Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World War II project, an international pre-accession group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free card for the occasion (unless you are willing to pay for a BBP card), concerters had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But just how successful was a 12 - year - old world citizen who remained in pursuit of his goal?
Is the idea to reward people with a free concert, a good way to convince people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clitivism" people who feel they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a double?
Since 2011, Worldburger says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, supporting a multitude of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to over $37 billion that will potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion was already paid or collected.
The group estimates that the confirmed money has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a U.K.-based company of investors and implementers engaged in "helping children achieve their full potential", and promises to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after they have received more than 4,700 tweets from World Citizens.
"With the support of the U.K. government, donors, national governments and world citizens as well as you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," the Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions to bring the UK closer to improving nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with food seizures.
In response to one of the general questions on his website that asks, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Worldburger replied, "It will be a long and hard path--sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-discrimination movements before us, we will be successful, because we have more power together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the artists who are on this year’s occasion in New York, who will be offered by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S.A. can use fleets for "blocks" to stop Russian energy exports - Minister of Home Affairs
"If necessary," Washington may leave him on his fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, the US Minister of Interior Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Sinke claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - in particular where it works at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an obstacle to exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just as in Eastern Europe, the south of Europe," he claimed.
According to one official, there are ways and means for you to do so.
"The United States has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the seas are open, and, if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy does not land on the market," he said.
Sinke addressed the participants of an opportunity offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profit that views themselves as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington’s approach to handling Russia and Iran and noted that it is practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, a little or more, to finance and replace fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a "one-tongue" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The decisions come as Trump administration was on a mission to replace the export of their liquid natural gas to Europe with a hop in order to replace Russia, by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
For that reason, the Trump administration's officials, including American President Donald Trump himself, tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unappropriate" Nord Stream 2-pyplyn project, which according to Trump Berlin makes Moscow's "prisoned".
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2-pyply, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fiery opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers must be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Minister of Energy, Aleksandr Novak, said at a meeting with American Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. view triggered a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI) called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said at a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider it carefully" to be president in 2020," the Senator of Massachusetts said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "consider it seriously" to stand as president after the mid-term elections.
At a village meeting in Hollywood, Massachusetts confirmed Warren that she would consider standing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and correct our broken government and it includes a woman in the highest sport," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider it seriously to stand for the president."
Warren had her opinion on President Donald Trump's air during the village meeting and he said "take the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm up to my inner concern about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very vocal in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
On a two-day Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
A recording released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own electors did not think she should stand in 2020.
Eight-and-fifty percent of "probably" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Centre/Boston Globe recording.
Two-and-thirty percent supported the idea of standing.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former governor Deval Patrick should stand, with 38 percent that supported the idea that he should stand potentially and against it 48.
Other high profile democratic names that were discussed to be possible in 2020 include former fish president Joe Biden and Vermont's Senator Bernie Sanders.
When he said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin called Track Palin's PTSV by Donald Trump convention
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he joined in September
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son goes through, which he has gone through since he came back, I have sympathy with other families that feel the consequences of PTSV and the injury with which our soldiers return," she told a audience at a convention for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they're coming back a little differently, they're coming back hard, they're coming back and wondering if there's any respect for what they've given to their fellow soldiers and air force and every other member of the army for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assaulting a woman, interfering with complaints of domestic violence and possession of a gun while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 states, D.C. supports the challenge of new asylum policies
Eighteen states and District Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that asylum refuses victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district have submitted a friend-of-the-court-law warrant in Washington on Friday to support a asylum seeker and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the claimant in the Grace v. Sessions trial submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August was not disclosed.
She says to her friend "and her violent sons," she abused, but American officials refused her request for asylum on July 20.
She was held in Texas.
The state prosecutors who supported Grace, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produced a large number of applicants for US asylum, described themselves as nations facing deep-rooted gangs and domestic violence.
In 2014, the new U.S. asylum policy turned a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (Council of Immigration Appeals) that allowed immigrants without the necessary documents escape from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Columbia's Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday in a statement that the new policy "neglects the state, federal and international laws."
"Federal laws require all asylum applications to be determined on the specific facts and circumstances of the requirement, and such a lawyer violates that policy," said the friend-of-the-court court warrant.
Prosecutors further argued in the legal order that the policy that immigrants refuse access is damaging the U.S. economy and says it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "will provide necessary work."
Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions commissioned immigration officials in June to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing from domestic and gang violence.
"Asiel is available to those who leave their country of birth because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership to a specific social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his announcement of policy on 11 June.
Asiel was never meant to alleviate all the problems — even not all the serious problems — that people face every day around the world.
Hopeful rescue efforts in Palu while deathly doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasing.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma while she comforted her corrosive baby boy at a clearing-house in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute brings an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce."
Citizens were seen returning to their ruined homes, searching for drunken possessions, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-wide shrieking, were overwhelming.
Of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who made a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu’s air hospital where patients are treated outside because of constant strong shocks.
Trane fills his eyes as he recounts the violent earthquake that shook the fifth floor of the hotel room that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was impressed at the wall's puin, I think," Harris told the Associated Press and added that he and his family were in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then stopped.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador blames China for 'disguise' with 'propaganda advertising'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American newspaper that praised the mutual benefits of U.S. China trade, the US ambassador for China Beijing accused the US press of being used to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the China Daily's paid inception in the Des Moines Register – the state of Iowa's newspaper with most sales – after he accused China of joining the US Congress elections on 6 November, a complaint that denies China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. elections, noted what US officials told Reuters, a new phase in an increasing campaign by Washington is to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a escalating trade war that has resulted in their tariffs being likened to each other's imports.
China’s early payroll in the trade war aimed to beat performers in states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, said Chinese and U.S. experts.
Terry Branstad, the US Ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing wounded US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstadt wrote in an opinion poll in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "now exacerbates the ambiguity by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government seized America's cherished tradition of free speech and on a free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, a person at the newspaper kiosk in the street here in Beijing will find very limited divergent voices and not see any true reflection of the diverse opinions that the Chinese people have about China's worrying economic tracheque, giving that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has flocked away from the offer to publish his article," although he did not say what newspaper.
Republics foreign women's electorate for inter-elections with Kavanaugh debake, warning analysts
While many top republics at the Supreme Court- named Brett Kavanaugh stand and defend him in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warned that during the forthcoming elections, they would see a reaction, especially of women.
The emotions are so high, and most republics remember that they already indicate that they want to continue with the vote.
Those things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School for The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s recommendation for an FBI investigation on the nipperke will be enough to track down tough voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday--they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, soldiers "November is on their way!" were shocked while they protested in the Senate entrance gate while the Republics that had chosen the Judicial Committee to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the newscast.
"People say it was already high; it is true.
But it can be higher, especially among the swaist-female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who often do not vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which set out the details of her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court, analysts said a reaction could follow if Republics continued with the confirmation.
"It became a nightmare for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's vote or the final vote and or Kavanaugh being put on the bench, it's also about how the Republics handled it and how they treated it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, pointed out to the news channel a group that helps choose Democrats.
But Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with a little more to choose the latter.
A new recording of YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents are sure or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35 say they are sure or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh had probably watched during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
According to Flake’s report, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford, as well as at least one other claim, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate’s Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh had assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court-reminded her sex as they attended a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web plans to start a new internet to tell Google and Facebook the battle
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world’s web, leads a starting point that tries to interact with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that built on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people are allowed to access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee ridiculed the idea of Inrupt as "world domination."
"We must do it now," he said of the project.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "Personal Online Data Storage" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, lists of works, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique to the personal online data storage is that it is entirely based on the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization by data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company’s HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers of the personnel contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt web site.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about the announcement of an overall change anyway, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a location on a medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee converted the internet when he founded the World Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as he leads Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still remain the founder and director of the World Web consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic about this next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: WW1 Victoria Cross-spiritual celebration
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a fighter during World War I was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt.Kol vr. Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sharp shooter and never knew that he had earned the highest British military honor.
A monument was discovered on Saturday by his two little boys at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "briliant symbols" that the stone was discovered just 100 years after his grandfather's crowned performance.
According to the London Gazette, lt.Kol. On September 29, 1918, he led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very dense mist and under heavy fire from the fields and machines."
He later rushed to the fire line and with the "greatest resistance" led the line forward before he only stormed a field gun and blew out three of the department.
Lt.Kol Vann was killed on October 4, 1918 by a German sharpsman – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions are "something I know I can never stand, but something that is humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a crown to the parades, led by the Brentwood Imperial Jeugorkes.
Michael Vann said he "felt hurt to be able to play a role in the parades" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support given by a crowd of people."
MMA supporters stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Pappa Pig
Picture yourself, you stay awake all night to watch the packed Bellator 206, just to not be able to watch the main event.
The program of San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main program that would be broadcast directly by night in the UK on Channel 5.
At about 6 a.m., just when Ggard Mousesi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to tell each other the battle, viewers in the United States were left speechless when the cover changed to Pappa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying awake especially for the fight until early hours.
One supporter on Twitter described the transition to the childhood picture as "some sick joke."
"It's a government regulation that the content was not suitable at 6 nm, so they had to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Fish President of Marketing and Communication, when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the Pig," yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would work on their schedule to include future U.K. viewers.
"I think that when I think of the broadcast, I think we can probably do something," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we'll be unable to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when it switched, there were many texts sent over and over and it wasn't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six — as we normally do — and we have tried to offer more to our adherents and just go over our time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'minor' about sexuality
Olympic divers Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior about his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't go to high school before he realized that "not everyone like me is."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs offered by Lauren Laverne, he said he was praising his feelings for gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that to have become a parent, he was less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular provider of the year’s long program, Kirsty Young, took off a few months due to illness.
When he appeared as a rejection on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else when he grew up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings are less than, and otherwise feel, the real things that gave me the strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist became a high profile LGBT fighter and used his appearance at this year's state-of-the-art games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says he smells his feelings because he is so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and to give other "hope".
The three-time world champion said to fall in love with a man – U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 – "he caught him side by side."
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than he is, but says the age difference has never been a question.
"When you go through so much at such a young age," he went to his first Olympic Games at 14 years of age and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and low points.
The couple became parents in June of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says his "whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything went about 'I must win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son died the same name as his father Robert, who died at age 40 in 2011 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says that his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked for or they had all the cards for London 2012 — because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not unwelcome," he said.
The following year, Daley won the 2012 Olympic Games.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed about my life for a long time--to dive before my homework at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection — Proud by Heather Small — who also played with him in the construction of the Olympic Games and still gave him chicken meat.
Desert Island Disks is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson does not drive and withdraw to Saturday’s Ryderbeker
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder win, but he will have to fit his form to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a record 12th time in the two-year event, was withdrawn by Captain Jim Fury for Saturday's four-ball games and quarters.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time Major-winner will share his day in the meantime to be a race leader and work on the training bench at his game in hopes of correcting what trembles.
Even at the height of his career, he was never the right driver, and therefore the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National job where the long rough is always punishing the heavy pits.
And as if the job on his own wasn't challenging enough, Mickelson Sunday came up in his ninth match against the exact British Ope champion Francesco Molinari, who had competed with new Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, start the 12 single games well, Mikkelson’s competition can be absolutely vital.
Fury expressed his confidence in his husband, not that he could say much differently.
"He had his role he had today fully understood, gave me a kick on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be right tomorrow," Fury said.
"He has much confidence in himself.
He was in the Heldes Hall, and he has contributed so much to these sparrows this week.
I probably didn’t think he would play two games.
I put more forward, but that is how things worked out, and that is what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there on the job, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will exceed Sunday Nick Faldo’s record for the player who played most of the Ryderback contests.
This can mark the end of a Ryderbek race that never really matched the heights of its individual performances.
Mickelson had 18 wings, 20 lowers, and seven halfs, although Fury said that his presence had contributed countless aspects to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, caught, likes to tear the fool, and he's a wonderful old man to have in the Spaniard," he explained.
"I think the younger players enjoyed it too to mess with him, which was fun to see.
He offers so much more than a game."
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows great progress can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advance before the last day's single game in the Ryderbek can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Den made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama match, where the team under the leadership of Seven Ballesteros, had a five-point lead, but won only nail scrap with 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"A man continues to remind himself that we had a great advantage at Valderrama; we had a great advantage at Brooklyn, where we had lost, and at Valderrama, where we won the nail tie," said Bjorn, on the photo, after watching how the 2018 Class won 5-3 and yesterday was 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that it is not over.
You'll be all right in the morning.
Go out and do all the right things.
It is not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and it's to try to win the trophy, and that's where the focus remains.
I say all the time, I focus on the 12 players that are in our team, but we are also well aware of who is on the other side – the best players in the world."
Rejoice about how his players were in danger on the hard golf course, Bjorn adds: "I will never go ahead with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different color.
Tomorrow it's the individual participation that comes in turn, and it's a horse of another color.
It's wonderful to be out there with a mate when things go well, but when you're there individually, you're tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you must convey to players, getting the best out of yourself in the morning.
Now leave your mate behind, and he should get the best of himself."
In contrast with Bjorn, his husband would want Jim Furyk to have his players walk better individually than they did as players, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Fury himself had been surrounded on both sides of that great last-day, where he was part of the wish team at Brooklyn before he ended as a loser when Europe achieved the "wonder of Medina".
"I remember every hideous word of it," he said in answer when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of his players spoke up in 1999 on the way to that last day.
"We had 12 important matches tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as seen by Brooklyn, as seen by Medina.
When that moment begins in one direction, it puts a lot of stress on those middle - class games.
We have prepared our team accordingly, and divided the men that we felt, you know, will bring to us tomorrow something magic."
Thomas was given the task of trying to fight the attack, and he faced Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Paulter, who are the other Europeans in the upper half of the division.
"I chose this group deliberately in this order, for I think it covers it to the end," said Bjorn about his single-game choices.
Germany’s new warship is being postponed
The German army’s newest frigate would have served in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be there until at least next year, due to faulty systems and growing costs, reports local media.
The entry into service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the Time newspaper quoted by a military spokesman.
This vessel had to join the Navy in 2014, but the disturbing postal delivery issues plagued this ambitious project’s fate.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a powerful air- and anti-ship missile as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods — it should be possible to develop the latest fractals for up to two years away from tairshavens.
However, constant delays mean that the advanced warships — which will obviously enable Germany to design power overseas — will already be obsolete by the time they act in service.
The disastrous F125-fregate was recorded last year when the German fleet officially refused to put the vessel in service and sent it back to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time that the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Few are known for the reasons for the return, but the German media said that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" would make the ship useless if it was developed in a field race.
Software defects are particularly important since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be handled by a crew of about 120 mattresses – only half of the manpower on older Bremen class frigates.
It also revealed that the ship was severely overweight, reducing the workflow and reducing the fleet’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" is probably twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the wrong hardware, the award label for the entire project – including the training of the crew – also raised a question.
Apparently it reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the original €2.2 billion.
Problems that have plagued the new frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the power of Germany’s fleet is on the wane.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the fleet's "ships that can be deployed are underway."
The officer said that the issue had worsened over time, for old ships had been out of service, but no replacement vehicles had been provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg classes could join the fleet.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of bats
New research is carried out on land in the Scottish Highlands aimed at revealing how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual and soprano bat as well as the brown long- and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on the property at important locations to track fly - and - fly activities throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also make mobile recordings using hand-guides.
Expert-canals of all recordings will check the frequency of the bats' calls and determine which species they do.
A habitat map and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS hope will reveal what habitat areas are the most important for the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management such as pasture creation and how to best manage forests for bats and other associated species.
Flemish populations in Scotland and throughout the United States have declined significantly during the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as can fly paper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Flying mice are not really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-orientation technique to display gogs and obstacles on their flight size.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land around the country, is very serious about bats.
These include ten trained experts who carry out regular recording and sleep - care inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization even established Scotland’s first and only dedicated batting reserve at Thrave’s estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bats.
Landowner David Thompson says that the land is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Thrave we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veterinary trees and all the good habitat.
But there is so much about bats that are still unknown, so the work that we do here and on other properties helps us to understand better what they need to flourish."
He stresses the need to search for bats before maintenance is done in property because it is possible that unconscious destruction of a single shell of up to 400 females and infants can mean death and extermination of a whole local population.
Flying mice are protected and it is illegal to kill, control, or prevent or destroy their sleeping quarters.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations go."
Ronaldo dismisses rape claims as prosecutors prepare for German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo filed rape charges against him as "false news" and said that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His prosecutors are ready to review German news magazine, Der Spiegel, which published the claims.
The Portuguese and Juventus forecaster was accused of rapeing an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in 2009 at a Las Vegas hotel.
He reportedly paid her $375 000 to remain silent over the incident, reported Der Spiegel Friday.
In an Instagram live video in which he spoke to his 142 million followers, hours after the claims, Ronaldo, 33, finished the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the five-time balloon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the whole thing.
I'm a happy man and everything's right," the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's prosecutor is preparing to read Der Spiegel about the claim, which they called, according to Reuters, "ineligible reporting of suspicion in the field of privacy".
Prosecutor Christian Schertz said the player would claim compensation for "moral compensation for any amount corresponding to the seriousness of the damage, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he believed she had been raped, according to documents submitted by Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, fell on his knees and said he was "99 percent" a "good old" left in the trap by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to a trial outside the court because she was "feared for revenge" and was concerned about being "obviously humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she wants to reverse the order now because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was at the time of the alleged attack to join from Manchester United at Real Madrid and moved this summer, in a €100 million match to the Italian giant, Juve.
Brexit: UK will 'repent forever' if their motor manufacturers lose
The UK 'will regret it forever' if they lose their status as world leader in motor production to Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "serious" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will have to stop production at the factory in Burnston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a non-conformity-Brexit can cost posts.
Last year, the Burnston plant - produced by Toyota’s Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150 000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Head of Toyota at Burnston.
Other U.K. engine manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, were afraid to leave the EU without agreement and how cross-border trade would work.
BMW, for example, said that they would close their mini-plant in Oxford for a month to Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what motor manufacturers say supply chain risks are in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line runs on a "net time" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for motors on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, there may be distortions on the border that the company says can lead to delays and deficiencies in parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark says Theresa May's Chequers Plan for future relations with the EU has been "accalibrated precisely to avoid those border controls."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that, as I say, will allow us not only to enjoy the current success, but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The indications of not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, are that we absolutely need to continue with what a very successful set of supply chains were."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but warned that in the long term, added costs could reduce the design’s competitiveness and ultimately cost mail.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and the United Union co-founder, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when this post disappears, it never comes back.
A government spokesman said, "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump encounter with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says Withuis
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein can be "exposed for another week" while the fight over nominated for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continued, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Legal Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian election mix, links between Trump-helpers and Russia, and possible law enforcement by the president.
Whether Trump is going to thank the adjunct prosecutor general or not, and thereby threatening Mueller's independence, Washington's gossip stories have been fueled for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of carrying a recorder to engage in talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House, in the middle of reports that he was on his way to thank.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then with the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not to thank" Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate-regbank's trial in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump postponed a one-week FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh and the full Senate vote further.
Trump’s pers secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for it has not yet been determined; it may be this week, I can see that it is postponed for another week with all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up."
Some journalists will differ with that statement: Sanders hasn't held a Withouse personal information session since 10 September.
Gasher Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of information sessions is not because of a contradiction for TV journalists who are "effect-watching," although she said, "I will not argue with the fact that they are impact-watching."
She then indicated that direct contact would increase between Trump and the press.
"The president holds more V&A sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without adding proof, "We looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the President of the United States questions, then it is infinitely better than to talk to me.
We're trying to do it a lot and you've seen it a lot in the last few weeks and it's going to take the place of a personal information session when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves or participates in open sessions or press statements with visiting dignity officials.
Solo-perstellations are scarce.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbounded and timeless appearance in front of journalists gathered there.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit-free
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to show the country’s gratitude and to express the wish that they will remain in Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months before the UK withdrawing from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering costs of negotiated status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU continued on withdrawal, on the way to the expected decisions of these autumns.
But the U.K. government has also reinforced their preparations for a possible non-conformity scenario.
I know it's a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I want to repeat how much I pay each employee’s contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from around the EU and beyond bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the health service and that benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we want you to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after major injury
Tennessee State Tigers' liner Christian Abercrombie had an emergency operation after he suffered a major injury on Saturday 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee-span's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State’s chief chief, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the breakup.
"He came to the edge and kind of just collapsed there," said Reed.
Drivers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen along the side line before he was placed on a portable and was taken back for further evaluation.
An officer of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie is from the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet about the type/range of the injury" and Tennessee still tries to detect when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second year, was in his first season at Tennessee State after he moved from Illinois.
He killed Saturday five times before leaving the game, bringing his total season to 18 deaths.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp tax when they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp tax when they buy property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans
The move will neutralize the success of Corbin's attempt to draw young voters
The seal tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to collect up to £120 million a year — to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when they buy property in the UK – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an effort to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and to target high-cost workers.
The seal tax increase will be lifted on individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United States, with the extra money that the government’s plans will help to counter portlessness.
The added tax — which is outside the current seal tax — may be up to three percent of the higher levels set up two years ago on second houses and houses purchased for rent.
The Treasury expects the move to bring up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of new London properties are purchased by non-UK citizens who boost prices and make it more difficult for first buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many well-being areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become "spook villages" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in seal tax to help more young people to own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by digging land, but not using it, and encouraged Ms. May to make a distance from quotas on affordable houses to repair Britain's "home-run disaster".
Mr. Corbyn announced a striking series of proposed housing improvements, including rental management and an end to "no-errors".
He also wants to give advice more power to build new homes.
Ms. May said, "Last year I said I will dedicate my first ministry to restoring the British dream – that life must be better for every new generation.
And this means restoring our fragile home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build a life.
But it can’t be as easy for individuals who do not live in the United States as for foreign - based companies to buy homes as for hard - working British residents.
For too many people the dream of house ownership has become a distant dream, and the humiliation of portlessness has become too great a reality."
Jack Ross: 'My greatest ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become the driver of Scotland at some point.
The Scottish, 42, enjoys the challenge of blowing up new life in the North-East, which is now in the third place in Liga One, three points below the tops.
He moved this summer to the Stadium of Light after returning last season to the Scottish Prime Minister.
"I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I picked up the second team, but it was already," Ross told the BBC Scotland Sports Sound.
"But I often watched as a child with my father for Scotland at Hampden and it was something that drew me back.
However, the opportunity can only come if I'm successful with club management."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he felt no fear of imitating such established names at such a large club, after he had previously shown suggestions from Barnesley and Ipswich Town out of hand.
"At the moment will success be measured for me by ''can I return this club to the Prime Minister's league?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it certainly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably just think of myself as a success if I can get the club back there."
Ross’s career in management is only three years, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts’ staff.
He then helped Alloa return from religion to the third league and converted St. Mirren from on the edge of religion to champions of the Championship title in the next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever felt during his performance at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroad," he said as he thought back on how he took Alloa's smiles.
"I really believed the administration was the right place for me, even more than to play.
It sounds funny, because I did well enough, made a reasonable existence out of it, and lived reasonable altitudes.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you need to come through weekly.
I keep going through the stress and pressure of the job, but driving just feels right.
I always wanted to drive and now I do it, it feels the easiest I've been in my own skin all my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 nm on a Saturday, found recording
The summer heat wave improved Britain’s hard - earned crowns, but it put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking places and groups saw sales in July with 2.7% saw a rise – but receptions in restaurants were down by 4.8 percent, showing figures.
Peter Martin, of the business consulting firm CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "Sunny sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that Julie followed a similar pattern than last month, June, when drinking places were up by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8 percent in restaurant trade in June only worsened in July.
Drink-led drinking places and crevices have done far better and increased more than what restaurants have fallen.
Food-led drinking places also suffered in the sun, but not as bad as restaurant operators.
It looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Around controlled cows and drinking places, sales increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, with food cut off by three per cent."
Paul Newman, of the leisure and hospitality analyst RSM said: "These results continue the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sports events remains the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-the-home-out market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 per cent per year will be particularly difficult above and besides constant cost pressure.
The long warm summer could not have come at a worse time for food-led operators, and only time would show whether the more moderate temperatures that we have experienced since August would bring the necessary relief."
Total growth in sales around drinking places and restaurants, including new places that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in trade recognitions.

One of five children has secret social media accounts that they hide for their parents
One of five children – some as young as 11 – has secret social media accounts they hide for their parents and teachers, revealing a recording
Recording of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "insta-blads"
The news raised fears that sexual content should be placed
Twenty percent of students say they have a "head report" to show parents
One of five children — some as young as 11 — creates social media accounts that keep them secret for adults.
A survey of 20,000 high-school students revealed rapid growth in "false Insta accounts" – a reference to the photographer Instagram.
The news raised fears that sexual content would be placed.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean head bill to show parents, but they also had private accounts.
A mother who came down to her 13-year-old daughter's secret yard found a teenager who encouraged others to "seek" her.
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistress' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them admitting that they have private accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said, "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be "vote for athletes" on Scottish Athletic Council
Elid Doyle was elected to the council of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body's general annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated job and field detail and President Ian Beattie described the step as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilith has great respect for the Scottish, the UK and the world's athletic community and we're sure athletics in Scotland will benefit much from what she brings to the advice," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm eager to act as a voice for athletes myself and hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 games in Atlanta under his four gold Olympic medals, is now a regular BBC expert, could not run after he had a short - term ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago, I had a stroke.
I could not walk.
Doctors said that only time would teach me or that I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but it was completely restored, learning again how to walk and do practical exercises today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Borsuppad version comparing mothers to cows divided opinions online
A Borspom company shared opinions online with an advertisement comparing breast-feeding mothers to cows that are milked.
In celebration of the launch of what is called the "world's first silent portable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released a tongue-in-the-choice music video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom that the pump gives to mothers who milk out.
Four right moms dance in a bowl full of straw and cows at the size of a song that includes lilys like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you can't see a tail" and "If you haven't seen it, it's not eggs, it's my breasts."
The choir part reads, "Spring it out, pump it out, I run the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
But the advertisement published on the company’s Facebook page caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received a mixed response from viewers, with many who say it subjugates the "graves" of the silk industry.
"Very weak decision to use cows to advertise this product.
If we have to become pregnant and give births to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.

Another observed: "Explainably traumas for mother and baby.
But yes, why doesn't it use to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can't keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "The ad is so out of touch."
Others defended the ad, with one woman who admitted that the song was for her "screams."
"I think it's a great idea.
I would have had one if I were still a baby.
To get milk just made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little bit trick, but I accepted it for what it is.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another person noticed: "This is a nice announcement directed to mothers who are milking out (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cows."
It is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the silk industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discreet pump in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign was based on the insight that many women who are lactating say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is dead-style, has no strings or tubes and just discreetly in a food bridge that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they're milking.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD at Mother noted: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a big and exhausting announcement.
By drawing a parallel between women who are milking and sewing cows, we wanted to put the milking process and all its challenges into the collage, while we're in a fun way that people can connect to the wonderful feeling of freedom that will bring the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has picked up the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the run for designer Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children move style to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply although monthly border agencies have remained relatively unchanged, in part because of poor rhetoric and policies imposed by the Trump administration that make it more difficult to place children at home.
Traditionally, most citizens were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country would be compromised by moving forward to demand a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential citizens and other adult members of their households should leave their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of Immigration and Customs Management, testified to the Congress that the agency arrested thousands of people who applied to provide unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"Almost 80 percent of the individuals who are citizens or family members of citizens are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal aliens.
That is why we continue to persecute those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to process the children more quickly, officials set up new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of arrest, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to hide-and-seekers.
Many will appear through videoconferencing, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status at an immigration right.
Those who are considered unfit for relief will be quickly deported.
The longer the children stay in custody, the more likely it is that they will become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say those concerns are raised at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs that a child's difficulty is more easily overlooked because of the size.
They added that moving the children to the tent village without giving them enough time to emotionally prepare to tell friends in public can exacerbate the trauma that is already very difficult.
Syria tells the U.S., French and Turkish 'occupational forces' to withdraw immediately
When he addressed the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism and will be "handling in accordance".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said to the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, with millions who have been kidnapped, is "amply past".
He said Damascus will continue "to carry on this holy battle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has trained and advised some 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were in order for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "unreasonable fears which encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returnees," he said.
"They're policing something that just needs to be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebellion of Idlib, created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement rejected a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear sprites" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including soldiers of the Al-Qaeda-connected Nusra Front who would be "pulled out."
UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to establish a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said that the panel's work should be limited to the "recognition of the articles of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump would win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the election in 2020, unless, as many liberally likely hope, a state of accusations and scandals will soon end his presidency.
In which no doubt "the most dramatic finals of a presidency will ever be!"
Until now, there are no signs of visual impairment.
Since 2014, peak clocks have doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million peak viewers, up to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is top of cable nuisances with as many as 3.5 million viewers.
"It's a fire that people are attracted to, because it's not something we understand," says Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress Building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Five Hard Truths About Snaging Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'For he has made me laugh,' said I. Scovell to me.
There is a value of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on the TV, the stories coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families, and the health of the world economy.
To turn it off is a luxury that can cost only the most privileged viewers.
And yet it goes further than being just an informed citizen when you're in the sixth hour to watch a panel of experts debate on Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 volt-student flying pool ("a clothing piece thick of the hubris", The Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"Partly what he does to make it feel like a reality program is that he feeds you every night," says Brent Montgomery, the business manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump program's changing role distribution and daily loops in the plot (such as to seek quarrel with N.F.L., Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode, otherwise you stay behind.
When I reached this week for Mr. Fleiss, it was 80 degrees outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was inside looking at MSNBC while he took CNN.
He could not cut himself off, he was not on the way with Brett Kavanaugh to appear before the Senate’s Court of Justice and the future of the Supreme Court hanging on the scale.
"I remember when we did all that crazy program then and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,' said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it seems they were right now."

Extra cash flow to the most exciting medium-term selection race in Home
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th century saw an influx of money, thanks to the movement of convention districts that two officials now ran in a race around the same seat.
The recently changed suburban Pittsburgh district has Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb stands against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, representing the 12th old Pennsylvania district, which is heavily overflew with the new 17th.
The maps were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January determined that the old districts were illegally grounded in favour of the Republics.
The race in the new 17th ended with a field funding competition between the major parties' financial legs, the Democratic Field Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Field Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a nailed victory in a wide - eyed special election in March for Pennsylvania’s 18th Congress district.
The seat was held for more than a decade by a Republican and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats an emotional advantage.
The U.S. considered penalizing El Salvador rather than supporting China, but then reversed
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the company expelled the Trump Organization's board of directors.
State Department officials decided to call back the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on "the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, earlier this month in a statement.
However, fines were considered only against El Salvador who received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug management, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, including a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder figures.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level convention and focused on security and economic progress to follow a similar convention last year that was considered a step forward in an attempt to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the congress to continue to effectively end any consideration of El Salvador's fines.
Deputy President Mike Pence was now determined to speak to the congress, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the assembly for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new hard messages or burdens from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal consultation on the condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst who was close to the administration and also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
Study history
The next thing that might happen can be the special discussion of Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible overcrowding of the court, of which there is now very significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller's focus is probably also on whether Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia worked together in the country's attack on our elections.
If the Congress were to go into other hands, Mr. Trump would have to face responsibility in that body, just as he was preparing to go back to the electorate, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peer group.
It's a bunch of aces, so I don't want to let you know that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable – and not those of his equinoxes in Europe.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how much the battle can be calculated.
In 1938 German officials were ready to execute a coup against Hitler, if the West only opposed him and supported the Czech-Slovake at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the slaughter of the years that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the course of democracy is speeded up or slowed down.
Americans now face several such turning points.
What would we do if Mr. Trump, Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, gave thanks to the man who controlled Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein was in hot water since this newspaper reported that he proposed last year to take up the president in secret and speculated whether he was qualified for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
"How will we react to this if the newly requested FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of credible charges of sexual assault and unfair testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the election for a convention that will hold Mr. Trump responsible?
If we watch those tests, there's a long winter for democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi power who once lived in my ambassador's house.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to burn Sabbath candles on that table that carried the washing machine.
With it as my origin, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistics for Rapid Vienna Battle
Rangers play Thursday guests for Rapid Vienna knowing that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive match-off in Spain against Villareal earlier this month, will place them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the European League.
A knee injury has prevented middle-field player Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2nd anniversary of the Villareal attack, but he believes Rangers can use this output as a escape spot for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villareal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the conviction that we could get something and walked away with a point.
Maybe we could have won it at the end, but a comparison is probably a fair outcome.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday is another great European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a difficult match, because they had a good outcome in their last match, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can get through and get a positive outcome.
Last year was certainly hard, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but now there's a well-being factor in place.
The group is good, and the men enjoy it, and the training is good.
Hopefully we can now pass through, last season behind us sit and be successful."
Women Lost Sleeping Over These Deprived Savings
Despite the fact that surveyors have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk about it to their relatives.
About half the individuals in the Nationalwide study said they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent said that they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, a fish president of the National Life Insurance Business.
Here's the truth to start.
Speak to your spouse and the children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not express your wishes long before the time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to get care, as those choices can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come forward with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term funding decisions can include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash-life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own capabilities – as long as you have the money.
Perform your legal documents: Cut the legal battles at the pass.
Get a health care agency instead so you show a trusted individual to monitor your medical care and make sure that experts meet your wishes if you can't communicate.
Consider, too, your finances.
You should choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid if you are not competent.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Play those details in a written plan so you're ready.
"It's not just the financial issues that are concerned, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What is the medicine?
Who will care for the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
One shot several times in Ilfracombe with windmills
A man was shot several times with a windbow when he walked home after a night.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place against about 02:30 BST, as "a possible action".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries were not life - threatening, and the police asked witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu Friday, officials said, and the mortality rate is expected to rise.
With communication out of action, relief officers could not get any information from Dongala Regency, an area north of Palu which is near the centre of the 7.5-wide barrier.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to safety after the disaster.
Here are some key events about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the point of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with a estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit them.
Dongala is a regency that stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regent, an administrative area under a province, had a estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the support pillars of the Central-Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal area of Dongalla.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is usually concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times over the past 100 years by tsunamis, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also struck West Dongala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the Seismic Pacific Ocean’s Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major crackdown along the western coast of the Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December, leading to a tsunami that hit 14 countries, led to 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong shells hit the west coast of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds died in Nias Island, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6,8-range hit the south of Java, Indonesia was the most populous island, leading to a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6-wide earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of the Wes-Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-wide crash struck one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, which led to a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozen villages and led to about 300 deaths.
2016: A level of shock struck the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
It didn't lead this time to a tsunami, but more than 100 are dead because of the fallen buildings,
2018: Great shocks hit Indonesia’s tourist island Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily beached.
Sarah Palin’s eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and fishing presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report issued by Alaska State police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he dropped a female knowledge phone with her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Pre-trial Facility and is continued on a $500 insurance guarantee, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "innocent, certainly" when asked what he complained, reported the network.
Palin stands for three classes of A violations in the face, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and fine $250 000.
He's also charged with a class B violation, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal complaints against Palin have been filed.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The matter is now before Alaska’s Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possessed a firearm while he was drunk, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed to have boxed her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by vet groups after connecting her son’s behavior to PTSD as a result of his duty in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-wide earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been set off with death figures expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside the central Sulavesi, northeastern Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors are looking for rare death sentences for suspects in NYC earthquake attacks
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City earthquake that has caused eight people's deaths – a rare penalty that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a Home Depot rental engine to launch an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side highway in Laer Manhattan to harvest pedestrians and a biker in his path in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "consciously" killed the eight victims and "consciously" suffered serious physical injuries, according to the notice of intention to ask for the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of those charges bring possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal major jury struck Saipov with 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder in favour of repression, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a complaint of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "deep planning and preconceivedness", said prosecutors, and described the way in which Saipov carried it out as "atrocious, cruel and perverse".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," stated the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the South District of New York was prosecuted for a death sentence.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug dealers, but finally, in September 2009 he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York, in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being sentenced to a plot to commit espionage to the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were arrested with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Shaipov, a native of Uzbekistan, didn't repent in the days and months following the attack, according to the law of the court.
He mentioned to investigators that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also requested to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He pleaded innocently on the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro deo lawyers representing Saipov, said that they were "naturally disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to desire the death penalty rather than to accept a guilt confession to life imprisonment with no possible release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved." Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked persecutors not to desire the death penalty.
Tory LP says NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in control of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage made a vow today to mobilize "the people's army" during a protest at the Tory Conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to feel the "hot" of Eurosceptic – as one of Theresa May's own LPs suggested he had to be in control of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative background banker Peter Bone told March in Birmingham that by the time the UK was "sudden" as Mr. Farage Brexit secretary.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faces to unite her deep-separated officers by calling for pro-Roman Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime challenge is to maintain its Chequers compromise plan in the midst of attacks by Brexitiers, Remainers and the EU.
The allies insisted that she would press the door in her attempt to agree with Brussels in spite of the death march – and Eurosceptic and Labour forced her to choose between package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone said to the Loop Mark Loop convention in Solihull that he wanted to "evict the Chequers".
He proposed that Mr Farage should have been made an noble man and be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he were in control, we would have been out by the time,' he said.
The Wellingborough-LP added, 'I'll get up for Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.'
He expressed his opposition to the EU and said: "We did not fight world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr. Bone pointed out that since the 2016 vote, public opinion has changed: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their mind and wish to remain completely uncertain.’
Tory Brexiter Andrea Jenkyns was also in March and told reporters: ‘ I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular with some of us and our activists who actually bomb the streets and make sure that we are selected in the first place.
Please let Chequers go and start listening.'
In a direct message to Mrs. May, she added: ‘First ministers must keep their jobs when they keep their promises.’
Mr. Colore told us that the convention politicians had to feel the "hot" if they were on the threshold to violate the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
'It's about a matter of confidence between us--the people--and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we won't let you get away with it.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
‘We mobilize the people’s strength of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-regulatory, proud United Kingdom.’
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour convention in the city center.
A few activists went to Tories against Brexit banners to announce the group this weekend.
Labourer Lord Adonis ridiculed the conservatives for the security issues they endured with a party application like the conference opened.
"It's the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus in place, for the uninterrupted border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
'It's a total mess.
There is not such a thing as a good Brexit,' he added.
Warren plans to look hard at it to stand for the president
U.S. Sen Elizabeth Warren says she'll "look hard to stand for the president" at the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts-Democrat spoke about her future at a city hall meeting in western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, stands for re-election in November against GOP, Rep Geoff Diehl, co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She is already in the midst of speculation that her Trump may be challenging in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Hollywood was her 36th meeting with constitutors using the city hall format since Trump was under control.
A companion asked her if she was planning to stand for the president.
Warren replied that it was time "for women to go to Washington to correct our broken government, and it closes in a woman quite above."
Arrested in the shooting of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA., announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m.. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying a man seen in the image material.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University.
"Wayde Sims had a gunshot wound in his head and was finally killed as a result of it," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media by 247 sports Saturday.
Wayde entered to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene, owned a weapon, and admitted that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 races last season and held an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 jumping balls per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton blinks world title after team commands gave him his victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment that Valteri Bottas qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday when Mercedes' team commands would play a major role in the events.
From the pole position, Bottas had a good start and won almost for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first entered the wells, and Hamilton left to ride behind in the bundle in the traffic, something that had to be decisive.
The Mercedes came a round later and came out behind Bethel, but Hamilton went forward to wheel-on-wheel action that the Ferrari driver, counter-intentionally risk-free the inner view, left at risk of delaying a double-movement to defend on the third corner.
Max Steppen began from the back row of the road route and was seventh toward the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led to a large part of the series as he held to his bands to quickly finish and cross Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He may have entered the wells at the 44th round but could not speed up his pace in the remaining eight rounds, since Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valteri had done great weekends and was a real gentleman.
The team did outstanding work to have one-two," said Hamilton.
It was a real bad lifting language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein at an assembly on her insistence that she did not deliver Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused the Supreme Court of sexual assault, named Brett Kavanaugh.
The president spoke at a convention in West Virginia and did not directly address the testimony Ford gave before the Senate Committee. Instead, he commented that what was said in the Senate indicated that people were "common and unscrupulous and liars".
"The one thing that may happen and the nice thing that has happened in the Senate over the past few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and common and lying," he said.
"When you look at explanations and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you lick it?
Remember her answer... you drew the document-- oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't lick it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we lick it... no, we didn't lick it," he added, in a preface of the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter that filed the allegations back in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was earlier in September that Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations. I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But the president did not respect her denial and commented during the Saturday evening convention: "I tell you what.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst lifting language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court-recognised accused of sexual misconduct by three women and suggested that the Democrats use the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back with any necessary means.
You see the community, the inequity, they don't give up on who they hurt, who they have to worry about getting power and control," the president said the media reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer cast two targets for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars reconciled Friday’s Elite League’s loss against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 match in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-way lead by throwing from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team together before Dwyer restored the Giants ’ leadership.
Francois Bouchard brought Dundee to the fore before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen-targets determined their victory.
It was the third Elite League victory of the season for Adam Keefe’s men who had lost their first match and when Friday night won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
This was the fourth convention of the season between the sides, with the Giants who won the previous three matches.
Dwyer's opening ball came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull-help, with David Rutherford who had the help when Beauvilier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back to play at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the supplier for Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer surely made the Giants take the lead in the first break when he threw his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard found their match again with a force target at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran agreed to help Nielsen to let Dundee lead for the first time in the game in the second half and made sure of winning with his team’s fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants who have now lost four of their last five matches are home to Milton Keynes in their next match Friday.
Air traffic controller dying to secure hundreds of aircraft can escape earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is viewed as a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people rose safely.
More than 800 people are dead and more are missing after a great earthquake on Friday hit the island of Sulavesi, causing a tsunami.
There are still strong shocks in the area, and many have been caught in wreckage in the city of Palu.
But in spite of his colleagues who fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agang refused to leave his post in the control tower that swooped heavily on the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained unmoved to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the run, was able to rise safely.
He then jumped off the traffic control when he daydreamed it together.
He later died in the hospital.
Speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, says that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia’s ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts broke to hear of this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll may reach the thousands with the country’s disaster relief agency, which says that access to the villages of Dongala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the mortality rate is still rising as many bodies are still under construction while many cannot be reached," said agent spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves that reached about six feet [6 m] have blown Palu to keep a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News, "Every minute you bring in an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce.
The minimarks are plowed all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Rooic Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Rooic Cross seeks to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military service: "I ask you to work day and night to complete every task related to disarmament.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Micronesian aircraft accident: Air Niugini says now one man is being avoided after a beach accident
The airline that handled a flight that fell into a Pacific beach in Micronesia now says that one man was missing after they had previously said that all 47 passengers and crew safely cleared the sinking plane.
Air Niguini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not account for a male passenger.
The air force said that they were working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The air traffic controller did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while it tried to land at the Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The air force said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airfield and the U.S. fleet both said that the plane landed near the runway in the beach.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane had come very low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to walk through the middle of the water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the air vessels had panicked and screamed and that he had caused a small head injury.
The U.S. fleet said that creatures who worked near the improvement of a key also helped with a lifeboat to land people on land before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered aircraft in the last two decades, but Air Niugini was involved in one.
Analyst sets out time line from the night that woman was burned alive
The state closed its case on Saturday in the retrial of a man charged with burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used phone records to gather the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night he died.
Rowlett said that he received location data from different phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's dress that night, Sanford said, "Look, because my dress was in Nashville."
A little inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when he was dead.
Phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a little after Chambers' death, Tellis Chambers deleted messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He had her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense was scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative look of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop moved away from its origin of political messages and the handling of social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common saw a recent revolution in the United States by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Pretty black person?!
New Child's Woman is a couple of days away because she's down to "racistie" text
A New York youth woman reported a couple for discrimination after receiving a wrong address message from the mother who complained that she was "a pretty black person."
The couple deny that they're racist and compare the matter to "pression."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was upset when she found out that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"New Zealand NÓG A black person," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to me twice.
After she found her mistake, a "uneasy" Plasco-Flaxman thanked me Maurice and said that their outgoing African-American infant wife did bad work and that she had rather expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent to a Uber house.
Now Maurice is the party for damages on the decommissioning and seeks his compensation to the amount of $350 per day for the six months, resident work for which she was originally appointed, although it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do such good," she told the post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple returned to the claims that they were racist and said that it was the reasonable thing to end Maurice’s submission and feared that they would not be able to trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a race.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were rude, even though it was out of sight?
Your first father?
Come on."
Plasco compared the matter to "pressing" and said that his wife would have a baby in two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going after such a person?
It's not a very nice thing to do," the investment banker added.
As the case continues, the court of public opinion was quick to bring the couple on social media and cut them off for their behavior and logic.
A new letter revealed that Paddington's publishers were afraid that a talking bear wouldn't connect readers.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book, said about the letter, "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very entertaining to know about Paddington's great success."
She said her father would have been hot if his work had been rejected. He was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book on the little toys. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release after his death last year was "bitter-sweet."
About Paddington, whom she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
"He was quite a quiet man and he wasn't an orange-eyed man," she said.
"But because Paddington was really for him, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something: you were proud of them, even though it was not your job.
I think he saw Paddington’s success in that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the honour to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say hello to the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was hunted to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2-hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that it was right wrong, that they did not expect her to do it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I received the call from Nad to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I had to greet her.
And I have.
I said, "Tashi, I'm very fond of you, heartlam.
I will soon be with you.
I will be with you.
The medication the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating was slowly touching up and leaving her system.
She was a while before she died, and the body was closing.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was like a detachment.
I couldn't cry or cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep it together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who had been hurt by the loss of her daughter at the time, accompanied the other passengers aboard the plane - unaware of the test she had been appreciating.
"No one knew," she said.
"I shook my head and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the run I got an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women post cards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey's mail cards have been on a Welsh bridge for a while with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Me Davis’s son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself on the 18th.
"I want no parent to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Davis, 45, lived in Lydney, and said that her son was a promising leader with a loud smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile had brightened any room."
But he gave up work before he was dead, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11, found his brother after he took his own life.
Davis said to me, "I am constantly worried that there will be a domino effect."
Me Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there to whom you can go and to whom you can talk, even though it is a friend.
Don't sit still - you need to talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old husband, not long after his mother's death.
"He did not say that he felt sick or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the lowest point on Christmas -- when the children opened their gifts, he did not contact their eyes or do anything with them."
She said her death was very traumatic to them, but that they had to work through it: "This time a hole through the family.
This breaks us up.
But we must all go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh’s future has yet to be investigated by the FBI
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked--a timeless investigation that didn't work--we might bring a little unity," said Mr. Flake Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee was falling apart under the most shimmering of partitions.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want to set up the FBI investigation?
Their contradiction is all due to time calculations.
The elections are only weeks away, on November 6, if, as it is expected, the Republics go badly, then they will be severely weakened in their efforts to find the man they want to go to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House, who met his wife Ashley through him and was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI issues its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republics and 49 Democrats are sitting today.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can come to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor which will allow Mike Pence, the President of the fish, to break up a play of equality and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea running numbers 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korean warriors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-one seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-sought quoted data from the South's unitary cabinet and said that last year there were 1,127 crossings - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said more stringent border control between North Korea and China and higher prices demanded by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
The vast majority of runners from the North are finally offered South Korea citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flights through Shina, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMS) between the two Koreans.
Shina views the warriors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, often repatriating with violence.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically speaking in war with one another, have greatly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks that focused on the ongoing negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons.
It came to the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to work together for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho has blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since Saturday.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the UN General Meeting in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histories," says he is unable to serve at the Supreme Court.
Home Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "histories" and said that he was temporarily unable to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi delivered the comment in a interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had ever acted like this, they would say 'histories'," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate judicial committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at times he screamed and sneered while discussing his family and his high school for years.
He also explicitly rejected Democrats on the committee and called the claims against him a "might and coordinated murder of character," organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court because it showed that he was prejudiced against Democrats.
"I think he is incompetent with those statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to sue Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats won the majority in the Laerhaus.
"I'll say it -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not competent to be at the Supreme Court, but to be at the court where he is now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Ommangang Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that she was concerned as a Democrat about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Law on affordable care or Roe v. Wade as he was considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation proceedings, Kavanaugh skipped questions about whether he would reverse certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'It's not wonderful,' said Pelosi.
And women have to handle it.
It is a righteous diaphragm, months, and years' anger that boils over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She went on, "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive officer, whoever said that she wept when she got angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and began to cry, she would tell the person she was talking to, "You may think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tranes are allowed as a partial output for tomatoes because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early job in a man-dominated office is where I once found that I cried with nameless anger and was caught by my neck by an older woman--a cold driver for whom I was a little afraid--who dragged me into a reportal.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think that you are sad, and will rejoice, because they have had an effect on you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart in an out-of-court relationship called Monkey Business was invented and he had to leave the revolutions, Shreeder, very frustrated me, realized that there was no reason she could not investigate the idea that she could run for the president.
"I didn't think well of the decision," she said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves".
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with founders and so she made a vow that she wouldn't enter the races unless she had collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would only give her $250.
"Do they think I get fired?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not lead a formal campaign, she was overcome by emotions--thanks to the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and to target voters rather than delegates, and angry for sexism--that she laughed.
You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder called me about how the press responded to her.
"You would have thought that Kleinex was my corporate guarantee.
I remember thinking, what are they going to sit on my gravestone?
"She cried?"
How the U.S. trade war may be good for Beijing
The opening alvos of the trade war between the US and China were overwhelming, and while the battle is over, a disagreement between the countries may be beneficial in the long term for Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, first warned earlier this year by charging important Chinese executions, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week’s most interesting escalation has resulted in an increase of $200 billion (£150 billion) and an effective half of the goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing took every time in goods reprisals and recently priced from five to ten percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has promised to equalize the US shoot-by-shoot and the world's largest economy is not going to move soon.
To get Washington to stand back means to surrender to requests, but to meet in public the US's requests will be too much of a embarrassment to Xi Jinping, China's President.
Experts still say that if Beijing is playing its cards right, printing on US trade war over the long-term China can support positively by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that can start an economic toll in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than viewers have previously known," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia in the middle of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and calls for help to rebuild the land that has been destroyed by war for more than seven years.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country improve.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have made their daily lives and their existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian people have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the plainsland.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that had contributed to the invasion.
Europe Marks Ryder Becker Winning in Paris
Spain Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and Spain U.S.A. with a final point from 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn’s team picked up the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
US-star Phil Mickelson, who had failed most of the tournament, had his T-hold in the water at the par-3 16th hole and gave his match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has been blind in all its rounds and has become one of the 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown out by the player with the lowest rank on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The player with the world’s highest rank, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to land Paulter from England who may have played in his final Ryder cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder beakers, Spanjaard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament’s European winner of all times with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a tough year.
So grateful for Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I am so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He hands over the box to his countrymate John Ram who won a few games on Sunday US-collapse Tiger Woods 2+1.
The incredible pride that I feel, to win Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at dai old," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods has lost four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 racetrack Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics by one of the greatest players of all time and he won 14 great titles second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team U.S.A. has been struggling to find the cleaning field with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau who played high-calibre golf all over the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance on behalf of his team: "I am proud of these servants. They fought.
There was a time this morning when we were putting a little heat on Europe.
We deleted it.
The height of Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 servants, and I am proud to serve as their captain.
You have to keep your hat clean.
We are superior."
