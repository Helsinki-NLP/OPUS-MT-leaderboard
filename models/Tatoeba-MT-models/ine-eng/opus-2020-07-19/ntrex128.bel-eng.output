Valiant additional deputies are concerned that they look like Marines.
Some Members do not understand why their status should be changed to the "member of the Wells Parliament".
The MPs were upset about the plans to change the name of the local east to the name "Parliament Wells."
Members of all political views think it's a disgrace.
One member of the team said his colleagues were concerned that it was rhyming with the words "stupid" and "stupid."
For readers outside Wells: In the Welsh language, twp means "stupid," and pwp means "stupid."
The deputy said that her group was not entirely satisfied and suggested alternatives.
The Valiant conservators said their group was ready to discuss the change in the name of the East, but noted that it was a short verbal transition from a member of the Valiant Parliament to the Marines.
In this context, the waly letter in w speaks the same thing as the yorkshire English letter u.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently developing a draft law on the amendment of the name, made a statement: "The final decision on any description of what Members of the House call, of course, will be the issue of members themselves."
The Wells government law since 2017 gives the Welsh East the right to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a national consultation on the proposals that have been widely supported to call the East to the Wells Parliament.
With regard to the title of an additional deputy, the Commission has given the Members of Parliament Wells or the CPU the most important support during public consultations.
Additional MPs obviously suggest alternative variants, but the way to reach consensus can be a major pain to seniority, Elaine Jones, who is supposed to be presenting a bill on changes over a few weeks.
Reform policy will also include other changes in the work of the Assembly, such as the rules on disqualification of additional members and changes in committee structure.
Additional Members shall vote in final terms on what they should be called when they are doing their preliminary work.
Macedonians refer to a reference for changing country names
On Sunday, voters are calling for a change in the name of their country on or against the Republic of North Macedonia.
National voting was organised to resolve a multiannual issue with neighbouring Greece, which has its own area called Macedonia.
In Athens for a long time, they insisted that the name of their North Neighbor represents a claim on their territory that prevented Macedonia's involvement and friendship with the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
President George Ivanov of Macedonia, a referendum on the change of name, said he would not take part in the vote.
But the proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, claim that the change of name is simply a cost that must be paid for entry into the EC and the North Atlantic Alliance.
Named temple of St. Martin's silence, churches in Harlem fight for existence
"Before, as the old people I spoke to were talking to, there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today there's neither one nor the other."
He said that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People have different attitudes and feelings at present," he said.
"The bars are no longer the warm local guesthouses where people go constantly."
As for the churches, he was concerned that the money from the sale had been active for as long a period as the leaders expected, and sooner or later they would return to where they had started.
Churches, he added, can be replaced by living women with kandaminiums, filled with people who will not help the temple that will remain in the area.
"The vast majority of people who buy candamines in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore it will speed up the day when these churches close together, because it is unlikely that the majority of people who move into these candamines will be adopted by these churches."
Both churches were built by a group of white before Garlem became a black area – the Church of St. Martin in 1870, the Church of St. Martin in ten years.
The first white Methodist community left in the 1930s.
The black community, which was about to pray, got the property to the building.
The Church of St. Martin was captured by a black-eyed community under the leadership of John Howard Johnson, who had appointed a bunch of traders on the main trade in Harlem 125th Street, where they refused to hire or ask for black-skinners.
The fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but the returnedmen under father Johnson's leadership planned a reconstruction: they took up the operation of the corals.
Similar to David Johnson, father Johnson's son, and any successor to St. Martin's Church, he proudly called the coral "poor people".
The expert who was playing on the coral in July called it "Cultural Treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical tool".
The expert at Tiffany Ng from Michigan University also noted that it was the first coral in the world to be played by black-sucked musician Dianius A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to a larger coral in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriveser said that in the Church of Saint Martin had not replaced him.
What happened in St. Martin's Church in the last few months was a complicated story between architects and subcontractors, some of whom were attracted by false church leaders, others by eparthia.
The focus of the believers -- the governing body of the income, consisting of the chaplain's assistants -- was written in a campaign in July with a caution that the competition "trys to translate expenditure" into the focus of the believers, although the focus was not involved in the recruitment of architects and advisors to whom the event was sent.
Some natives complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the eparchy.
The shark wounded a 13-year-old boy during the shooting of a bullfight in California.
On Saturday, the shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy who was hunting at the lobby in California on the day of the opening of the season.
The attack took place about 7 o'clock in the morning near the Bacon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hemel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he was dealing with the dawing with his friends for half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then he swam with the others to help get him out of the water.
Hemel at first thought it was a mere excitement from hunting the Lobsters, but then he realized that something bad had happened: "I was bitten!
They bit me!"
"All his key was broken," said Hemel, adding that he noticed it when he came to the boy.
I cried out to everyone out of the water, "In the water near the shark!" added Hemel.
The boy was transported by air to the baby hospital Reidy in San Diego, where he was in critical condition.
The variety of sharks that have been attacked is unknown.
The rescuer Captain Larry Giles reported on the media briefing that the shark had been observed in this place a few weeks earlier, but was determined that it was a safe diversion.
Giles added that the suffering had been damaged by the upper part of the board.
Soldiers closed their way to the beach from Ponta-Bich in Kasabilad to Svamy in Esinitas for 48 hours to conduct research and safety.
Giles noted that in this area more than 135 species of sharks live, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plans to move to the British beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to work with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams, opening sections with beauty cargoes in the universe where trained specialists will work.
As a result of a significant increase in the British beauty market, with an estimated 2.8 billion pounds of sterling that continues to grow, while the volume of sales of fashion clothing and household goods decreases, more huge beauty houses will be represented in 11 salons throughout the country and also in other new salons next year, which demonstrate success.
The investment in beauty comes because supermarkets are looking for a way to fill the place on the shelf that had previously been occupied by televisions, microwaves, and furniture for the house.
Sainsbury's said to double the amount of beauty products, offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which appear first.
An existing assortment from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in firm departments like what can be found in stores like Boots.
Major stores are also relaunching their cosmetics store, so most products will fit for vegans, and this trend becomes increasingly demanding among young buyers.
Besides, Fragrance Shop's perfume shop will test a concussion in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which opened last week in Croedan on the south of London, and the second opens in Sale-Ouk (Birmingham) at the end of this year.
Buying online and going to buy small quantities of products every day in local stores around the house will lead to more efforts being made by the supermarket to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Cupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, said the trading points would be more and more similar to the universe, because a network of supermarkets is trying to compete with Aldi's dissidents, Lidl with the help of a large number of services and non-cash goods.
Sainsbury's placed Argo's trading points in hundreds of stores, and also placed a few Habitats points from the time that two years ago acquired both networks that, in his words, supported the growth of the sale of food and made the acquisition more profitable.
The previous attempt by supermarkets to reconstitute their beauty departments and monkeys has not ended successfully.
Sainsbury's was a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the attempt to share revenues from the pharmacies ended after a number of divorces in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after three years ago, Sainsbury's sold its optical business together with 281 Celesio stores to the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy for 125 million pounds of sterling.
It was stated that Lloyds played his role in this plan, expanding the range of delicious brand-garden care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hex, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the appearance of our beauty salons to improve the conditions for our customers.
We've also invested in teaching our employees to offer their recommendations.
Our brand range is designed in the light of any needs, and the attractive location and convenient location make us a better home of beauty to resist the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones was disbanded after Holly Willowby refused to pay 11 million pounds of sterling.
Dragons Den Peter Jones was disillusioned after the TV lobby Willowby refused to trade for 11 million pounds of sterling with his brand, which specializes in the image of life, to focus on their new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
In Willowbie there is no time for branding goods for home and accessories True.
Business couples became like a brand of Guinea's Peltrow Goop.
This morning the 37-year-old leader told Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willowby left the Dragon's Den Peter Jones star, which is now falling apart with his business of making brand clothes to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The source reports that Jones was disillusioned when the golden girl of television admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow (Bakingemshire), her new transactions up to 1.5 million pounds of Sterling means that she will no longer have enough time to deal with home cargo and accessories of the brand True.
The business was similar to the brand of Guinea's Peltrow Goop and was doubled twice to double Willowby's profits by 11 million pounds of sterling.
When 37-year-old Willowbie announced in Instagram that she was leaving True, Jones flew out of the United Kingdom and headed into one of his accommodations.
The source of the message: True was the main priority of Holly.
It was her long-term future, which she would see in a couple of decades.
Her decision to refuse left all the participants utterly devastated.
No one wanted to believe what was happening on Tuesday, very soon had to start dinner.
Marlow's headquarters has a warehouse full of goods ready for sale.
Experts suggest that the care of the leader of this Morning, who enters the number of the most important British stars, can cost the company millions because of the huge investments in different camps, from pillows and candles to clothing and household goods, as well as because of the possible further delays with their practice.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of Queen Willowbie and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Kapp, for ten years.
Willowby founded True & Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the headquarters in March.
The couple rest together, and Jones owns a 40-percent part of the Baldwin TV company.
Willowby is a representative of the M&S brand and replaces Father McPartlin as the leading ITV "I'm a celebrity".
Last night the source, near Jones, said, "We won't comment on his affairs."
A sincere conversation "after which we fell in love"
He gave up on the criticism he received from the mass media for his commentary, which is considered as "unpresidential" because it is always about the North Korean leader.
Why does President Trump refuse much?
Trump said to his lucky "dictaric" voice.
"I don't deny anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after the first meeting in June in Singapore was announced by Trump as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the talk about denuclearization went on and on and on.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, the leading North Korean diplomat Lee Ann Ho declared to the world leader at the AAN General Assembly on Saturday that the North was not expected to be the "relevant West" of the United States in response to the previous steps of North Korea in the area of disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out that the United States continues to apply sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
The trumpet took a much more optimistic position in its direction.
"We are very successful in building relationships with North Korea," he said.
"Everything could have ended with a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim led to positive results: the completion of missile tests, the release of hostages, and the return of American troops at home.
And he defended his unusual approach in talking about relationships with Kim.
"Being on the President's side is very easy, but instead of 10,000 people trying to penetrate this crowded arena, we'll already have about 200 people there," said Trump, pointing to the crowd right in front of them.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the islands, killed hundreds of people.
For example, after the earthquake on W. Lambok's alien organization said they were unnecessary.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lamboc's population had been relocated, there was no national disaster, which is the necessary condition for international assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases it was understood that they were not looking for international help, so it was a bit difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Even though the Children's Education Fund (Save the Children) is collecting a mission to travel to Paul until you understand whether foreign employees can work in places.
Mr. Sutopa, a representative of the National Agency for Combating Sick Disasters, said that the Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Pala, to find out if an international agency would be allowed to provide assistance.
Despite the earthquakes that still survive Indonesia, the country is still well prepared for unexpected nature.
Although in Acheha there were built shelters, in other coastal settlements they hardly had.
The apparent failure of the sirens to warn the noises in Paul led to a large number of casualties, although the warning was.
Even in the best times, moving between many islands of Indonesia was a difficult task.
And stressful disasters have made moving logistics more complicated.
The hospital ship, which was located at the Lambok for treatment of the earthquake, is approaching Pala, but the path to a new place of disaster will take at least three days.
President Joko Odyda has set up his pre-election campaign to improve Indonesia's damaged infrastructure and to spend money on automobile roads and gypsies.
But the lack of funding is after the administration of Joe, because next year there's going to be new choices.
Mr. Joe also faces pressure from the interconfessional tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority are taking more conservative Islam.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were expelled from their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs were whitened in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows and other cold weapons.
See: Daniel Stridge from Liverpool pushes a ball far away against Chelsea.
Daniel Stridge saved Liverpool from Chelsea's death in the Premier-Lise, increasing the number by 89 minutes on Saturday at London's Stemford Bridge.
The Starge received a transmission from Jardan Shakyri when they were about 30 metres from the Chelsea gate, which was 1-0.
He made the find a ball left of himself before making a shot into a distant tent.
The attempt ended when the ball went right at the top of the net.
The sword, as a result, flew over the head of Kepcha Arisaglago, which jumped directly into the net.
"He was just trying to get in this position to hit the ball, and players like Shak always tried to push as far ahead as possible, so I was just trying to win us as much time as possible," Stridge said in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that running Kante made the dog easy, not thinking too much about it, and just hit the ball."
Chelsea went 1:0 at the beginning of the second time after the 25th minute, the Belgian star Eden Azar killed.
Attacking the blues in this match, he made Matthew Kovacic's dog before he returned to the semi-defence zone and ran into half the Liverpool field.
The cat soon found itself in the center of the field.
Then he made an effective blow by handing down the ball to the gate.
Azar ran away from the defense and went down to the lower left corner of the far side of the barn near the guard of Liverpool, Eliza Becker.
Liverpool competes with the "Napali" in the group stage of the Champions League for 3 hours on Wednesday at the San Paul Stadium in Italian Naples.
Chelsea meets with Videoton in the League of Europe at WEFA on Thursday at 3 o'clock in London.
The number of tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of people who died as a result of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832, reported on Sunday morning to the Agency for the Eradication of the Endangered Disasters.
At the press conference, a representative of Sotopa Purvo Nugroho said that, according to the news, many people found themselves trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed as a result of a 7.5-ball earthquake, which took place on Friday and called for a 7-metre high wave.
The city of Pala, in which more than 380,000 people live, was blocked by broken buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after he was killed by a woman.
The murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhede (Mercissoid) this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 07:55 with a severe wound in the Grayson-Museum area on John Street Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for suspected murder.
The police called for their people from this area who saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to address anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhede or who saw or heard anything suspicious, and ask them to contact us.
I also call on everyone, in particular, the taxi driver, video recorders who may have taken away some video, to contact us, because they can have information that is extremely important to our research."
The police representative confirmed that the woman, whose body was found, lived next to Birkenhede and was found in her own house.
Today's friend women came to the scene to ask: where was she found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police said it's in the process of informing the nearest victims.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson-Museum just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He lost his tongue when he learned what had happened.
I'm living right now saying it'll be a few more hours before they let them come back.
The police explained to one person that the whole area is now a crime scene.
The woman cried at the scene.
She said, "It's so terrible."
At 14:00, two police vans were in the fenced perimeter, another van was outside.
Several police officers stood inside the perimeter, investigating a multi-dwelling building.
All the information you have must contact the @MerPolCC police department, call 101 or contact the Criminal Police anonymously on 0800 555 111, calling 247 from 30 September.
The parliamentary statute of Cromwell has become the last century blow in the case of "historic writing".
His removal would be a poetic justice for him like the Taliban's destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts made by his fanatic Puritan followers.
"But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Creek's proposal as "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, the head of the Cromwell Society, said: In the course of the current debate on the demise of the statue, it was inevitable that the memory of Oliver Cromwell near the Westminster Palace would be the object of these acts.
English civil war icons were neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the poor Cromwell will be sacrificed for his ancestors Thomas in the preceding century.
Mr. William Hama Tornikroft's vivid presentation of Cromwell is a witness to the 19th century's ideas and a part of the history of what is happening, which, as many people think, should be respected.
Mr. Goldsmith said The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people know from the end of the 19th century better than they do today, as a advocate of parliament from outside pressure, in his case it was manarchy.
Is this a very accurate presentation, a subject of prolonged historical debates?
There is no doubt that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual cognitive figure that represents one of the sides of this encounter.
His achievements as a Lord-Procurator also deserve to be noted and respected."
The pig-killer has led to the death of a Chinese farmer.
As local media reports, the farmer was attacked and killed by pigs on the market in southwestern China.
"The man, known only by the name of John, was found dead with a broken artery and a yellow blood, near the head of the Lupanish market in the Guizhow province," the newspaper South China Post reported on Sunday.
Swine was ordered to introduce the vaccine in May 30th 2005 in China's Chinese province.
As it is reported, he and his cousin came from the neighbouring province of Junan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that the door in the neighboring pighouse was open.
He said that in the sweatshirt there was a great churn with blood on his foot.
According to the report, the medical expert confirmed that the 550-kilogram claw had abandoned the farmer.
“My cousin’s feet were blamed and damaged,” said a brother named Wu (according to Guiyang Evening News).
The video from the surveillance camera showed that John went into the market on Thursday at 04:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man did not belong to John or his cousin.
The market manager reported Evening News that the pig was closed to prevent an attack on someone else, while the police were collecting evidence at the scene.
According to the messages, the family of the Yuan and the market administration are leading the negotiations on compensation for his death.
Although pigs attack people, they are rare, but they were before.
Yes, in 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in serious injuries.
Ten years before the pig weighed 650 pounds, she pressed a carte farmer to her tractor and kept it until his wife fired the animal.
After a farmer from the state of Aregon was eaten with his sweats in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a drop.
"They're just playful.
They're delicious and very interrogative... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to give them the proper amount of respect," he said.
The remains of the Rose hurricane bring strong rains to the south-west of the United States.
According to the forecast, the rose hurricane is weaker because it's moving over colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days of Rose, there was a flood in northern Mexico and in the south-west of the United States.
The Roses velocity, hurricane 1 category, was 85 miles per hour in the morning at 5 o'clock on Sunday, and it was recorded in 385 miles south-west of Punta-Euchenia in Mexico.
"Roza," as expected, move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific begins to form a low-pressure area east of the Western coast of the United States. When the Red Sea approaches the South Sea on Monday, it begins to push a deep-strip wave toward the north, to the south-west of the United States.
On Monday, Rose will take some parts of Mexico up to 10 inches of waste.
Then the tropical wet, which interacts with the emerging low pressure area, in the next few days calls for strong lions in the south-west.
Places from 1 to 4 inches of waste cause dangerous sudden floods, rural floods and possible rainfall in the desert.
A deep tropic humidity will lead to the number of accidents in places will reach 2-3 inches an hour, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the north-west, especially most of the Arizona, it's expected from 2 to 4 inches of waste.
Due to the grouped areas of tropical rains, a possible sudden flooding is conditional on rapid deterioration of conditions.
It would be very undesirable to go out into the desert of a foot due to the possibility of the threat of tropical accidents.
A strong rain may lead to the canyons becoming bubbling rivers, and the rain will be accompanied by rainy wind and dust.
The emerging low-pressure area brought strong rain to parts of the coast of southern California.
Possible summer falls more than half a mile can lead to a small stream of garbage and make slippery roads.
It'll be the first drop in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains begin approaching the Arizona at the end of Sunday and at the beginning of Monday before the rain goes everywhere at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
A strong rain will spread in the four corners of the area on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
In October, strong temperatures in the United States can be observed, as the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropicals remain rather warm.
Sometimes it leads to a sharp change in the temperature in the near future.
There's a good example of a sharp drop in temperature in the central part of the United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Amahi, Nebraska, St. Louis, and De-Mynam, Iowa, the temperature difference is almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days the summer heat will try to grow and expand again.
It is expected that in many central and eastern United States countries a warm October with a temperature of 80 degrees – from the South Plains to the North-East.
The temperature in New York can reach 80 degrees per Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a high probability of higher temperatures in the eastern United States until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Cavana’s hearings.
More than 20 million people on six television networks were watching interesting demonstrations of witnesses in the Supreme Court on the matter between Brett Kavan and Christine Blaise Ford, who accused him of sexual violence, which was supposed to have occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political resistance continues, and the publishers interrupted their regular programs for the benefit of the extraordinary news in Friday: the agreement, which was developed by the FBI's Justice Senator Jeff Flyeck: it consisted of conducting a weekly investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate court board that she was 100 percent sure that drunk Cavan grabbed her and tried to get her clothes off for dinner at an older school.
Kawan in his long testimony said that 100% sure it wasn't.
Probably more than 20.4 million people, whose company Nielsen reported on Friday, were looking at it.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available for other networks that showed this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And in Nielsen's company, there's usually a problem with an evaluation of people watching television in the offices.
For comparison: the size of the audience is the same as when playing in the play-off or Oscar prize.
"The Fox News channel, whose experts strongly supported the assignment of Kavana, guided all networks on average with 5.69 million viewers all day," Nielsen said.
ABC took the second place with 3.26 million spectators.
"The CBS had 3.1 million, the NBC had 2.94 million, the MSNBC had 2.89 million, and the CNN had 2.52 million," said Nielsen.
The interest remained high and after listening.
Flake was the main figure of the drama on Friday.
After the office of the moderate republic published a statement that he would vote in support of the Cavan, he was caught by CNN and CBS on Friday morning when the protesters shouted at his address and when he tried to climb the elevator to listen to the court committee.
He stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes when he was licked, and it was broadcast in the straight ephras on the CNN channel.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
‘What do you think he is telling the truth of the country?
They said to him, "You have authority, but many women have delivered her."
Flake said that his office had published the application, and had informed him before the elevator closed that he still had something to say at the hearings in the committee.
All the cable and communication networks for a few hours increased the direct broadcaster, when the Judicial Committee had to vote on the question of the selection of the Kawan candidacy at the Senate's crown.
But Flake said that he would do it, only by realizing that the FBI would consider charges against the candidate next week, which the Democrats call for from a minority.
Flake was partly convinced by a conversation with his friend, a senator-democrat of Chris Kunsam.
After the conversation with Kunsam and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Felix's choice was strong, because it was obvious that in the Republics there would be no votes to confirm the Cave without investigation.
President Trump began investigating charges against the Kavana in the FBI.
Prime Minister of Great Britain May accuses critics of "playing politics" because of a brief
During a Sunday Times interview, Prime Minister Teresa May accused the critics of leaving the European Union, that they are "playing politics" with future Britain, and that they are ruining national interests.
Prime Minister Tereza May came to the Conservative Party conference in British Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In an interview with her in the first field of the newspaper, she was the foreign minister of the Boris Johnson case, who spoke against her so-called "handy" plan on a brief, saying that the suggestion that Britain and the EC have the only tariffs was "very wrong".
The murder of Wade Sims: The police arrested a suspect in the death of the LSU player Dayton Simpsan.
Police arrested a suspect in a death shot at Wade Sims, 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana University.
"The 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and put in prison for a second-degree murder," said Baton-Ruz police chief.
Soldiers showed a video of shooting between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the shooting.
"The police took the oculars from the scene and said they found the Simpsan DNA," said WAFB, a CBS branch.
After Simpson's investigation, the police said that he had confessed to a death shot in Wade.
“The cost of the building is set at $350,000,” Advocate reported.
The next correction of eastern Batan-Russia published on Friday a previous report that says cause of death is a gunshot wound in the head and neck.
The Department of the Louisiana State Police Operational Group, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the South University Police, is asking residents of the area for assistance in research that would support the arrest.
A sports director at Louisiana University, Joe Aleve, thanked the district's law enforcement authority for "old age and seeking justice".
Sims was only 20 years old.
As he grew up, he grew up in Baton-Russia, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana University.
In the middle of the last season, he picked 5.6 points, 2.6 sets for the game.
On Friday morning, a basketball coach at Louisiana University told Will Wade that the team was "depleted" and "shocked" from Wade's death.
"That's what I'm always worried about," Wade said.
The volcano's kicking ass in Mexico City
The ash, which is excavated by the volcano of Papackepetl, reached the southern regions of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for the Warning of Sick Disasters on Saturday suggested that Mexicans stay away from the volcano after it became active and 183 cases of gas and ashes were recorded within 24 hours.
In the center there was a squeak and felt the pushes.
The images in the social media have shown that in the neighborhoods of Mexico, such as Sakimilka, there are thin layers of papalist cover on the automatic windshield.
Geophysics have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 45 miles (72 km) from the south-east of the steel post-magnitude earthquake 7.1 in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don-Goa, has remained active since 1994.
Consistency of the police with the Catalan separatists for the previous year's vote for independence
On Saturday in Barcelona, six people were arrested after the independence supporters met with the police on public order, and thousands of others joined the demonstration for the first anniversary of the polarization vote on the Catalan division.
A group of tradesmen in masks that met the police on public order, left them with eggs and colored them with a purple color, creating dark dust clouds on the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later that same day, the fighting broke out when the police used their dins to keep the demonstrators.
For a few hours, a group of struggles for independence, which were panning "Don't forget, don't give up," met with the present professionals, who shouted, "Live Spain."
According to local press reports, fourteen people have been treated from minor traumas received in protest proceedings.
The tension in the region that seeks independence remains high a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid recognized as illegal, but which was marked by separatists.
The voters mostly took the advantage of independence, although the voter's apple was low, which was largely interpreted by the polling party.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured after the police tried to stop voting in the polls throughout the region as a result of the actions of the angry demonstrators.
Groups that speak for independence spent the night Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the Spanish National Police.
The demonstration continued, but the protests were forced to go another way.
68-year-old Narsis Termes, an electrician who attends a separatist protest along with his wife, said he no longer hopes for a prospect of becoming independent of Catalonia.
"In summer we survived one of the best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy when they could vote, but now we're tired," he said.
In spite of the important but minor victory of the regional elections last November, the Catalan parties that are acting for independence have tried to preserve the momentum this year with many of their most well-known leaders and have found themselves either in voluntary exile, or in exile, waiting for the court to organize the referendum and the next declaration of independence.
42-year-old mechanic Jean-Puch, writing a protest in support of the police on the phone, said that the conflict was related to politicians on both sides.
"Be more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Ariel Junkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in the CIS, announced that he would participate in the elections in the European Parliament next year.
"The choice as a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repressions that we have seen on the part of the Spanish government," he said.
Londoners: The men were arrested after they removed the house on the car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after their car suddenly broke into London's house.
The scientist took place in the Bellinagard-Crecent area on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said there was a damaged gate and a building itself.
Maybe at some point in the car a bullet was released.
The Lioningstan Menga hit wins the Rangers with the number 1:0.
Dolly Mangy's first goal for Louistown's victory
The success of Lionstown has been the result of the Rangers, and this has been designed to cause Steven Gerard to suffer a few losses after him in 18 games on the property of the Ibrox Club Manager.
The Battle of Dolly Mengy was great because Gary Holt got up on one level with the "Hibernian" in the second division.
The Gerard team in this season won't win out in the premier league, and the next week they'll meet with the leaders, the Harts team, who stay at eight points.
So far, Rangers in the League of Europe are taking Rapids on Thursday.
"Livingstan," meanwhile, continued his sinless series in a division of up to six games, and Master Coach Holt still feels right after Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
Lowingstan misses chances because of rough visitors
Holta's command had to be warned long before they were killed, but such a direct call to Rangers caused a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson stopped, but lost his chance to kill himself in the gate, after which Alan Littho could only direct his efforts more widely to meet Craig Halket's strike.
The owners were pleased to allow Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could bother the guest in a few moments.
And that's exactly how the main goal was achieved.
The Rangers were allowed a criminal strike, and the Lioningstan was working on a debate, Declan Gallagher and Robinson gathered to overcome Mango, who had made a passport and killed him from the center of the field.
So far "Randers" has dominated, but it has been found that the defence of the command is unfavourable, and Liam Kelly's locker was practically ineffective.
So it went on in the second half, although Alfred Marelas really saved Kelly.
The sword from Scott Pittman was shot by the Rangers' shield by Alan McGregor, and the Litgos had gone far away from the second set of Lionstown.
The swords were constantly in the gate of "Liveington" and were shot, while two demands of the penalty, after the Halket was called for replacement of Glen Midleton, and the demand for punishment by the hand of the game were denied.
"Penome" from "Livingstan" - analysis
BBC Scotland Journalist Alexander Lamant on the Arene Tony Macaroni
Great productivity and results for Livingstone.
For men they were wonderful, continuing to surpass waiting on this exit path.
Their style of play and composition have practically not changed since they were returned to the upper stage, but it is worth giving the right Holta for how he encouraged the team from the moment of his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was a huge, building well-organized defense, while Manga held Conor Goldsan and Joe Ural all over the field.
Rangers didn't get inspiration.
No matter how good they were at Jared's, they didn't meet those standards.
In the last match they didn't have a sword, only once killing in the gate, which was something like a disturbing call for Rangers, which appeared in the middle of the list.
A mixed attitude toward Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday, 29 September, they were smiling and felt unfounded when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's recent visit to Germany, which is aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They argued about the human rights problem, the freedom of press and Turkey's entry into the EC.
Erdogan headed to Cologne to open a new giant ball.
In this city, the largest number of Turkish populations outside Turkey lives.
The police have been saving themselves for security reasons not to let a crowd of 25,000 people gather in front of the ball, but close to a lot of supporters are gathered to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdaghan, many of whom were Kurds, also expressed their opinion, condemning both the politician Erdaghan and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Protests for and against reflect the differences towards the guest, whose one German Turks reported to the hero, and others judged as an autocrat.
DTZ in Deptford: The user died when he was in a car.
Ravorist died as a result of a car crash in London.
Avarya took place near the crossing of the streets of Bejudom Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, on the south-east of the city, about 10:15 a.m.
The driver stopped, the doctors arrived, but the man died in the place.
Avarya happened a few months after another ravour died as a result of a encounter at Childders Street, about a mile from the site of a Saturday accident.
The static police reported that their employees were working on identifying a person and reporting him to their closest relatives.
Around that place there were roadblocks and bus stops, and a car driver was recommended to avoid this area.
Long-Lartin Tower: Six employees injured during the riots
"Six prison officials have been injured as a result of a severe men's prison strike," the Penitentiary Correction reports.
The riots broke out in Long Larten prison in Austria at around 09:30 a.m. on Sunday and continue until now.
In the fight against disorder involving the eight prisoners in one wing, a special group called "Tarnada" was drawn.
The employees' scene has been treated from minor traumas.
A representative of the Penitentiary Service said: "The specially trained torture personnel was directed to fight those who had committed disorder in Long Larten prison.
Six employees went through treatment after getting trauma.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and we understand that the guilty will be handed over to the police and they can spend more time on shorts."
The Royal Long Larkin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the principal of the prison was undergoing treatment in the hospital after the arrest of the prisoner.
And in October last year, police officers on public order were called to prison to deal with serious riots, during which officers were attacked with water polo balls.
"Roza" threatens the city of Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with strong floods (which can be useful for dry regions)
Tropical hurricanes rarely occur in Arizona, but that's exactly what can happen early next week, because there are traces of the rose hurricane in the south-west part of the desert that poses a risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service was already published on Monday and Tuesday about the sudden floods in the western Arizona and in the south and east Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lakes.
It's expected that on Tuesday, Rose will go straight through Phoenix, approaching the rain on Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that “only ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or a drop of pressure within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the border with the state of Arizona."
The latest model of the National Center of Hurricanees predicts the occurrence of accidents from 2 to 4 inches, with a level that can reach 6 inches in the region of Magallion in Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the number of central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it's probably going to fall from 1 to 2 inches, with this individual value being equal to 4 inches.
For those who are beyond the risk of sudden flooding, the rose hurricane could be long because their region is suffering from drought.
Although the tide is a very serious problem, some of these cases are likely to be useful because in the south-west of the present time droughts are being observed.
According to data from the American Dry Monitoring Agency, almost 40 percent of Arizona's territory survives an extraordinary drought in the second category," reports weather.com.
First of all, the path of the Rose hurricane leads to the peaks of Mexico, at the height of Lower California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the power of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour in 385 miles south of Punta-Euchenia in Mexico, and was moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm is meeting with colder waters in the Pacific Ocean, so it's quiet.
Thus, it is expected that in Mexico, when a tropical storm comes, a river will emerge from the shores of the day or evening on Monday.
Accidents in various parts of Mexico can be strong, which will create a significant risk of flooding.
"There are expected to be a total number of accidents from 3 to 6 inches from Southern California to North-West Sanlar, where possible accidents up to 10 inches," reports weather.com.
Then the rose will move north through Mexico like a tropical storm, before the Arizona border reaches early in the morning, like a tropical pressure drop, which will then continue through the Arizona and the southern part of Utah until the evening of Tuesday.
"The main danger is expected from the Roses or its remains, it's very strong rain in Southern California and in the north-west of Sanora and the South-West desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Centre reported.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening and sudden floods and rural streams and floods in the upper part of the country.
The attack in Midsummer Norton: four attempts to arrest the killers
Three teenage boys and 20-year-old boys were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old body with a lot of terrible wounds in Summerset.
Three teenage boys were found injured in the Terasa Excelsior area in Midsummer Norton about 4 hours on Saturday.
He was delivered to a hospital where he remained in a stable state.
"The 17-year-olds and both the other, the 18-year-olds and the 20-year-olds were arrested at night in Redstock, Avon and Summersett," the police said.
The police turned to anyone who could have any evidence on the mobile phone of what happened to move on in their search.
"The coven is suffering from the reality and the wrath of the Democratic Party," Trump said.
"The vote for Judge Kavano is a vote for the rejection of the unscrupulous and brutal tactics of the Democratic Party," Tramp reported on the rally in Willing, East Virginia.
Trump stated that Cavano was "suffering from the point of view and anger" by the Democratic Party in the process of his election by post.
The Caven gave directions to Congress on Thursday, intensely and emotionally denying the accusations of Christine Blaise Ford about that he had sexually raped her for decades when they were still teenagers.
Ford also gave evidence during the hearings of her accusation.
On Saturday, the President stated that "on this day the Americans saw a bright, qualitative and courageous character" Kawano.
"A voice in support of Judge Kavano is the voice of one of the most excellent experts in the field of law of our time, a lawyer from the excellent history of the State service," he said to the crowd of supporters of West Virginia.
The President abstained from the Kawano election, discussing the importance of the Republicans in the period of interim elections.
"Five weeks remained to one of the most important choices of our time.
I'm not just late, I'm really late," he answered.
"That's why I'm fighting for big candidates everywhere."
The trump disagrees that the Democrats intend to "stand up and prevent".
"It is expected that the first key procedural vote at the Senate level after the Kavanovo election will take place no later than Friday," CNN informed the senior assistant of Parliament's leadership.
Hundreds of people died as a result of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of people suffering increases
"At least 384 people died, many people disappeared as a result of the wave of giant waves on the beaches, when on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi started a huge earthquake and tsunami," the government said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palo on Friday, when the waves were six feet (18 m) high, fighting about the beach in shelters, killing many to death and destroying everything on their way.
After the earthquake of 7.5 magnets, the tsunamis occurred.
"When the threat of tsunamis came up yesterday, people were still on the beach and not running away, and they became victims," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho at a briefing in Jakarta, the president of the Indonesian disaster relief agency.
"The thunders pulled the cars, the beers, the houses, hitting everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the noises passed through the open sea at 800 km/h (up to 497 miles/h) before the impact on the shoreline.
According to his words, some people survived just because they were up on the trees to run away from the tsunamis.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 cents of Palau.
The aerial photos published by the relief agency showed that a lot of buildings and shops were destroyed, the masts turned and collapsed, and the ball was surrounded by water.
The next pushes continued to push the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in the area with a population of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released as a result of a powerful earthquake on Friday is about 200 times higher than the nuclear bomb power dropped on Hirasim in World War II.
According to his data, the city's geography, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, could increase the size of the tsunamis.
The mayor called the "wide" damage and announced that thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and guesthouses were destroyed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found under the wreckage of broken buildings, adding that 540 people were injured, and 29 lost without information.
"The damage and damage can be larger along the coast line 300 km (190 miles) north of Pala, the area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake," Nugroh said.
Dongal's relationship "was completely damaged," Nugroh said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living," says the Red Cross, adding that his colleagues and volunteers were directed to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be a lot worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency widely exposed that they did not report the noises in Paul, but the reporters say that the waves came at a time when a warning was given.
In American photos, published in social media, you can hear a man on the top of the building screaming to people on the street of a coming tsunami.
In a few minutes the water wall fell on the shore, pulling behind the building and the car.
Reuters was not able to verify the authenticity of the extracted material immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a serious power failure, which disrupted communications around Paul, so it was difficult for the authorities to remember saving acts.
According to the authorities, the soldiers began to direct cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated still very much needed food and other items of the first necessity.
The city's airport was opened only to help and will be closed by October.
On Sunday, President Joe Vada planned to visit the evacuation centers in Paul.
As a result of the tsunamis in Indonesia, more than 800 people died.
It's very bad.
"While World Vision employees from Danggala had successfully headed to the city of Pala, where workers were hiding in the brown hideouts set up in their offices' husbands, they had seen desert scenes on their way," said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw a lot of broken houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even if relief groups have taken a dark step after launching disaster relief mechanisms, some have complained that foreign workers who have deep knowledge are preventing them from going to Paul.
According to the Indonesian rule, funding, postings and individuals outside the borders can only begin to occur if the disaster is reported by a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the financial level," said Aulia Arriani, president of the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can open up for international help, but it's not yet.
On the second night in Pala, after the earthquake and tsunamis on Friday, the friends and families of the missing without information hoped that their close miracles would be among those who would leave the unsatisfied Soviet lines of distress.
On Saturday the little boy was kicked out of the sewer.
On Sunday the saviors released a woman who had been under the ruins for two days, and next to her was her baby's body.
Hendon Suddon, a coach of the Indonesian National Paraplanarism team, prepared two of the missing paraplans for Asian games that were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandago, in that number and others who were in the trap at Roa Roa's hotel, were his students.
"I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Hendon told us how a few hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel had spread among the communities, he desperately sent messages to whatsApp participants in Palu who were at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked by one grey chain, not by two blues.
"That means the messages were not delivered," he said.
The thieves stole $26,750 while the banknotes in Newport were reclaimed on the left.
"In the morning of Friday's theft, $26,750 was stolen from Brank's employee, who had established a bank account in Newport, Libya," reports the Newport Police Department.
"The car driver dropped a banker into a fun complex and was willing to deliver more money," wrote Denis McCartti in the release.
While he was busy, another man "run away from the brink's employee" and stole the mech with the money destined for delivery.
According to the report, the witnesses noticed a number of suspects who left the scene, but the police didn't add to the number of incidents.
Anyone who has information about them should contact the Newport police on the phone 859-292-3680.
Kanney West: Reper changes his name to Y ("you").
Reper Kanye West changes his name to Y.
Speaking of a name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: I'm officially known as Kane West.
The West, 41 years old at Y's, used this change as a name for its eighth album that came out in June.
Changes take place before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to run his new Yandhi album.
He's replacing the singer Aryan Grande on the show, which was rejected for "economic reasons," said the show's creator.
Along with the abbreviation of his current professional name, West previously said that this word had religious value for him.
I believe that "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it is "you," West said at the beginning of this year, considering the name of the album with the radio-behavior Big Boy.
So, I'm -- it's you, I'm -- it's us, it's all -- us
It came from Kane, which means "one" to simply "Ye" -- a reflection of our good, our bad, our entire destruction.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
He was one of the most famous rappers who had changed his name.
Sean Combs was obviously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he was inclined to the names Love and Brother Love.
The former employees of Westa, Jay-Ze, also took place without confusion and with the general letters.
AMLO in Mexico promises not to use the army against civilians
The elected President of Mexico Andrés Manuel Lopez Abrador of the fans never use military force against civil society, as the country is about 50 years from the day of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza Lopes Abrador, the followers "never use the troops to praise the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, the soldiers launched a peaceful demonstration on the field, resulting in the death of about 300 people, while the left student movements swept across Latin America.
Lopez Abrador's fans support young Mexicans, issuing monthly grants to those who are learning, thus opening up the most free places at state universities.
"The ill-treatment and lack of educational opportunities attract youth to criminal groups," he said.
The United States has to double its machine intelligence funding
"As China becomes increasingly active in the field of machine intelligence, the United States has to double the amount they spend on research in this area," says an investor and machine specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who worked on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made claims about MI, even if there is no official MI strategy in the U.S.
Meanwhile, last year China presented its plan: by 2030 it will be the first in the field of innovation.
"The implementation of the MI research budget would be a good start, considering that all other countries are leaving the United States, and we are waiting for the next gap in MI," said Lee.
"Funding can double the likelihood that the next major achievement will be achieved in the United States," Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Higher States of Machine Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houton Mifflin Harkurt, the lead executive director of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most famous MlI companies in China, Face +.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie-Melean, he worked on a machine intelligence system that won the U.S. high-ranking Attel player himself, and later he was the head of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese Google Department in China.
Lee recognized the previous official U.S. technology cooperatives, such as the Agency's laboratory cooperatives on a recent research project in the field of defense, and asked if it would be possible to help identify the next monitors.
"The U.S. researchers often have to work a lot to get state grants," Lee said.
"It's not China that picks up academic leaders; it's corporate," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have recently hired the lights from universities to work on MlVs.
Lee said that changing immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen its efforts in the field of machine intelligence (MI).
"I think green cards should be offered automatically by the candidate in the MI branch," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China issued a plan for the development of the next generation of machine intelligence.
"China's National Science Fund provides funding to people in educational institutions, like the National Science Fund and other state organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China below," said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence created a United Nations machine intelligence centre to involve industrial partners and scientific circles, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Machine Intelligence.
And in this month, the Agency's ongoing research project in the field of defence has reported an investment of $2 billion called AI Next.
As far as the National Scientific Organization (NSF) is concerned, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in MI research.
In the meantime, the leadership of the United States, which sought to create a National Security Commission for Machine Intelligence, did not observe the actions for a few months.
Macedonians refer to a reference for changing country names
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia called on the referendum to change their name to "Republic of North Macedonia", allowing for a ten-year conflict with Greece, which blocked applications for participation in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has the rule of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on its territory, and has vowed to join NATO and EC.
In June, both governments concluded a deal with the proposed new name, but nationalist officials claim that these changes undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian population of Macedonia.
The President George Ivan said he wouldn't vote on the referendum, and the Byikot company asked the question of whether or not the voters would meet at least 50 percent of the referendum required.
The question of voting on the referendum suggests: "You are a member of NATO and the EC with the consent of Greece."
The proponents of the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, claim that it is a cost that must be paid for the admission to organs such as EC and NATO Macedonia, one of the countries that has emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to proclaim the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Oliver Georgievski, 79 years old, Skopje.
Although this is not a mandatory legal force, enough Members of Parliament have stated that they will count the results of voting to make it decisive.
Changing the name requires more than two thirds of Parliament.
The National Election Commission stated that no violations had occurred within 1 hour of the day.
However, the apple had a total of 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said 62-year-old elector at Skopje Tanevsky's headquarters.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zauw, his wife Zaritz and his son Duška voted for a referendum in Macedonia, devoted to changing the country's name, which will open the way for her entry into NATO and the European Union, in Strumika, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
Before Parliament was built in Skopje, 54 years ago, Uladimir Kvardark, had taken a small stage and laid chairs in front of the tents, set up by those who would go to the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to be united with our heads raised, not through the service door," Kavadark said.
"We are a poor country, but we have pride.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the European integration."
Prime Minister Zew said that friendship in NATO is taking the necessary investment in Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20 percent.
"I think the overwhelming amount will be "for," because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EC and NATO," said Zayev after the vote.
He said that the result of "yes" would be "the confirmation of our future."
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, it is said that the referendum will take part from 30 to 43 percent of the voters, which is below the mark required.
Another question raised by the Macedonian telephony showed 57 percent of the respondents planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they were saying yes.
For a successful egg referendum there must be 50 percent plus one vote.
Failure in the reference will be the first serious impact on the policy of the past government since its arrival in May of last year.
Look: Sergei Aguara from Manchester City goes to the gate across the entire Bryton defense.
On Saturday, Sergio Aguare and Rahim Sterling solved the issue of British Defense, winning Manchester City with 2:0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
At the 65th minute of Aguare, he made it easy.
Argentinian attackers got a trap in the center of the field.
He raced between three British defenders before hitting the open field.
Then Aguara found herself among the four green shirts.
He went to one defence and waved a few more on the edge of the British field.
Then he pushed the dog on the left flank, finding Sterling.
The English, attacking the first touch in the fine, gave Aguer's sword, which used its right to go around the Briton's shield, Matthew Ryan, to hit the right part of the net.
"Agueira has some problems with her legs," said a journalist in the city of Pep Guardiello.
"We talked about how he played 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he killed a naked man at the same time."
But that's exactly what Sirling gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage of fighting the Prime Minister.
This goal took place in 29 minutes.
Aguera got this ball at the bottom of the British territory.
He sent a beautiful ball through the left flank to Leroy Sun.
Sean made a few adjustments before Sterling was able to reach the far side of the barn.
Attacking the Sky Blues, he directed a ball into the net before he jumped out of the border.

Shercerer wants to play the role of picking points against Rocky
After the Nationals were excluded from the co-operations in the play-off, there was no special reason to sponsor a new start.
But the ever-changing Shercer is hoping to take a blow on Sunday against the Rocky Colorado, but only when there's still going to be a play-off for Rocky, who stay in the leaders after one game with Los Angeles Dodgers in the North West.
The years went by, at least, the same place with the number 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still hope to get their first title in the division.
"Even though we're playing just so, at least we can deal with the situation, knowing that the atmosphere here, in Denver, with the crowd and the other team will be composed so that the game will probably be at the highest level of all I've ever met this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be involved in this?
The Nationals have not yet reported the start on Sunday, but, as it is reported, they are inclined to give the Shercer a sword in such a situation.
The Shercer, who was going to do his 34th start, held a session of the PSC on Thursday and will be on Sunday at regular rest.

Trump is in West Virginia
The President has taken a stand against the situation around his choice of Brett Kavano's Supreme Court, speaking of the importance of the expression of republics in the interim elections.
"All we've done is under threat in November.
Five weeks from one of the main choices in our life.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not late, and I'm really late, so I'm always fighting for big candidates," he said.
And the trumpet went on, "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, see what's going on right now.
And they're determined to regain power, using any means you can see -- authority, measure.
They don't care who they blame, who they have to beat to get control, that's what they want, that's power and control that we're not going to give them."
According to his words, the Democrats intend to "stand up and hinder".
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "bad, bad, vice-versa and false."
He saved himself from the Senate's judicial committee for the prior recognition of the Senator of the Democratic Group of Diana Feynstein, who received a sound assessment from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you allow a document to be imported?
Uh-huh.
No, I don't expect -- it was a very bad nonverbal language -- the worst language I've ever seen."
The work is no longer the main church.
It is impatience to those who express their opinion
If Activists Momentum in my local party voted for me to get hurt, it hardly was a surprise.
After all, I'm the last in a series of Members of Parliament from a Liberian party to whom we're told we're not welcome, all to express our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar response because she strongly opposed antisemitism.
In my case, the censor revealed to me that I did not agree with Jeremy Corbin.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, about the irony of fate, such issues that Jeremy didn't agree with previous leaders.
The news of the meeting, which was held on Friday by the Nottingham Eastern Liberal Party, says that "we want these meetings to be meaningful and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the Liberian party, such a meeting was on Friday.
Unfortunately, today at most the encounter tone isn't like that and the promise of "more good, more soft" politics has long been forgotten, if ever.
It becomes increasingly evident that in the Liberian party different views are not allowed, and every opinion is appreciated from that side of view, it is primary to party leadership or not.
It began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as colleagues, with whom I had previously thought that I shared the same political views, began to expect me to take a step back, and took positions with which I would never agree on matters of national security or on the EU's single market.
Every time I speak in public -- and it doesn't matter what I say -- there's a lot going on in social networks that call for the rejection of the elections, condemning the policy of the centre, saying that I'm no longer in the Liberian Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I was more fortunate than any of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me as a rule are political.
I am delighted by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who are facing the current of sexual or racist consequences, but they never get away with.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this policy era is the normalization of the level of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said the Liberals should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're no longer an organization that has different views, and with every movement of "insecurity" or change of party selection rules, it's getting worse.
For the past two years I have been given a lot of advice, which called me not to fall in spirit, not to be so loud, and then everything will be fine with me.
But that's not what I went into politics for.
Since I joined the Liberian 32 years ago as a school student responsible for the neglect of the Tatcher government, because of which my teacher in the school system has been trained, I have tried to resist the best public services for those who have more than I need - whether it's a local resident or a government minister.
I never hid my political views, in that figure in the past.
No one in East Notingham could ever get involved in my political positions and areas of conflict with the current leadership.
For those who have fought for this movement on Friday, I would like to say that, when the country is headed towards Brexit, which is causing damage to the homeowner, to the entrepreneurship and to our state service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and the strength of my loyalty to the leader of the Liberian party.
But in fact the only message that I have is not Nottingham Momentum, it's my electors, or it's the members of the liberator, or it's not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of rejection will be and the political ambition will not prevent me from acting in the interests of all of you.

Air-Melrovs 38 - 17: Invincible Air at the top
The two late attempts, perhaps, had some final results, but, no doubt, Air deserved a triumph in this curiously interesting game of the tenent's primer league.
Now they're marking the tournament table, one side of ten.
After all, it was their highest defense, just as their best chances of making their masters, coach Peter Murcy Mercy had the full right to be satisfied.
"We have still tried our games so far, and we are still invincible, so I must be happy," he said.
The servant of Christy of Melrose said: Give the proper Air, he dared more than we do.
The 14-minute trial of Grant Anderson, converted by Fraser Klim, put Ira in the foreground, but the yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, obtained for the Warriors' game, allowed Melrovus to swallow the numbers, and Jason Baggot caught up with an unrealized attempt.
Klimov extended the leadership of Eira with the help of the pen, before, immediately at the stop, he killed, and then strengthened the salt test, making 17-5 Eira at the stop.
But Melrows well began the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, transformed by Bogota, shortened the distance to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious trauma of the Road Nott, which was extended, and after the re-starting of Air moved further through the attempt of Staffard McDonald, realized by the Climates.
Air, carrying out Captain Blair McFerson's duties, got a yellow card, and once again Melrows forced another man to pay with the help of an unrealised attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the February pressure.
However the gentlemen returned, and when Stroan Hatchson got a yellow card for what he had picked Klimov without a sword from a criminal line, McFerson landed behind Eiro.
The climate had realized its attempt, which it had made again almost after the re-start, after Kyle Row had hit David Armstrong in the fine and sent flanger Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the masters of the field.
A Still Game star, like ready to go to a new career in a restaurant business
However, the star of Ford Kieran's game is going to enter the hotel business industry after it turned out that it was appointed by the director of the licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor is playing Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show he's writing, and he's filming with his former comic partner, Greg Hemfil.
Duet announced that the next nine series will be the last in the show series, and it seems Kernan plans to act after Craigang.
According to the official records, he is the director of Avolingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the source of the Scottish Sun found that Kernan was hoping to participate in the "flowering trade in the Glass".
"Our sea": Bolivia, which has no way out to the sea, hopes that the court will once again open the way to the Pacific Ocean
The Maracai patrol a military-marca headquarters in La Pase.
Civil buildings under the blue flag.
In military-martial bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the word "the sea is ours on the right" is painted.
It's our duty to recover.
In all of Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, the memory of the shoreline lost by Chile in a bloody conflict due to the resources of the 19th century, still alive, as well as the effort to sail on the Pacific again.
These hopes may have reached maximum peaks in the last decade, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of discussion.
"Balivian has a impulse, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course it is waiting for a positive result," said the Balivian diplomat Robert Calsadilla.
Many Bolivians will watch the decision of the MS on large screens all over the country, hoping that the tribunal in Gaza will, after decades of intense talks, support Bolivia's statement that Chile is obliged to lead talks about providing Bolivia with a sovereign exit to the sea.
Eva Marales is the charismatic president of Bolivia who faces a rival struggle for re-election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of October.
But some analysts think that the court will hardly take a decision for the benefit of Bolivia, and it's a little bit of a change, even if it does.
The AAN organization, based in the Netherlands, has no right to take decisions on Chile's territory and has stated that it will not determine the source of possible talks.
What the International Court of Justice's ruling is only six months after the final arguments were considered, to prove that the case was "not complicated," said the Chilean expert in Paz Zarate International Law.
And far away from pursuing Bolivia's affairs, the past four years may have left her back.
"The issue of access to the sea was manipulated by the current Bolivian administration," Sarat said.
According to her words, the battler Maralez lost the rest of Chile's well-being.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but then the discussion will be very difficult.
Since 1962, two countries have not exchanged letters.
The former president, Edward Radrigez Welle, the representative of Bolivia in Gaza, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia took the "excellent opportunity to open up a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "the end of 139 years of mutual disunity," he said.
Kalsadilla also denied that Marales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used the marine problem as a political resistance.
"Bluffs never refuse their right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The stop is the opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea claims that nuclear disarmament will not happen until they can trust the United States
Minister of Foreign Affairs North Korea Rhy Young Ho says his country will never cease to use its nuclear weapon until he can trust Washington.
Riya spoke on Saturday at the AAN General Assembly.
He called upon the United States to fulfil the promises made during the summit in Singapore among the leaders.
His comments come from the United States.
Riya says it's a "insurmountable dream" to continue sanctions and challenge the U.S. declaration against the end of the war in Korea ever put the North on the knees.
Washington is afraid to agree with the declaration if Phejiang does not first start a significant process of resolution.
And Kim, and US President Donald Trump require a second summit.
But there's great skepticism on the part of the Pyrenees that seriously opposes the arsenal, which the country probably considers as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompey plans to visit Phanyan in the next month to prepare for the second Kim-Tramp summit.
On Parisian fashion shows we saw the newest line in massive head dresses on the way to the store in your city
If you want to increase your hat collection or close the sun completely, you can no longer search.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the floor a number of unusually high-end suits for their SS19 collection, which exceeded the expectations of Paris Fashion Week.
In this summer, Instagram attracted the popularity of non-practice hats, the designers who sent their faces to the floor.
Valentine's famous rice was a delicious coastal hat, decorated with wide fields, similar to the feathers that filled the heads of the models.
Other accessories of an unusually large size included collected gemstones, magic hats and even pineapples, but they were not meant to keep their head warm.
Tom Brown also showed a set of wise masks--just before Halloween.
Many of the different color masks were with dry lips and more reminded of the Ganybal Lekter than the high fashion.
One of them recalled a sink for underwater swimming with tube and hideous glasses, and the other was like a frozen cone.
And if you continue to follow the vast attributes of fashion, you're lucky.
Those who look at the style predict that huge hats can break into our all-round life.
The hats of a huge size go five to La Bomba, a salami hat with two-foot strips of width that can be seen in all, from Ryan to Emily Ratakowski.
The cult label on a very uncomfortable hat, which was released in social networks, has promoted another big face on the floor -- a salami beach bag, almost as big as a model with this bag, dressed in a buyer.
The dark orange bag with the reef, decorated with the reef counter and covered with a white leather handle, became an excellent part of the collection of Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 on Week Fashion in Paris.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage said FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer, as the designer had a great impact, and it would be difficult to ignore attempts by non-profit accessories."
John Edward: Language practice is a necessary skill for all citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland retain academic success, which has continued since 2018 with yet another excellent result of exams that are supported by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community beginnings.
More than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, schools represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to ensure a better level of work for their students and parents.
Independent schools try to prepare their students for further higher education, chosen by their careers and their places as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable objects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you talk to a man in a language he understands, it stays in his head.
If you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart."
It's a bright reminder of what we can't expect only in English if I want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
From the results of the last exams this year, we see that languages take the first place in league tables with the highest scores in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a higher score of A.
The data collected in 74 SCIS participating schools showed that 72 percent of students reached higher grades A in Chinese, while 72 percent were students of German, 69 percent were French, and 63 percent were Spanish, and they also reached Level A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages such as vital skills that are undoubtedly needed by children and young people in the future.
Now languages as objects are selected as STEM objects (studies, technology, engineering and mathematics) in educational programs of independent schools and elsewhere.
The question raised by the Committee on Employment and Training in Britain in 2014 showed that 17 percent of the reasons that employers brought about difficulties in filling vacancies were associated with a lack of language skills.
So more and more language skills become necessary to prepare young people for future careers.
In view of the more promising workplaces that require language knowledge, these skills become necessary in a globalized world.
No matter what profession you choose, if you learn another language, in the future it will be a real advantage if you have such skills for your whole life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in the first place among competitors.
According to the YouTube question, in which more than 4,000 adult Britons participated in 2013, 75 percent failed to speak well in a foreign language, and French was the only language in which a two-digit 15 percent spoke.
That's why investment in learning languages is now important for modern children.
The availability of several languages, especially in developing countries, will give children more opportunities to find a good job.
In Scotland, every school will be distinguished by the languages taught in it.
A range of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will be teaching languages that are most important to Great Britain in view of the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interest, independent schools will always choose from a few languages with a teacher's composition, which is a specialist in this field.
Scotland's independent schools are trying to ensure an environment of education that will correct children and equip them with the skills needed to achieve success, regardless of what will be in the future.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the global business environment languages still have a vital value for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages must be viewed as “the skills of international relations”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and advantage for the youth of Scotland.
This must be done
John Edward, Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
Lebron debuts Sunday in San Diego
The start of waiting for the fans who want to see Lebron James make his first start at Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers Coach Luke Walton reported that James was playing at the pre-season opening Sunday against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
But for as many minutes as he plays, it's still necessary to determine.
"It's going to be more than one and less 48," Walton said on the Lakers official website.
Lieutenant Mike Trudelle wrote that James would probably play in limited minutes.
In line with the practice that took place this week, James was asked about his plans for the six pre-season graphics.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
The time to launch the Trumpet in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight, in Willing, West Virginia, President Donald Trump begins most of the company's activities.
It's the first of the five planned talks of Trump next week, including stops in friendly places, Tennessee and Mississippi.
When confirming the vote on the election to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump seeks to strengthen the support of the interim elections, since the Republic risks losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
When the trump's speech starts tonight in West Virginia and how to look at it on the Internet?
The tramp performance in Willing, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 o'clock in the evening. ET tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see the Thramp in the West Verheugen on the Internet below in the direct ephere on YouTube.
Trump, more than anything, this week will consider hearings on the candidacy of the Bret Kavana Supreme Court, which has problems with the opportunity of charges in sexual claims with the expected confirmation of the Senate vote during the week during the FBI investigation.
But the main purpose of these speeches is to give assistance to the Republicans who are facing the election in November.
Thus, President Trump's campaign announced that these five speeches were directed next week to "activize the activities of volunteers and supporters, as the Republics are trying to defend and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
"Congratulation control is so important for his agenda that the president goes to the maximum possible number of states, as we enter the tense pre-election season," said the Reuters Agency of the Trump Company.
The Wesbanco Arena in Willing, which is planned for today's event, can attract fans from Agao and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pitburg media," reported The West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month, when Trump visited West Virginia, the state in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate in the Senate from the West Virgin Patrick Morris, who is the leader in the questions.
"It's not a very good sign for Morris, that the president should come to try to give him a kick in the questions," said Simon Hedar, a pilot from the University of West Virginia, reports Reuters.
Ryder 2018: U.S. command is being sent to fight to keep hope of life on Sunday
After three one-way sessions on Saturday's four days, perhaps they were just what it took for this Cube Reader.
The owner of the impulse, which seems to be a completely invented sports concept in which players sincerely believe, and nothing more than cooperatives.
So where would they say the impulse now?
"They had the advantage of six points, and now four, so I think we're going through it with a little impulse," said Jordan Spetz, spying on the day.
Europe's advantage, of course, is four points forward, and there are twelve more.
Americans, as Spith says, feel that they have taken the wind easily, and they have what they expect, not least because of the shape of Spyta and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day long, and each can boast three points of four.
Spate was mortal from football to green and is an example.
These yawning cries of celebration were getting louder than the length of any round, and he suffered a decisive blow to play in the match on four fields when they and Thomas had fallen two by two.
His impact, which allowed them to win the 15th, was met with a similar scream, like that which tells you that he thinks the American team is not off.
"You just have to get deeper and worry about your own match," said Spici.
Each of these players has already gone.
18 holes to make a score.
In the last two days, the only players who have acquired more points than Spyt and Thomas are the French Malinarians and Tommy Fletwood, the unmistakable story of Cuba Ryder.
Strange but magical couples in Europe four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Mallowwood" was the only couple who made no gods on Saturday, on the second half of the day, but they also escaped the gods on Saturday morning, on Friday and on the second half of the Friday.
It happens, and like their energy, like, flowing to this stormy crowd and from it, and it confirms that they are the players that win Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to close a potential victory in Europe when the sun rises on Le Golf National, than the Fletwood or the Malinarians.
You want both at the same time on different holes.
The talk about European glory remains temporary.
Bobb Watson and Web Simpson did a short work on Serge Garcia, a hero of the early furthest when he was in a couple with Alex Norren.
The Gods and two twins on the previous nine drew the Spaniard and swirl it with which they could not get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will be able to help you with your hole.
After the match of four swords and fours, it's so interesting to observe carefully because of the interaction between the couple's composition, the advice they give, the advice they don't perform, and how the strategy can be changed in one moment.
Europe has thus far become a better team and has played a major role in the last day, but at this fourth session it is also shown that the US team is seeking to fight, in which some people have doubted, especially in the United States.
Europe is going to the Rider Cube final, number 10-6.
Europe will have a good advantage in the last day of Kubka Ryder after it comes out of the four-ball Saturdays and four-balls with 10-6 over the United States.
Tommy Fletwood's inspired duet and French millinarians have marked a fight against two victories over Tiger Woods to bring the results to Le Golf National at four points.
The European side of Thomas B'erna, trying to save the trophies that they lost in Hazeltin two years ago, ran into an American agency of unsatisfaction in the morning, getting a 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more resistance to the four swords, winning two swords, but they could not do more.
To save the trophies, Jim Furick's side needs eight points from the 12 single matches on Sunday.
Flethwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row, and he and Malinary, who got the name Molliwood after the sensational exits, is only the second couple, who won four points for their first four matches in the history of the Cube Ryder.
Breaking Woods and Patrick Reed into four matches, they've been wonderfully fastened to win the down Woods and the American choicest Bryson Decomb 5 and 4.
Woods, who was driving himself through two matches on Saturday, showed a random flash, but now he lost 19 out of 29 times in the match four swords and fours and seven pairs.
Justin Rose, resting on the x matches of four swords, went back to partner Henry Stanson in the match of four swords to defeat 2 & 1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coepky--takes one and the other place in the world.
Europe had not had its way, although it was pleasant, fresh day to the south from the west of Paris.
On Saturday, the three-time top winner Jordan Spate and Justin Thomas set up a checkpoint for Americans in two points.
They won 2 and 1 over John Ram and Ian Puller from Spain in the match of four swords and returned later to win Puller and Rory McCillroy 4 and 3 in four, losing two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Kubka Rider team returned with a deficit of four points, which goes alone, although the owners of Furyka should only paint to save the trophies.
But after the next two days, which were the best, Sunday's contract looks like they're getting it all.
North Korea says "no way" will not be disbanded in one way or another without trust
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated that on Saturday the United Nations continues sanctions that strengthen the lack of confidence in the United States, and under such conditions the country cannot refuse nuclear weapons in a unilateral order.
R. Yun Ho stated to the annual General Assembly of the World Body that in the past year North Korea had adopted "significant measures of good will", such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, demounting nuclear testing zones and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"At once we don't see the right answer from the United States," he said.
"Without trust to the United States, there will be no certainty in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way in the first place in a unilateral order to disarm ourselves."
Despite the fact that Ri republished the usual North Korean complaints against Washington to the "step-by" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea was rewarded because it took steps, his application proved significant in that he did not reject the unilateral declaration of denuclearization made by Phanjam in the past.
Ri escaped a joint application by Kim Chen In and Donald Tramp in the first story of the United States president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim offered to work on the road to the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while the Tromp promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea is officially trying to end the war in Korea from 1950 to 53 years, but the United States has said that Pyrenees must first refuse nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed the call to abolish severe international sanctions in relation to North Korea.
"The United States of America first insists on "denuclearization" and increasing pressure levels with sanctions to achieve its goal in a forced way, and even speaking against "the end of the war," says Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can put us on the knees, is the invincible dream of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the duration of sanctions deepens our mistrust."
Ri didn't mention plans at the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the United States Chief of Staff noted earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korea leader Mun Jayin in the last five months and added, "If the question of denuclearization were South Korea, and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Caribbean would not become such a dump."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was markedly different from last year when he spoke to the AAS, the General Assembly stated that the goal of the United States contingent with the help of the North Korean missile was inevitable after "Mr. President of Evil" Trump called Kim a missile suicide.
This year in AAN Trump, who in the past year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, Kim praised for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said that there would still be much to do, and sanctions must remain in force until the North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump reported that he had no time frame for it, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia are opposed to the AAN. The Security Council has stated that Phanyan should be rewarded for the measures taken.
However, Secretary of the United States Mike Pompey told the AAN Security Council on Thursday that "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must be active and must continue until we are sure of complete, final and confirmed dinuclearization."
The Security Council strengthened its sanctions against North Korea in 2006, attempting to stop financing the nuclear and ballistic missile programmes of Peñan.
Pompey met with Ri in the Security Council's colours. The General Assembly then announced that the next month he would visit Phanyan again to prepare for the next summit.
Pompey visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July he left Phanyan, stating that the progress made with North Korea over the course of a few hours' speech ended with the statement of the visa that he presented the demands of "like the gangsters."
At the meeting with Munich this month, North Korea has managed to eliminate the missile installation and the nuclear complex when the United States takes appropriate measures.
Trump said that Kim's "appropriate measures", which he expects, is a guarantee of security and an incentive to normalize relations with Washington, which Trump promised in Singapore.
Harvard students are taking a good rest course.
The new Harvard University course this year should teach students more to sleep, and my goal is to compete with culture to learn from coffee in my hand.
The scientist came to the conclusion that students in one of the best universities in the world often don't know how to care properly for themselves and their health.
Charles Chaser, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist in hospital and hospital, developed a course that he thought was the first in his country in the United States.
The inspired speech about the influx of sleep on learning began a course.
At the end of the lecture, one girl came to me and said, "Why did they just tell me this right now, at the last class?"
"She said that nobody and never talked to her about the importance of sleep – it surprised me," he said The Telegraph.
For the first time in this year, the course taught by the student explains why good sleep habits promote academic and sports achievement and also improve overall mood.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and director of health care at the university, said that the university decided to take the course after finding out that students were often sleep free for a week.
An hour-long course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a room on the Internet where students click on a cup of coffee, aprons and books that tell about the effects of caffeine and light and how a lack of sleep affects sports indicators, and also the importance of the habit before sleep.
At an alarming stage, participants tell us how a multi-year sleep free can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
The compass map, with interactive images, calls on participants to think about their everyday life.
"We know that it will not suddenly change the behavior of students.
But we believe that they need to know it as well as everyone knows about the consequences of smoking for health," said Professor Chesler.
According to his words, the culture of the evening is still there, adding that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students will lead to more and more problems in getting out of sleep.
"The assured adequate sleep of good quality must be the "secret weapon" of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety," he said, "even to avoid the lower weight, as the freeing of the sleep makes the brain constantly hungry."
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler develop a course.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to train everyone on the campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all Asians to complete a similar education program before entering the university.
Professor Chesler recommended that students set up an hour to know when to go to sleep and when to wake up, aware of the harmful effects of the "blow light" coming from the screens of the monitors and light-emitting lights that can change the contemporary mode, leading to the problem of sleep.
"Livingstan" 1:0 "Randers." Menga kills Jarard's goal.
Rangers suffered another time when Dolly Mangy's goal convinced that Steven Jarard won't get a 1 0 at the Lioningstan Stadium.
Ibrax wants to record his first victory on the way to a 4-1 trial in February in St. John's, but the command of Gary Holton is already taking over as a 18-game manager to leave eight points on his side, leaving the leaders of the first-generation Ladbrokes Hearts.
Manga hit seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers team, inspired by the naked, didn't look like they were suffering at once.
At the same time as Rangers drop to sixth place, Lioningstan got to third place, and behind them are the Hibernates with a ball difference.
For Rangers there may be additional problems after how forward Colum Spence should be treated from the trauma of the head after as in his case the subject was thrown out of the Tribune.
Gerard made eight changes to the players, so that Ira did not play in the seminal of Kubca Betfred.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Levi under 11 rooms, which allowed to pick up a point from Hearts last week, and was in awe of how well they had walked every step of their opponents.
"Randers" was more mastered by the ball, but Livingstone did more attempt to kill the ball.
They had to be killed in two minutes, when the first Mangy directed the ball through Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's gates, and then the half-breeder used this chance.
The successful punishment of Jacobs Keegan's stroke delayed Craig Halket's surprise, but his partner in defense of Alan Litho's was able to put a strong blow behind him.
Rangers took control, but in the last loss of the game, they were more hoping to kill than they were showing a good game.
Alfred Morelas certainly had to be punished for a quarter of an hour before the end when he and Stephen Loveless met in the field, but Judge Stephen Thompson did not take the complaint from Colombia.
The Rangers managed to hit the gate only in the first half of the game, but there were Ibrax Liam Kelly's brats who almost gave up Lasan Kulibali's goal and the effective father of this Aquire.
Although killing the first goal at the 34th minute of Livi, it may have been against the next active game, but no one denies that they have to demonstrate by noticing a good game.
The Rangers couldn't break Jacob's neck again.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher gave a passport to Scott Robinson, who blocked Mango to get the chance to kill in the gate.
Gerard replaced Kulibali's stop at Kent's paradise, and it showed an effective impact when he attacked Merelas, but the impressive Kelly ran away and locked up the impact.
But "Livingstan" continued to please visitors, playing that game, which they just liked, and the Lithuanians and the Halket continued to share the ball after a long struggle.
The side of Holt could only prevail for the last few minutes, but McGregor was playing well to resist Jacobs before how the Litgow had gone to a spare bed.
The replacement of Rangers Glenn Midland took place in a row after the penalty when he met Jacob, but Tomsan managed to get away.
German: Geiger's inventor.
A page from our Almanac Sunday morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and PADLICI... the day of future physicist Iagan Wilhelm "Hans" Gaeger, born in Germany.
Gaeger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which resulted in the appearance of a device known as Gaeger's numerator.
Gaeger's numerator became a part of science and appeared in pop culture, as in the 1950 movie "Called the Karanand", where they seemed to have been the smallst scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: Who is he on earth?
Rogers: "It's the Geiger counter that's used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put the earpieces on, you really have the ability to hear the sounds of atoms that are radioactive in the minerals."
Evans: "Tell me, is this really disturbing right now?"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before 63 years of birth.
But the inventions that bear his name continue to be used.
A new advanced vaccine can help the immune system to see cancer cells.
The new antiviral vaccine can help the immune system see bad cells and destroy them.
The vaccine, however, teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, which will be part of the treatment.
The method predicts getting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the lab.
Then the cells can "see" the cells that are distributed in many cancer cells, and then reintroduction the other cells.
The test vaccine demonstrates the success of patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who was introduced to a vaccine that helps the immune system recognize cancer cells found that the cancer of the ovaries disappears for 18 months.
The method includes getting immune cells in the patient, changing them in the lab, so they can "see" HER2 proteins, common to many cancer cells, and then being introduced again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesia, Maryland, said that our results show that there is a very promising vaccine.
"HER2 stimulates the growth of a number of species of antibodies that compete with the cancer of small bees, eggs, light and thick cats," said Professor Berazofski.
It's a similar approach to finding immune cells in patients and learning them to reach cancer cells well worked when treating the cancer.
The West dog started a discussion in support of the Trump, bearing the title of the IAEA, after it appeared in the SNL.
That didn't look good.
In a study on Saturday evening, Kane West was disrespected after an address where he praised the United States. President Donald Trump said he would fight for the second term in 2020.
After performing the evening of his third song entitled "The City of Privy," when he was in the chapter "Make America a Big Again", he spoke against the Democrats and confirmed his support for Trump.
"How many times do I talk to the whites, and they say, 'How can you support the Trump, he's a racist?'
"Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have long left America," he said.
The SNL started a show with Matt Diamond's main role, where the Hollywood star was filming Brett Cavano's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee when it came to dealing with the sexual violence of Christine Blaise Ford.
Despite the fact that the speech was not broadcast, the words of West Papali were framed and were loaded in social media by Chris Rock.
She didn't understand if she tried to get rid of the West.
Besides, West complained to the audience that he had a hard time behind the scenes.
They thanked me for the bullets.
They said, “Do not come out with this cup.
They thanked me.
"And then they say I'm in the middle of nowhere," he said, as the Washington Examiner reports.
The West continued: "Do you want to see the big spot?" "Saying that he" will put on my Sperman's hat, which meant he can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go ahead?
Try to love.
Because of his statements, at least two times they took the hearing off, and the SNS representatives were confused with Veraita's message.
West was taken as a replacement of the singer of Aryan Grande, whose had been a boy, rapper McMiller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many of the songs I Love It, dressed in Perrier's water bottle.
West received support from the manager of the TPUSA Conservative Party, Kendes Turner, who wrote on the Twitter: "One of the bravest spirits Thank you for your support."
But by leading the show-off Karen Hunter wrote that the West was just who he was, and it was always wonderful.
"But I have decided not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothing, or by supporting his "arts," which I consider to be captivating and distorting the ideology that harms my spouse.
He's free.
So did we," she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, saying that he now "is officially called Kane West."
He was not the first artist to change his name, and went after Grandpa, also known as Puff Grandpa.
His colleague's rapper Snoop Dogg was called the beauty of Snoop Lion and, of course, the legend of music, which changed his name to a symbol, and then he and the artist earlier known as prince.
Trying to kill Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a felony in a restaurant in the eastern part of Belfast on the second man fell on Friday.
The scientist happened in Balihakamore, as the police report.
It's expected that the defendant will appear on Monday at Belfast's court.
The charges will be considered by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harrington's Blue Throne caught up with the idealized brutality.
Keith Harrington is known for his dazzling sword and role John Snow in the series "The White Houses" of the Middle Ages of HBO
But the 31-year-old actor got a stereotype of a hero sword, which means that young boys often feel harder to respect.
Speaking in the Culture of Sunday Times, Keith said he thought "something happened" and asked how to solve the problem of idealized brutality in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently got married to his neighbor on the Roosevel thrones, Rose Leslie, who was also 31 years old, admitted that she felt the power of the opportunity to solve this problem.
"Do I personally feel strong guys when we were wrong with courage?" he said.
"Why do we teach men when they grow up, from a point of view that we see now?"
Kitt believes that television must be responsible for the emergence of brutality because of very male characters.
He continued: "What lies at the beginning and why is it taught?
Why teach on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they must be so sure to be a real person?
I think it's really one of the biggest issues in our time -- how do we change it?
Because it's obvious what's happening to young people.
In an interview he also admitted that the next summer the series will end, and he will leave the field of battle the series and won't do any doxels or bikes to the Free Thrones.
From November Kitt will be reborn by the True Western Sam Shapard, who is a historical director with his brother, who is a slave.
The actor recently told me that he considered meeting with Rose's wife the best opportunity to end the "Tron game".
"I met my wife in this show, so I got my future family, and my life here," he said.
The rose was played by Ygritte, the character in which the hero Keith John Snow was in love with this fantastic series, which was staged by Amy.
The couple promised in June 2018 at Leslie's headquarters in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS increased by 14%.
According to data from health professionals, more than 820,000 people were infected in the country.
Only around 40,000 new cases were registered in the second quarter of 2018.
The overwhelming majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, as it was in the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection spreads in some areas of China as a result of blood transfusions.
"The number of people infected with HIV infection through blood transfusions has declined almost to zero," said the Chinese authorities at a conference in the Union.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China grows by 100,000 each year.
The transmission of HIV infection through sex is an acute problem for the Chinese LGBT-supply.
Homosexualism was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination in relation to LGBT people is still eating.
Because of the conservative value in the country, about 70-90% of men who engage in sex with men eventually marry women.
Many diseases are spread out of insufficient knowledge and sexual contraception.
Since 2003, the Government of China has made universal access to HIV medicines in efforts to address this global problem.
Maxine Waters rejects the fate of the victims, the danger and the theory of conspiracy by her colleagues in Parliament
The U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters dropped the charge on Saturday that her associate posted personal information about the three U.S. senators on Wikipedia pages.
The democrat of Los Angeles claimed that the claims are for participants of the highest wing and their websites.
"A lie, a lie, and a lot of disgusting lies," says Waters on Twitter.
The published information, as reported, includes home addresses and phone numbers in the United States.
The information posted by an unknown person on the Capital Hill during the hearings of the Senate's commission on charges of sexual harassment against a member of the Bret Cavana Vocational Court was published on the Internet on Thursday.
The escape took place some time after the three senators questioned Kavana.
"Conservative sites, such as Gateway Puntit and RedState, report that the IP address of the source was linked to the Waters office and provided information to the Waters team," Hill reports.
"This unwarranted claim is completely false and absolutely false," Waters continued.
"A member of my team, whose data, personal information and security were compromised by these austerity and false accusations, at any rate did not respond to the leak of this information.
This unwarranted assertion is completely false and absolutely false."
Waters' application quickly called for a criticism on the Internet, including the number of the former press-sacrat of the White House of Arry Flasher.
"It's a rejection of anger," Flesher wrote.
It's to prove that she doesn't have the courage to be a member of Congress.
If anyone accuses them of not doing, they should not be caught.
They don't have to lead themselves brutally.
They must not question the motives of their accusation.
They must be calm and kind.
Flasher compared Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Cavano when they were accused of being too angry during the hearings on Thursday.
Amar Navara, a candidate from the Republican Party, who talks and participates in temporary elections, also appeared on Twitter.
"It's a resonance if it turns out to be true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters stated that her office had warned the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about these false statements.
"We guarantee that the guilty will be found," she continued, "and they bear the legal responsibility for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to any of my team's employees."
Review Johnny English Strikes Again strikes Rowen Atkinsan's invented spy.
Now it's a tradition to look for the meaning of BREXITU in any new film with a British cover, and this cover seems to be in a comedy and ex-French, Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and lasted in 2011 called Johnny English Counselor.
Can the satire express itself well in terms of the apparent folly we look when we talk about the new export opportunities?
In any case, the second time he appeared in print, the incompetent Johnny English got the opportunity to laugh at things--his name was louder than any comical images he made for non-English viewers in cinematography.
Of course, he's a secret agent who, despite his sensuous claim to glamour, got a little like Clouseau with Mr. Bin's rice and a little so-called boy who brought a single note to the Hor Fire at the ceremony of opening the Olympics in London in 2012.
At first his character was based on the vandals and international mysteries of Atkinsan, who used to play in the forgotten Barclaycard, leaving chaos on his way.
Here are a few pleasant moments that were not before.
I loved Johnny English, who was approaching the helicopter, dressed in the middle of the afternoon, and the paws of the rotor a little beat off his helmet.
The Do Atkinsan for the theatrical comedy is demonstrated, but the humour feels weak, and so it's amazing when serious movies, such as Agent 007: Mission Unimplemented, are definitely offering comedy as the main part.
The humour feels as if it were not only for adults, but also for children, and even the foolish accidents of Johnny English isn't as inventive as the silent Atkinsan movies in the person of Bin.
Many years of current thinking are serious problems in Great Britain.
Cyber hacker penetrated the super-secret community of British spies in Great Britain, opening up the names of all British agents in the area, to disappoint the state agent, which is unfortunately the small role of Kevin Eldan.
This is the last point for Prime Minister, which is a proud and mixed act that is already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible with this Quasi-Terezai-May, but there is nothing in the script.
Her research consultants report that, since every real spy will be discovered, she will have to activate one of those already retired.
And that means that for Johnny English itself, it's getting complicated: now he works as a sixth teacher in a number of chess institutions and teaches how to be an unperceptive operator: some good examples here, because English offers the Academy of Spinach Music.
The English returned to Whitehall for an extraordinary briefing and joined his former friend Bo, who is playing Ben Miller again.
Now because my marriage is tied to the commandant of the underwater boat, whose role Vicky Pepperdin had done a little empty.
Thus Batman and Robin get awfully wrong things in the secret agency of the Queen, where they work again, meeting the beautiful woman Volga Kurileen.
Meanwhile, the prime minister receives a dangerous command from a charismatic technical billionaire, who says he can solve the problems with the hackers of the Great Britain: with the capricious Jason Walt, who plays Jake Lacey.
The English and the Bow are starting their equinox from the immediate things: masked under the officer, burned the French restaurants; created a riot, fought with the smugglers on the edge of the luxurious Volta yacht; England is doing a clean anarchy, because he is trying to use the guarinture of virtual reality to meet the interior of Walt's house.
All the moments taken for the last event, but equally pleasant and noisy, which have quite a lot of children on TV.
Pretty good stuff.
And how with other movies about Johnny English I couldn't think: can't the British movie industry give Rowan Atkinson the role that really demonstrates his talent?
The Liberian Party rejects that a plan is being developed to pay the British for a four-day work week with a payout of five days.
Jeremy Corbin's work party must consider a radical plan when the British only work four days a week, but pay them for five.
It is reported that the party wants corporate managers to hand over the results of the work done as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence, giving them an extra day off.
It was clear that the employees would be enjoying the three-day fronts, but they'd still be getting the same salary.
The source indicates that the idea corresponds to the party's economic program and plans to direct the country to support the workers.
The train crew approved the four-week transition as a good way to use the change in the economy.
The oldest source in the Liberian party told The Sunday Times: "The planned review of actions will be announced by the end of the year.
It's not going to happen right now, but the four-week work week is an idea that matches the view of the party and the general industrial strategy of regulating the economy for the benefit of workers.
The Liberian Party is not the first to approve such an idea, the Green Party promises to carry out a four-week work week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the efforts of the Liberian party as a whole are not supported.
A representative of the Liberian Party said, "The four-week work week is not a party policy, and it is not a party.
Chancellor John McDonnell used a work conference last week to express his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald said that he decided to return the power from the "inviolable directors" and "managers" to the community.
The plans of the black office also provide that the current water shareholder may not get back the entire package of shares, as the Government of the Liberian Government may make a "request" on the basis of the alleged violations.
He also confirmed that he was planning to bring employees into company councils and to create joint property funds to hand over 10 percent of the private company's own funds to employees who would hold annual dividends to 500 pounds of sterling.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, told us for "60 minutes," that the FBI, working with Cavano, would have to change its opinion.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Cavano has put the final vote on his election to the Supreme Court at least a week. This raises the question of whether the office of the Republican senators will be able to provide support.
In an interview on Sunday, the 60-minute correspondent, Scott Pauly, asked the Republicans Johnny Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the F.B.R. could reveal anything that could lead to change.
Kennedy turned out to be more open than his colleague from the South Queen.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said, going on a court trip: I spoke to Judge Cavano.
I called him after how it happened, and I asked why the charge was made, and I said, "You did it?"
He was decisive and unique."
The vote of Grem, however, seems final.
"I think Bret Cavano has decided that it will be a scandalous accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Bret firmly rejects it," added Graham, referring to Christina Blaise Ford.
"And all she called could not believe it.
She's only 36 years old.
I don't see anything new."
What is the International Citizens' Festival, and what has been done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York, the International Festival is held: an annual musical event that has a very impressive composition of speakers and performers and a mission to end poverty in the world.
Now, over the course of seven years, the World Civil Society Festival will be held on a large bench of the Central Park, where tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy the Jeanette Jackson, Cardy B and Sean Mendes, as well as to learn about the real purpose of merriment – to stop poverty and to cry by 2030.
The 2012 International Civil Society Festival is a continuation of the Global Project against the Challenge of an International Propaganda Group, which hopes to stop poverty at the expense of increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for merriment (if you don't want to pay the VIP ticket), visitors had to do a series of tasks or "acting right" to be a walnut, to write through the e-mail of the country's leader, to call any other action and to increase their awareness of the end of poverty.
But how successful was the Civil Festival for 12 years and was it able to achieve its goal?
Is it an idea to reward people with a free mall in a real way to convince people of the need for active action, or is it just another case of so-called "climbism" -- people feel that they're doing the right thing by signing online petition or sending tweets?
Since 2011, festival organizers have reported that more than 19 million "actions" have been recorded from their supporters, who seek to achieve different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to push influential leaders to meet their responsibilities for more than $37 billion, which can affect lives more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group introduced 390 comments on responsibilities and made at least 10 billion dollars, which had already been allocated or collected.
According to the group's assessment, the resources provided so far have been directly affected by nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key responsibilities include providing food, partnering with investors and performers based in Great Britain, "helping children develop in full volume", a promise to provide Rwanda $35 million to help prevent malnutrition in the country after obtaining more than 4700 tweets from citizens.
"By supporting the government of Great Britain, donors, national governments and citizens of different countries, we can eradicate social injustice in the history of malnutrition," Ambassador Tracy Ulman said in London in April 2018.
In addition, the group reported that, after more than 5,000 actions were carried out in Great Britain to improve food for furniture and children, the government announced funding for the food aid project to reach 5 million women and children with food problems.
In answer to one of the common questions on the website, "What makes you think we can end poverty?"
The Global Festival answered, "It'll be a long and difficult path, sometimes we'll suffer at once and right."
But like the great civil rights and movements against apartheid, we'll be successful, because together we're stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardie B, Janelle Monae, is one of the number of individuals who are taking part this year in New York City, which will lead to Debara-Le Ferns and Hu Jackman.
US can use VMS for blockage to prevent exports of crude oil and gas
"Washington may, if necessary, contact the Navy to prevent the outflow of racial energy in the EU and the Middle East," said the US Secretary Ryan Zink, Washington Examiner.
Zink argued that Russia's actions in Syria, in particular, where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government, are the basis for a study of new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason for their stay in the Middle East is that they want to acquire energy just as much as in Eastern Europe and South Europe," he said.
And, according to the journalist, there are ways and means of dealing with this.
"The United States has the ability to ensure the openness of the maritime waterways, and, if necessary, to organize the blockade so that their energy may not have hit the market," he said.
The dog was addressed to members of the Merritant, organized by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-commercial group that positions itself as the "voice of Energy Consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they were essentially equal.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more balanced and replaces fuel," he said, calling Russia "a side-by-side country" with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These applications were made at a time when the Trump administration wanted to significantly increase the export of its confused natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which for European consumers is a much more valuable option.
For this purpose, the Tromp administration officials, including US President Donald Tromp himself, are trying to convince Germany to exit the "incorrect" draft of the North Stream 2 newspaper, which, according to the Tromp, has turned Berlin into a "familiar" Moscow.
The mask repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 newspaper cost 11 billion dollars, which is created to boost the power of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to this project is starting in the economy and is an example of uncompromising competition.
"I think we have the only view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers," said Russia Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting the US Energy Minister at the Peruvian Market in Moscow.
The Americans received a hit in response from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German organization, which represents industry, the Federation of German Manufacturers (BDI) has called for the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country is involved in our energy supply," said Diter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Developers (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is going to have a very serious discussion of her participation in the 2020 presidential election, states Senator from Massachusetts
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would seriously consider his participation in the election of the President after the interim election.
During a talk in Halioki's Mary, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering the possibility of his participation.
"It's time for women to head to Washington and order our Sunday government, and I'm also talking about women on the highest seats," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will take it very seriously to consider the possibility of fighting in the president."
During a speech in Mary Warren, he turned to President Donald Trump, saying that he would "be leading the country in the wrong direction."
"I am extremely concerned about what Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his candidate at the Brett Cavan High Court.
On Friday in his tweet, Warren wrote, "Of course, before the poll, it is necessary for the FBI to conduct the investigation."
However, the results of the poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not believe that it should be held in favour of presidents in 2020.
According to a political research centre at the University of Safalk/Bostan Globe, 50 percent of Massachusetts' "possible" voters said that the senator should not be involved.
Thirty-two percent support her decision.
The question showed much support for former Governor Dave Patrick, where 38 percent were for, and 48 percent against.
Other well-known names among the Democrats, which were discussed in connection with the potential battle in 2020, include former vice-president Joe Baiden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press Byden, he officially made a decision until November.
As a result, Donald Trampo Sara Polin mentioned a post-traumatic syndrome of Trek Polin.
26-year-old Trek Polin spent a year in Iraq following his call for true service.
On Monday evening he was arrested and accused of domestic violence
"What goes through to my son after his return, I can compare with the results of the charitable syndrome and the wounds that our soldiers are returning to other families," she said as she came out in support of Donald Trump in Tals, Oklahoma.
Palin called it a "big question" and stated that her son and other war veterans "returning a little to others, being pushed back with the question, whether there is the respect for which the soldiers, the airmen, the other warmen fought, surrendering themselves to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasil, Alaska, and he was charged with domestic violence against women, preventing attempts to report domestic violence, armed robbery, according to information from Dan Bennet, a press secretary of the Police Department of Wasil.
18 states and county of Colombia support the development of a new port policy
Eighteen states and the county of Colombia support a new U.S. policy, which refuses to be a victim of gang pressure or domestic violence at the dock.
The representatives of the 18 states and districts of Colombia fell under an analytical note in Washington on Friday to support the policy of port delivery, NBC News reports.
The full name of the case of Grace against Seshness, which was opened in October by the American Union on civil rights against federal politics, was not revealed.
She said her partner "and his friends with a hard gang" raped her, but on 20 July the US authorities refused to join the dock.
She was detained in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Greece have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, with the largest number of requests for ports in the United States, as countries that have serious gang and domestic violence problems.
The new US port policy changed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Commission, which allowed immigrants without documents that are victims of domestic violence to address the port.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Carl Rainsin, said on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring the decade-long experience of states, countries and the world".
“Federal leadership requires the application to be based on specific facts and circumstances of the case, and such a change violates this principle,” says the analytical note.
Europeans have also stated in a note that a policy that rejects immigrants improves the economy of the United States, saying that immigrants can often become entrepreneurs and "make necessary jobs".
Attorney General Jeff Seshens ordered the judges in June on immigration no longer to allow the docking victim of domestic violence and gang violence.
"The solution is for those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or political views," Seshnes said on 11 June, reporting on this policy.
The port never meant a solution to the problem, even all the serious problems people face around the world every day.
This is a desperate rescue operation in Palau. The number of survivors has doubled as they tried to find it.
Those who survived are in a very difficult situation.
“It’s all very tense,” says a 35-year-old mother of Russ Kusum, dealing with her little son’s temperature at the evacuation center of the wrecked town of Pala.
"Every minute the car 'fast' brings the body.
Pure water is very small."
The lodgers began to return to their broken houses, picking up the craziest things, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 balls were filled.
Some of the wounded, including the number Two Harris, who broke the collar and shoulder, are outside the army hospital of Paul, where patients are being treated on the street because of the strong syringes that are repeated.
His eyes showed tears when he remembered the feeling of strong underground pushes in the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to fight.
I'm stuck under the ruins of the wall," said Harris Associated Press, and added that his family came to the city for marriage.
"I heard her cry for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador blames China for "propagandist threats"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-sided advertisement in the American daily, praising the mutual benefits of the American-Chinese trade, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread the propaganda.
The US President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned China Daily's pay addendum to the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after China's prosecution in an attempt to get involved in the US Congress' election on November 6th.
The accusation that China tried to get involved in the U.S. elections indicated that American officials were calling in a conversation with Reuters a new phase in Washington's company under pressure on China.
Although the placement of a commercial by foreign governments is a normal practice to promote trade, now Beijing and Washington have launched a trade war, resulting in the mutual imposition of import tariffs.
Repressive tariffs, U.S. and Chinese experts, have been introduced to harm such exporters as entrepreneurs from the state of Iowa, who support the Republic of Trump.
Teri Branstad, the US Ambassador to China and the Governor of Iowa, the main exporter of the agricultural industry in China, said that Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, Branstad wrote in the authorial article of the Sunday issue of Des Moines Register, "now doubles its efforts by printing propaganda advertising in our free press."
"By distributing its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a good American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of speech, printing a paid advertisement at Des Moines Register," writes Brand.
"And if you look at the paper bags in Beijing, there you will find not so many votes against and you will not see the real reflection of other opinions that Chinese might have on a dangerous trajectory in the economy, taking into account the fact that the press is under the iron fifth Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most influential Chinese newspapers refused the suggestion" to print his article, although he did not even call it a newspaper.
Republicans repel female pickers from the previous temporary election from the Kawano Fisco, warning analysts
While many well-known republics are defending a warrant for the possession of Supreme Judge Brett Cavano in front of the face of several charges of sexual violence, analysts warned that they would get hit in response, especially from women, during future interim elections.
The emotions around it were very strong, and most of the Republicans already showed that they were ready to vote.
"These things can't be returned," said Grant Rhohir, professor of political science at Maxwell Syracuse University of The Hill, for the article, which was printed on Saturday.
The bishop said that he was not sure that Senator Jeff Flyek's (Arison) statement on the FBI's investigation would be enough to calm down the angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday -- they won't forget it tomorrow and in November," said Karin Jean-Pier, chief advisor and national press secretary of the MoveOn Progression Group in Washington, D.C., on Friday.
On Friday morning, the protesters called for "The Fall Quick!" during a demonstration at the Senate Hall, when the Republicans that control the legal committee decided to cast out Kawano, despite the statement of Dr. Christine Blyce Ford, in agreement with Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the democrats will be extremely great," said a new site, Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
"People say they're already tall, and that's true.
But they can be even higher, especially among women electors in the suburbs and young electors from 18 to 29 years old, who don't even like the president, but often don't vote."
Even before an open application for Ford, in which she detailed her allegations of a warrant in the Criminal Court in sexual violence, analysts believe that if the Republicans will insist on confirmations, there may be a strong impact on the answer.
"For the Republican Party, it has done some kind of a mix," said Michael Stones, who was the head of the National Committee of the Republican Party at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"The talk is not about the voting of the committee or about the final vote, or about whether the Cavano will be held on the property. It is about how the Republicans dealt with it and how they came to it," notes the new Hai Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps choose the Democrats.
However, it's like the Americans are divided into the rights of Ford or Cavano, and a little bit more speaking than the last.
A new question from YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents are sure whether or not they really trust Ford, and 35 percent said that they are sure whether or not they really trust Kavano.
In addition to this 38 percent said that, according to their opinion, the Cavano may or may have failed in its statement, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the Flemish Flemish strike, the Flemish FBI investigates the charges against Ford and, at least, another person, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford made an oath before the Senate's Legal Committee that Cavano, when he was drunk, demanded it at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate at the Supreme Court showed her her genitals at night when they were studying in Eile in 1980.
World Wide Web Founder plans to start a New Internet to create Google and Facebook competitions
The Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world network, launches a startup that will become a Facebook, Amazon, and Google competitor.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built on the open Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows the user to choose where to store the data and who has access to this information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Li, he said that, creating the Inrupt, he meant "the feeling of the world."
"You have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
This program is using Solid to allow people to create their own Internet storage or POD.
This can contain contacts, mailing lists, calendar, banners and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at once on one browser at a time.
The uniqueness of the personal data stored on the Internet is that only a user determines who has access to the information type.
The company calls it "personally strengthening the potential with data."
According to the executive director, John Bruce's idea of creating Inrupt gives the company the opportunity to communicate together resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is now made up of Berners-Li, Bruce, security platforms bought by IBM, several developers working on a contract project and a collaborator.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised programs using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Brenners-Li said that he and his team didn't talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make any changes if all their business models were reviewed instantly.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a Saturday publication on Medium Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt mission "is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems for the protection of the integrity and quality of the new solid network."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet, creating the Consortium of the World Network at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past few months, Bernards-Lee has been very influential in terms of network neutrality.
Even starting Inrupt, Berners-Lee will become the founders and directors of the Consortium of the World Network, the Network Fund and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the new era of the network," said Bernards-Lei.
Bernard Van: honoring a clergyman born by the Victorian Cross in World War I
One of the British Church's shrines, founded by the Victorian Cross during World War I as a combatant, was marked in their city 100 years later.
Colonel Bernard Van was nominated on 29 September 1918 for the role of an ally under the Bellenglais and Leakur.
However, within four days he died of the sniper's bullet and never learned that he had received the highest military award.
On Saturday in the town of Rashden, the county of Nartgemptonshire, two of his grandsons on the parade opened a monumental stone.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "very symbolic", that the stone was opened 100 years after his grandfather was installed.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Van took his battalion through the San Quentin Canal "through a dense angle and under a strong pink and clumsy fire."
Then he ran on the line of fire and "with great boldness" led the soldier forward, grasping the gun himself and selecting three divisions.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, and a little more than a month later the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Van said that his grandfather's actions were "something I could never do and something worth respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also set up a win after the council, which appointed the Imperial young architect Brandwood.
Michael Wan said that "for his great honor to take part in the parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero was demonstrated by the support shown by many."
MMA fans all night waiting to see Bellator 206, they got Pepa's pig instead.
Just imagine, you've stayed all night to see a packaged transmission from Bellator 206, and then you're denied the main event.
There were 13 battles in the program with San-Has, including six on the main card, and they showed up in the direct epherah all night on the British Channel 5.
And the sixth morning, when Gerar Musasi and Rory McDonald were moving to the edge, looking at the Great Britain, they were just joking when the program changed into Pep's pig.
Some were disappointed after having spent an insanity night, especially waiting for this fight.
One of the dancers on Twitter called switching to a child mutiny as "some stupid joke."
In answer to the question of broadcasting Dave Schwartz, the senior vice president Bellator on marketing and communication said, "Consistently the state order and 6 mornings this content was inappropriate and had to be turned into a child program."
"Yes, "Swinka Pepa."
The president of Bellator Scott Kocker's company said that in the future they would work on a program to count British observers.
"I think we're considering the possibility of a repeat, in my opinion, that we can resolve this issue," said Koker.
"But now the sixth morning of Sunday, and we cannot resolve it until Sunday by our time, and it is Monday by their time.
But we're doing everything we can.
Believe me, when the programs changed, we got a lot of messages and they weren't all friendly.
We've tried to solve the question, considering it's a technical error.
But it turned out to be a state order.
I can tell you that the next time it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen.
We're going to reduce the number of strokes from six to five, as we do it usually, this time we wanted to advise fans, but we're getting old.
It's an extreme situation."
"Discs of the Inhuman Islands": Tom Dale felt "little" because of sexuality
The ampician ghost on jumps in Tom Dale's water said that growing with a sense of meaning for others because of their sexuality -- but it gave him motivation on the way to success.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't understand that "not everything is like me," until he went to high school.
Speaking on Radio 4's Radio 4 in the leading Lauren Lavern, he said he supported the gay right to give another "hope".
He also stated that when he had a child, he began to think less of winning the Olympics.
Traditionally leading this pretty old program of Kirsty Yang, took rest for a few months because of the disease.
In the role of a man who found himself on an island without a human being, on the first programme of Lawrence, Dale said that in childhood he felt "less" than everyone else, because "the society didn't take those who liked both boys and girls."
He said, "I now think that this feeling that you're not like everything or nothing was what gave me the strength and inspiration to succeed."
He wanted to prove that there was a "whore," he said, so he didn't disappoint those who learned about his sexuality.
A two-fold bronze example of the Olympics was made by a significant LGBT movement activist and at the Societies in Australia this year called on countries not to criminalize homosexuals.
He said he expressed his opinion because he was happy to live openly without persecution and wanted to give hope to others.
A three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man -- an American scriptwriter, director and lecturer, Dustin Lance Blake, who met in 2013 -- "it was unexpected for me."
Dale married the owner of Oscar, who was 20 years older than him last year, but, in his words, the difference in age doesn't matter.
"When you're going through this in such a young age," he said, "at the first album, he was 14 years old, and in three years, his father died of cancer, he said it was hard to find a rabbi who would survive such an upheaval and event.
In June they became parents, their son called Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Dale said that his "perspective entirely" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would tell you that I need to win the gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are things in the world that are more important than the gold of the Olympic medal.
Robbie is my gold alimpic medal."
His son is also called his father Robert. His father died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Dale said that his father did not accept the fact that he died and one of the last things he asked was whether they bought tickets at the 2012 London Olympics – he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you won't sit in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he was not immortal," he said.
Next year, Dale joined the 2012 championship and won the bronze medal.
“I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – jumping in water in front of my dancers in the Alpine games, it’s the best feeling,” he said.
It also affected the choice of song – Proud from Hezer Small – which found a guide in it in preparation for the Olympics and from which the ants are now running.
"Discs of a non-human island" can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m. on British summer time.
Mikelson, who is not in shape, stays on the bench of the spare in Ryder's cup on Saturday
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th game in the Rider's cup, but he needs to return the form so that this event doesn't get unlucky.
Michelson, who's going to play in this co-operation, which takes place once every two years, the 12th, the captain of the team, Jim Furick, has been sitting on the bench for the Saturday meal.
Instead of being in the center of events, and he was there often for the United States team, the five-time winner of the Cup divided his days between the work of the cyclist and the training, hoping to return to form.
Even at the peak of his career he wasn't the best player, and now a 48-year-old golfer is not the ideal choice for an awkward Le Golf National field, where the wrong blows are severely punished.
And if the field itself is not dark enough, Mikelson in the ninth match on Sunday will fight against the exact British Open French Malinarian champion, who won all four matches this week along with Tommy Fletwood.
If Americans who stay at four points at the beginning of the 12 single battles begin with success, the Michelson match may prove extremely important.
Fury expressed confidence in this player, but nothing else could say.
"He fully understood his role today, slapped me on my back, taunted me, and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furick.
"He is very confident in himself.
He was taken to the Hall of Glory and gave a very many command in the past and this week.
Maybe I didn't plan it on two matches.
I was planning more, but I was working just like that and we were thinking about playing.
He wants to be in the field, as well as everyone else."
Mikelson beat Nick Fald's record by the number of matches in the Rider's cup played on Sunday.
It could be the end of a career in Ryder's cup, which was never the same as achievements in individual games.
In Mikelson, 18 won, 20 won, and seven and a half won, although Furrick said his presence brought benefits.
"He's funny, sarcastic, with humor, likes to joke about people and just a very good man who has a good team," he explained.
"I think that the younger players with the pleasure of parading his jokes, too, this week, and it was good to see.
He gives command much more than just a game."
The Captain of the European Command Thomas Burn knows that a big break may soon disappear
Thomas Burne, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant break before the individual games of the last day on the Rider's cup could easily disappear.
A Dutch debut player in Walderam in 1997 where a European team under the direction of Seva Balestera was privileged in five points above the Americans, but was funded with a minimum of 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
"You always remind yourself that in Valderam we had a great advantage and won, but with difficulty, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where they lost," said Burn after viewing how the Class of 2018 had won 5-3 and Friday, and yesterday, and brought the number 10-6 to Le Golf National.
"History shows me and everyone else in command that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow you have to play at all of the hundred.
Go out in the field and do everything right.
Until the points appear in the table, nothing's finished.
We have a goal, and this is an attempt to win this prize, that's what we're going to focus on.
I say this all the time, I'm familiar with 12 players on our side, but we understand very well that on the opposite side there are the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the playing of his players in the hard field for golf, Burne added, "I will never judge myself in this.
Tomorrow will be a completely different game.
Tomorrow will be individual games, and that's quite different.
It's just great if you're in a field with a partner and it's all going well, but if you're playing one, here's proof of your real golfer talents.
That's what we need to tell the players that they have to show tomorrow the best.
Now you have to leave your partner, you have to go and show the best as an individual player."
Unlike Burne, his rival Jim Furick is looking for the best individual game of his sportsmen than the one they demonstrated in partnership, except for Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
Furik himself was on both sides of these matches the last day, playing in a victorious command in Brooklyn and losing, when Europe had a "Wood in Medina."
"I remember every word of it," he said, answering the question, as Ben Crencho, Captain of 1999, set up his players for the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but always want to have a quick start that you saw in Brooklyn and in Medina.
When the speed rises, the greatest pressure is the one playing the ball in the middle.
We set up a proper schedule and put the players as we liked it, and we're going to try to get some magic tomorrow."
Thomas had the task of starting to play and speaking against Rory McCillroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Roose, John Ram, Tommy Fletwood and Jan Paulter would play against the diving golfers.
"I've put my players in such order, because I think I'm closing it all up," said Burne about his choice for individual matches.
The start of a new German military ship has been postponed
The new WMF fragment Germany had to enter the rig in 2014 to replace old warships of the Cold War, but it will appear not earlier than next year due to the inconvenient systems and the ever-increasing cost of local media.
The Rhineland-Pfalz, a major ship of the entirely new Baden-Wuerttemberg Freight Class, was transferred to the first half of 2019, as Die Zeit wrote, quoting the military representative.
The ship had to enter the rig in 2014, but the problems that arose after the construction hampered this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg military ships, which were ordered in 2007, have to replace the old Bremen Freight.
They'll be armed with powerful gears, various anti-corrosive and Zenite missiles, as well as with some "Steels" technologies, such as reduced visibility for radars, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Among other important features – longer periods between telecommunications – more new frescoes may not enter their ports for two years.
However, constant delays mean that modern warships -- which can allow Germany to demonstrate their power beyond the country -- will expire until they finally come into power, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 fragment hit the headlines last year, when the German WMF officially refused to take the ship and returned its Verfi Blohm & Voss to Hamburg.
For the first time, the Marine fleet returned the ship to the shore after delivery.
The reasons for the return were, of course, small, but German media have written about many of the “defects in software and equipment” that make the ship empty in the war mission.
The lack of software was particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships have only 120 sailors -- half the crew of the old Bremen frigates.
It also found that the ship has a very large weight, which reduces its productivity and limits the possibility of further updates.
Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice the weight of the ships of a class that used Germany in World War II.
In addition to the lack of cost allocation of the whole project, including crew training, there is also a problem.
The price reached an incredible level of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) -- although it initially amounted to 2.2 billion euros.
The problems associated with the new frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's marine power is decreasing.
Early this year, Hans-Peter Bartells, head of the German parliament's defence committee, stated that the IMF "has fewer and fewer ships capable of military missions".
He said that the problem sometimes increases because old ships are listed, and there are no ships to replace.
He complained that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg's members could join the IMF.
National Society for Memory Listened to the Secret Life of Talks
A new research conducted in Scotland's mountains is aimed at identifying how they use the landscape in hunting for food.
Scientists are hoping to find something new in the behaviors of the unique flying dairy and helping in future actions to preserve these animals.
The research of scientists at the National Society of Custody of Scotland is carried out by small bats and also by long bullfights of Dabanton in the Inver Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be located in the main locations of this location to watch the speakers' actions during the season.
Society workers and walnuts will be conducting mobile research using manual detectors.
An expert analysis of the sounds of all the records will determine the frequency of the speakers' calls, as well as the speakers who say what they're doing.
The map of life and the report will be used to create a detailed picture of the behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Slave Duar, an advisor to the National Society for Nature Conservation, hopes that the results will show what are the most important areas for speakers and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the advantages of creating habitats such as people, and how to support forests for the survival of bats and other related animals.
The number of speakers in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased considerably in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects and destroys the habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can be a risk, as well as bats for flies and some chemicals for building materials, and they're threatened by domestic cats.
It's said quite not blind.
However, because of their nightlife the ears spoke more sensitive than the eyes when the talk was about hunting.
They use a complex elation technique to detect bumps and obstacles along the flight path.
National society, which accounts for more than 270 buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land all over the country, is very serious about talking.
It's a team of ten scientists who regularly do research, check their place of residence, and sometimes rescue mermaids.
The organization even created the first and only Scottish speaker of speeches in the Triv coin in Domfris and Galavey, where eight of the ten species of chattels live.
The head of David Thompson's coin says it's an ideal territory for speakers.
"Here, in Troy, we just have a great place for speakers," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and a very good place to live.
But we don't know much about the speakers yet, so our work here and in other monkeys will help us to understand what they need for a better life."
It underlines the importance of checking the presence of speakers before the property is repaired, since one seat can be deliberately destroyed by killing up to 400 male and young speakers, which will lead to the complete destruction of the local population.
They are under shelter and are forbidden to kill, scare, worry or destroy their seats.
Elizabeth Farall, a member of the Organization's organization for a talk in Scotland, calls on the public to help in this matter.
She says, "We need to learn a lot more about our speakers, and we don't even know how their populations live."
Ranalda pleads charges of rape, and his lawyers are going to court in German history.
Kristian Ranald called his accusations in a rape of "face news," saying that people want to "advertise themselves", using his name.
His lawyers are going to court at the German journal Der Spiegel, who published these charges.
The Forvard of the Congregation of Portugal and Euventus was accused of rape by US Catherine Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Then if he had paid her $375 000 for silence, he wrote on Friday Der Spiegel.
In the video Instagram Live 33-year-old Ranald addressed 142 million of his subscribers a few hours after the prosecutions were published, calling this message "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today's messages are fake news," said Gold Ball's five-time owner in front of the camera.
"They want to make an ad on my behalf.
It's okay.
They want to be known by mentioning my name, but it's part of my work.
I am a happy and good man," he added with a smile.
Jurists ranald's trial against Der Spiegel's journal on the charges that were called "inconvenient messages of suspicion in the private case," Reuters reported.
A lawyer, Christian Shertz, said that the player would need compensation for the "moral damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the violation of rights, and in recent years it may be the most serious violation of personal rights."
If there was an incident in June 2009, the luxury of the Palms Hovtel and Casinov Hotel in Las Vegas.
Meeting in a nightclub ranald and Major would have returned to the footballer's room, where he would have raped her anonymously, as written in the documents of the district court of Clark County in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after that, Ranald withdrew and said that at "99 percent" he was a "good boy" who suffers from "one percent".
The documents confirm that Ranalda admitted that they had sex, but on the right side.
Major also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of the damage in the hospital, but then she agreed to the extrajudicial arrangement, because she was "very afraid of revenge" and uneasy that she was "publicly humiliated."
A 34-year-old woman says she wants to reinstate the charge, because she feels a moral trauma in that case.
At the time, if Ranaldo had the case, he was going to go to Madrid's "Real" from Manchester United, and this summer he went to Italy's "Yventus", closing the deal at 100 million euros.
BRITAIN: Britain's "always sorry" for the loss of automobile manufacturers
The Great Britain "will always regret" when it loses its world car leader's status after Brexit, said the Minister of Business, Greg Clarke.
He added that his "comfort" statement by Toyota UK to BBC about the fact that if Britain leaves the EU without consent, the company will temporarily cut production in Bernston, near Derby in half.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that a delay in the limit resulting from Brexit could lead to a reduction in the workplace.
In Bernston, where Toyota Auris and Avensis are made, nearly 150,000 cars were released last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the Eurosause.
"In my view, when Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March, it will produce at our trade stop," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Bernston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom raised the question of how the cross-border trade will be carried out when Britain leaves the EU without consent, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problem is that car manufacturers are talking about the risk of chains of mail resulting from Brexit's unremembered.
Toyota's production line works on the basis of "precisely within a time limit" when spare parts come every 37 minutes from suppliers both in Great Britain and in the EU for the cars that are being ordered.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without a reminder, there may be a breach that will lead to delays and a lack of resources.
For Toyota it would be impossible to keep on working in Derby more than a day's spare part, said the company, so to produce a stop.
Mr. Clarke said that the Plan of Checkers, Teresa May, about future relations with the EU, was "made exactly so as to avoid these border checks".
"We need a deal, we want to get the best deal that will not only allow the success of today, but also allow us to take advantage of this opportunity," he said in Today's BBC Radio 4.
"The information we receive not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, indicates that we must be able to continue the work of successful lines of supply."
Toyota's company couldn't tell how long it won't work for production, but on the future warning that added costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and reduce jobs.
Peter Chowalaris, a 24-year-old worker in Bernston who is the trade coordinator, said that the trade union members are very concerned: "After all, if the jobs are cut off, they will not be renewed.
The president of the government said, "We have proposed an accurate plan of our future relations with the EU that deserves trust."
The white house says that the Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again
The very important meeting of Donald Trump with Assistant Attorney General Rodham Rosenstein may be "deposited for a week", while the struggle around the stand at the Brett Cavano Supreme Court said on Sunday, a Belgian representative at home.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Advisor Robert Muller, who studies the involvement in the elections on Russia's side, the relations of Tromp's assistants with Russia and the potential obstacle to justice on the part of the President.
To release the Trump assistant general's attorney or not, and thus put Muller's independence at risk, for months, pour oil into the fire of your Washington fleet.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had been considering the possibility of taking a hidden microphone to record talks with Trump, and the possibility of withdrawing the president from the seat with the help of 25 amendments.
Rosenstein turned it over.
But last Monday he went to the White House in the middle of a rumor about what was going to fall off.
Instead, it was announced that there would be a meeting with Trump on Thursday, which was at the AAN headquarters in New York.
Trump said he "wouldn't want" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid encounters at the Senate's legal committee, where Kavana and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation against Cavano, which further slowed the vote in the Senate.
The Sara Sanders Trump Press release appeared in the Fox News Sunday Sunday Sunday Sunday program.
When she was asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "The date may not be scheduled for this week, perhaps next week.
But everything's going to happen, and I always give the latest news."
Some journalists are willing to accept her statement: Sanders did not give the press briefings in the White House on 10 September.
Leading the program Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the frequency of briefings is called don't ignore the reporters who "work for the public," even though she added, "I agree with the fact that they work for the public."
Then she said that indirect contact with the Trump and the press would increase.
"The president met more with the answers to the press questions than any president who was with him," she said, adding without specific facts: "We have studied these numbers."
The briefings are taking place, reported Sanders, but "if the press has a chance to ask directly the questions of the President of the United States, it's much better than doing it through me.
We've been trying to do this a lot, you've seen how we've been doing this in the last few weeks.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or takes part in meetings on the street or in press conferences with high foreign guests.
The president's own press conferences are rare.
This week, the President of New York demonstrated why, if free and sometimes extraordinarily, he appeared in front of reporters.
Minister of Health wrote to an EU worker in Scotland's health care system in front of Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to an EU health worker who works in Scotland's health system to express his gratitude for the country's name and wish them to stay after Brexit.
Jean Freeman sent a letter less than half an hour before leaving the EU.
The Scottish government is already ready to cover the cost of EU citizens living in state services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "The talks between the United Kingdom and the EU have been ongoing over the years, leading to the expected decisions of this autumn.
But the British government also hurried preparation for the script without a mention.
I know that for all of you this is a very restless time.
So I want to remind you how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of his nationality.
My colleagues from all over the EU and not only give valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health care service, also benefit patients and our communities.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay with us."
Cristian Abercromby carried a temporary operation after a head injury
Linebacker Command Tennessee State Tigers Christian Abercromby has carried out a temporary operation after having suffered a head injury in a Sunday match, which his command has lost 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Master Coach Tennessee State Rod Red told the reporter that the trauma of the player had been interrupted shortly before.
"He went over to the sideline and suddenly fell," said the Lord.
Trainers and doctors gave Abercombi oxygen still on the field before putting it on the force and carrying it to fix the diagnosis.
The Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris from the WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated at the medical center of Vanderbilt.
Harris added that there was no "further about what trauma was," and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the player got the trauma.
Aarcombi, a fellow sportsman, runs the first Tennessee State season after he leaves Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he made five full seizures, which gives a total of 18 seizures per season.
External British real estate buyers will pay for the bulk of their mail
In line with the new plans of conservators, foreign British real estate buyers will pay a higher order, and additional money will go to help the homeless
This action neutralizes the success of the Corbin initiative by attracting young voters
An increase in the amount of State aid is due to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance plans to get up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Today, Teresa May announce that foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher government mission, and additional money will go to help the homeless.
This action is considered to be an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's initiative by attracting young voters, as well as the availability of living quarters. It is directed at people with high incomes.
An increase in the government's post is directed at individuals and companies that don't pay taxes in Great Britain, and the money they get will go to the government's living program for the homeless.
The expansion of the current state mission, including a higher level, adopted two years ago, for the purchase of other houses and dwellings for rent, could amount to three percent.
The finance ministry expects to get up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13 percent of the new builders in London buy non-residents in Great Britain, which leads to price increases and a new buyer is making it difficult to buy his first living.
Many rich regions of the country -- particularly the capital -- have become "privileged gardens," because a large number of customers, because of the majority of the time, do not live in Great Britain.
The new policy came literally a few weeks after Barris Johnson's call to reduce the state mission for young buyers to facilitate the acquisition of the first dwelling.
He accused a huge construction firm of holding high prices for real estate by taking up the land and not using it, and urged me to cancel the quotas on the available living room to make the "glorious living room" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of lively reforms, including the monitoring of rents and the halting of the "no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no.
He also wants to convey to local council more powers in the area of construction of the dwelling.
Mrs. May said, "Last year, I have stated that I will devote my work to the presidency of the Prime Minister for the Renewal of the British Dream -- life for every new generation must be better.
It means improving our incapacitated housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
But it's unfair that people who don't live in Great Britain and foreign companies can buy real estate as easily as British workers.
For too many people dream of having their own home become increasingly incapacitated, and the problem of the homeless remains very real."
Jack Ross: "My main ambition is to run the Scottish community."
Coach Sanderland Jack Ross said his main ambition was to ever become a coach of the Scottish community.
42-year-old Scottish performs the task of restoring the club from the north east, which is now in the third place of the First League, in three points from the first.
He moved on to this work in the summer, after returning Saint Mary to the Scottish league in the last season.
"I wanted to speak for my country as a player.
But it didn't work," said Ross in a BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"I grew up often sick of Scotland at the Hampden Stadium with my father, and something always made me come back.
But that's the chance to show up if I'm a successful club coach."
Among the predecessors of Ross are the Sanderland Coach Dick Advocacy, David Mois, Sam Alardeis, Martin O'Neil, Roy Kein, Gus Poye, and Paul the Canyon.
The former coach Aloa Atletik said he was not afraid of such famous names in such a big club, before rejecting the suggestions from Barnes and the World Cup.
"Now I'll be happy to answer the question, 'Will I be able to get this club back to Prime Minister Ligue?'
According to the structure and material base of the club its place is certainly in Prime Minister Lize," he said.
"It's not just to get him back there, but I'll think of my job as a success only if I can get the club back there."
Ross only worked as a coach for three years, so far he was an assistant coach at Dambarton and worked for 15 months at the Harts training station.
Then he helped Aloa come back from the third league and turn Saint-Mieren from a failure that almost hit the Championship in the next season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than in his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlopoulos, Falkirku, Saint Maryn and Hemilton Academic.
Reflecting on the work at Aloa, he said, "It was a really important choice."
"I really believed that training was what I needed, even more than a game.
Sounds amazing, because I worked well, well earned and reached a certain height.
But the game can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to do every week.
I'm going through it now when you talk about stress and pressure, but training is what you need.
I've always wanted to train and I'm doing it now, and it's the best time for me for all my adult life."

Researched the perfect time to drink a pint of beer – 17:30 a.m.
The hot summer increased the profits of British pubs fighting for survival, but brought pressure on the network of restaurants.
According to the statistics of the B & Bs, sales increased by 2.7 percent in July, but sales decreased by 4.8 percent in restaurants.
Peter Martin of the CGA's consulting business group, which collected this statistics, said, "The solar weather and the longer it was expected to be going on in the English community at the World Championship final, which means that what happened in July was what happened in June when the pubs increased by 2.8 percent, and here the restaurants suffered even more.
Reduced sales in restaurants by 1.8 percent in June, only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars that mainly sell drinks until they show the best result in contrast to restaurants.
The pubs, which sell more food, also burned down in the sun, although not as strong as the restaurants.
It looks like people just wanted to drink.
In the pubs and bars, the sale of drinks grew by 6.6 percent, and the sale of food decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, an RSM analyst on rest and accommodation, said, "These results are a trend that we see at the end of the day.
The weather and the effects of important social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales volumes in the public food market.
It's not surprising that the restoratives continue to compete, because sales have dropped by 4.8 percent a year, and it's very unpleasant if the cost continues to grow.
The long and hot summer has come at the most ceptic time for operators focused on food, and time will show whether lower temperatures in October will bring such expected relief."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including recently opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the release of fires.
The tool to track sales in British pubs, bars and restaurants Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyzes productivity data from 47 active groups with a total cost of 9 billion pounds, and is an important approach to this branch.
Every fifth child has a secret account in the networks it hides from his parents
The study showed that every fifth child – something only happened 11 – has secret accounts in networks that they hide from parents and teachers.
Studying 20,000 high school students showed the increase in Facebook Insta pages
It's the news of fear that there's sexual content
Twelve percent of students say they have a parent account
Every fifth child -- someone only had 11 -- creates accounts in networks that keep them secret from their parents.
A study of 20,000 high-school students revealed a rapid increase in Facebook Insta accounts, which would lead to the Instagram photo exchange site.
It's the news of fear that there's sexual content.
Twelve percent of the students said that they would have clean, basic, accounts to show their parents, and that they would also have private accounts.
One mother who accidentally found a secret site for her 13-year-old daughter learned that she had called on others to "shock me."
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and a conference of independent school directors (HMC) found that 40 percent of teenagers between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted that they had secret accounts.
HMC's head, Mike Buchanan, said, "It's very worrying that so many teenagers want to create places on the Internet where they won't be found by parents or teachers."
Elid Doyle will be a sportsman's voice in the Scottish Council of Light Athletics.
Elid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Council of Light Athletics as a member of the Board of Directors at the annual general meeting of this body.
Doyle is the most titled easy-to-read skater in Scotland and H.E.B.I. has described this event as a great opportunity for those who run sports to get a lot of benefit from her experience at different levels, which is an international figure for the past decade.
"The militia is used with great respect in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world's sports community, and we're sure that a lightweight athlete in Scotland will get a lot of benefit from her work in the council," said Beatie.
Doyle said, "I want to act as a sportsman's voice, and I hope that I will help manage sports in Scotland."
An American who won gold at 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and two more gold medals at the other Olympics, and who is now an expert on BBC, can't walk after a microsault has survived.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I survived a blow.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it'd only be time to show me or I'll fix it to what extent.
It was a hard work, but I completely improved, learned to walk again and now I'm practicing in the corner!
Thank you for the support message!"
A small pump advertising where mothers are compared to cows has shared their views on the Internet
The small-pump production company divided its opinion by issuing an ad comparing feeding women with the cows that they give.
To mark the launch of what they call "the world's first-aided small pump," the consumer company Elvie released an Iranian music commercial on the basis of a video to show the freedom it gives to a nursing mother.
Four real mothers dance in the cool with the cow under the song, where there are the words, "Yes, I give myself, but the tail I don't have" and "In case you haven't noticed, it doesn't smell, it's my breast."
And she said, "Come, let me feed my children, let me give my women."
However, an advertisement, which was posted on Facebook's website, triggered a heated discussion on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments. The video reaction was undisputed, and many said it was scary little production.
"It is a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must stop and order to give milk, here's only their children going in a few days," wrote one viewer.
Elvie's milk pump is indiscriminately hidden in herbicides (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: "She understood in a traumatic way both for her mother and for her child.
But why not use them for advertising a small pump for a mother with no children?"
Someone said, "That's an unplanned advertisement."
Others defended the ad, and one woman wrote that she thought the song was fun.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd like to have that if I had breast-feeding.
Respiration of the milk makes me feel a cow.
It's a little crazy commercial, but I liked it.
It's a brilliant product," she wrote.
Another comment: "A very fun advertisement directed at a mother that detachs milk pumps (usually at the workplace or in the toilet) and hears themselves as "cows."
It doesn't approve of advertising and does not condemn small-scale industries."
At the end of the video, a group of women showed that they were all dancing with invisible tiny pumps hidden in the bristles.
The concept of a advertising company is based on the fact that many women who use small pumps feel like they're being killed.
However, the Elvie Pump pump is completely idle, has no rights, no pipes and is inextricably hiding in the brigades for feeding women, gives women freedom of movement, allows them to keep children and even leave home while working on the device.
Ana Balarin, a partner and creative director of Mother's company, observed: "Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a remarkable and corrective start.
Conducting a parallel between feeding women and small cows, we wanted to pay attention to the sucking of the milk and its difficulty, while demonstrating the fun and pleasant way in which the new small pump takes the extraordinary freedom of movement.
It's not the first time Elvie's tiny pump is in the center of attention.
During the London week the mother's fashion of two children appeared on the floor in clothes from Martha James, using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children without a rainy noise transport into a residential camp on a techno limit
Although the number of crossings in the month was almost unchanged, the number of children in detention increased sharply, partly because of the harsh rhetoric and politics of the Trump administration, which hampered the placement of children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are illegal immigrants who are afraid to put their own home in the country, taking responsibility for the child.
The risks increased considerably in June, when federal authorities announced that a potential sponsor and other senior members of the household owners would need to fall into the image of their fingers and data would be handed over to the immigration authority.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a senior member of the Immigration and Laundry Service, presented a report to Congress on the arrests of dozens of people who were asked to sponsor minors without assistance.
Later, the agency reported that 70% of those arrested had no conscience.
"Some 80 percent of the individuals who are sponsors or members of their household owners are illegal in the country, and much of them constitute aliens with a criminal past.
That is why we continue to pursue such people," said Mr. Olbens.
In order to speed up the treatment of children, journalists introduced new rules that require some to appear in court for a month from the date of detention, and thus, according to shelter workers, the earlier standard period was 60 days.
A large number of people are going to use video-relationships instead of being present in a private court.
Those who have no basis for support will quickly be removed.
According to shelter workers and a message from sources in a system that has appeared over the past few months, the longer children remain in detention, the higher the likelihood of depression or increased anxiety that could lead to the outbreaks of violence or the attempts to flee.
The lawyers say that in more massive institutions, such as Tarnilla, these problems are found to be much stronger, as the signs of the child being in a state of hunger are likely to be ignored by the size of the facility.
They add that moving children into a residential town without providing time for emotional preparation or for a discussion with friends can make the trauma that many have already faced.
Syria requires immediate withdrawal of the US, France and Turkey
In return for the AAN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Valid al-Mual has also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war that continues in the country for eight years.
The speech, which is also an intermediary of the Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces are on the Syrian land illegally, on the basis of a fight against terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must leave immediately without any conditions," he said at a meeting of the Assembly.
The speech insisted that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people died since 2011, and millions of people had to leave their homes, “war on terrorism is practically over”.
He announced that Damascus intends to continue "to carry on this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and "love of illegal outside presence".
There are about 2,000 U.S. soldiers in Syria, who primarily play the role of instructors and advisers in the forces of Kurds and Syrian Arabs, who are opposed to President Bashar Assad.
France's earthly contingent in this broken war country consists of more than 1,000 soldiers.
According to refugees, the conditions for return are favourable and they have accused "some Western countries" of "spreading ironic fears" that contain refugees abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to possess their return," he says.
"They are policing a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be helped to renew until the political agreement on the end of the war between Assad and the opposition is reached.
AAN diplomats report that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last major resistance of the Idlib rebels created an opportunity for political talks.
The Russian-Turkey memorial prevented a wide range of Syrian forces supported by Russia in a nation where three million people live.
However, Mulam stressed that the agreement had "precise terms", and expressed hope that military action would be directed against the Gnostic, including the number of bees associated with the Al-Qaeda Front of Nusra, which will be "destroyed".
AAN Stefan de Mistor's envoy is hoping to call for the first seats of a new committee, which will bring in government representatives and opposition to develop a post-consistency for Syria and pave the way for elections.
The speaker outlined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the committee should be limited to "viewing the articles of the current constitution", and cautioned against being involved.
Why Trump would go on a second term
So Mr. Trump will win in the 2020 elections when, as many liberal observers hope, the impication and scandal do not eventually complete his presidency.
And this will no doubt be "the only dramatic end of the presidency in all history!"
At this point, there is no sign of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, ratings in the premium period have grown more than twice – up to 1.05 million per CNN and nearly three times – up to 1.6 million per MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, in Fox News, an average of 2.4 million viewers per hour compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC channel's "The Rachel Maddow Show" broadcast brought 3.5 million viewers to the screen and exceeded cable television ratings in the evening when the headlines were broadcast.
"This is a fire to which people are drawn, because we don't understand it," says Neil Barr, director of the ABC drama "Peraemnik" about the Cabinet member of ministers who become president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
In Nellie Scowell, the site of the screenplay comedy and the authors of the book "A couple of funny details and a couple of tough truths about getting into the club of Hollywood boys," there are other theories.
She mentions a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he's making me happy," said Miss Scowell to me.
Chaos is still precious, and that may be entertaining.
Of course, unlike the rest of the television, the federal lines that come out of Washington can become as definite a future as the road to Wade's case, depending on whether the family of immigrants can unite and healthy the world economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you look at the sixth hour as a group of experts commenting on the use of Bob Woodworth 'not for printing' in the book Strah, the short Paul Manafort for $15,000 with strutskin leather (the clothing, the brunt of pride, as written in The Washington Post), and the consequences of the harsh descriptions of Storm Daniels, the anatomy of Mr. Tramp, it goes beyond the mere desire to be in the course of the race.
I, for example, will never look at Super Mario as much as I used to.
"Part of what he does makes you feel like you're looking at the reality of the show he shows every evening," says Brand Montgomery, executive director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the Pawn Stars on the variable art set of the Trump Show and the constant turning of the League (Sparing with the NFL, approval by Kim Chen.).
You can't let yourself skip even one episode, otherwise you'll stay out of the trend.
When I spoke to Mr. Fles this week, behind the windows of his house on the north shore of the Kauai stood a hot sunday and 30 degrees hot, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC while writing CNN.
He couldn't give up, not when Brett Cavan got up before the Senate's judicial committee, considering the future of the Supreme Court, which hung on a rope.
"I remember the girls when we released these crazy shows, and people said, "This is the beginning of Western civilization," said Mr. Fles.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out that they were right."

External cash flows fall into a severe pre-selective race of interim choices in the representatives' room
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th election district has created a cash market, thanks to the change in the boundaries of Congress's districts, two candidates participate in the election for one place.
The recently repatriated Pre-Major district of Pittsburgh is surrounded by a democrat, a member of the Chamber of Representatives of Konar Lemba, who won his place in another district in the past spring.
Lembo is opposed to another acting deputy, the Republic of Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th county of Pennsylvania, which is largely in line with the new 17th.
The maps were re-imagined after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in the summer held that the voices of the old areas were unconstitutionally counted for the benefit of the Republicans.
The pre-election race in the new 17th district led to a decline in the funding of the company by the main parties' groups, the Democratic Company's Congress Committee (CDC) and the National Committee of the Republican Company (NCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory over the wide-lit candles in the 18th district of Pennsylvania in March.
This place has been occupied by the Republic for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump has won a 20-point strike.
Political experts have a small advantage over the democratics.
The United States appreciated Salvador's support for China, and then withdrew.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already supported the position of Beijing, despite minor opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump met with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Warell in June 2017 and settled in a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Tromp Command.
Representatives of the State Department decided to respond to US leaders of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in connection with "the recent decisions on Taiwan's non-recognition," said Herzer Nawert's secretary at the beginning of this month.
However, sanctions were only seen in El Salvador, which received about $140 million in American aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include a reduction in financial assistance and targeted restrictions on issuing visas, would be painful for the country of Central America with its high level of unemployment and murder.
As soon as internal meetings were completed, North and Central America representatives postponed the conference at a high level, dedicated security and economic prosperity, which would continue to be an analogous meeting in the past year, which was assessed as a step in preventing immigration in the United States.
But by the middle of September, the senior officials of the administration continued to understand that they wanted the conference to take place and actually stopped discussing the question of the El Salvador punishment.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pension will now attend a conference, which will be held in mid-October, in the sign that the administration is in charge of entrepreneurship.
And three American envoys without a rainy noise returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new cruel envoys or punishments from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate that had been described by three American journalists, including the number of two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues while preserving anonymity.
Their messages are confirmed by others, close to the administration by analysts, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
Learn History
The next step can be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Muller on the possible obstacle to justice by Mr. Tramp, which currently has very difficult evidence in public documents.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller has taken note of the investigation into the possibility of winning the Trump and Russia in an election.
If Congress changes the master, Mr. Trump stops before the face of responsibility before this body, just as he is about to speak before the voters again, and perhaps eventually before the jury with the number of his colleagues.
There's a lot of kali, and I don't want to say that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, just like he's in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, have to make a choice that determines how long the struggle will take.
In 1938, the German officers were ready for a coup against Hitler, if only the West had ordered him to oppose and support the Czechs in Munich.
We've suffered a failure and missed the opportunity to avoid the coming years of bloodshed.
History revolves around such fragile moments, and the unmistakable march of democracy is driven or postponed.
Right now the Americans have faced a few of these fragile moments.
What happens when Mr. Trump disbands the mediator of General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls Mr. Muller's fate?
Rosenstein found himself in a difficult position since the paper wrote about what he had suggested last year to write down the president's words in secret and consider his propriety.
Mr. Rosenstein says the translation "The Times" is not correct.
"How will we react if the recently asked FBI investigation of Brett Kwan case is not universal or fair, or if it is confirmed in the Criminal Court, despite the fact that the charges against sexual violence and inconsistencies are well placed?
And first of all, will we vote in favour of Congress, which will attract Mr. Trump to responsibility?
If we don't pass these tests, the long winter will come to democracy.
But I believe that we will not give thanks for the lesson I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Hebrew who was deported to Asvenci by the same Nazi regime that once bought my peace house.
She survived, played in America, and after 60 years, she sent me to light Saturday candles on this table with a satchel.
With such a legacy, how can I not be an optimist in relation to our future?"
Norman Ezen, senior scientific associate of the Brookings Institute, senior organization of the city of responsibility and ethics with the headquarters of Washington and the author of the book "Last Palace: a violent century of Europe in five lives and one legendary house."
Gram Dorans from Rangers is an optimistic front-end match from Rapid Vienna.
Rangers take Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over Austrians after an impressive night in Spain over William in the beginning of this month will allow them to safely leave the G League of Europe.
Trauma's knee prevented the half-story of Greme Dorans from reaching the 2-2 season with "Villary", but he believes that "Randers" can be used as a trampline.
"It was an important match for us, because "Villareal" is a strong rival," says a 31-year-old footballer.
"We started the game, thinking we could get something, and made a point.
Maybe at the end we could kill the ball, but the whole night also became a good result.
They looked better in the first time, but in the second we took ourselves in hand, and we had the best half field.
Thursday will be another important one for European football night.
I hope we can earn three points, but it's going to be a complicated game, because they showed a good result in the last game, but with a crowd of spectators on the courts, I'm sure we can handle them and show them a good game.
Last year was a difficult one, both because of my injuries and the change in the club itself, but now we have a confidence factor.
The command is good, and the boys really get pleasure from the game; training is productive.
I hope we can move forward, win the last season and make a success."
Women lose sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the participants had an accurate understanding of what they wanted to care for, a few of them talked about it with members of their families.
About half of the people who participated in community research have been informed that they talked to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want family members to take care of them, but they don't take steps to discuss it," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Insurance Agency.
That's what it's worth to start with.
Consider it with your husband and children: your family will not be ready to help you if you do not listen to your wishes in advance.
Work with the consultant and the family and consider where and how to get medical help, because this choice can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Draws a financial consultant's discussion. It can also help you to find ways to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy that helps cover these expenses, or you can self-insurance your life – provided you have money.
Deal with legal documents: provide court battalies.
Get periodicity on medical care to assign a regular person to control your medical care and to ensure that your special needs are met if you can't talk.
Consider, too, the possibility of being trusted in financial management.
Assign a periodic person to make financial decisions and to ensure that you pay your bills if you are inactive.
Don't forget about the details: Imagine that your old father needs immediate medical attention, and he's on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about forbidden drugs and the presence of allergies?
Please set these details in writing to be ready.
"It is not only a financial issue but also a doctor's professionalism," Martin adds.
"What medicines are needed?
Who will take care of the dog?
You have to plan everything."
In Ilfracomb a man shot several times with a pneumatic spark
The man got a couple of attacks with a pneumatic spark as he walked home at night.
About 40 years ago, he was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracomb, Devon County, when he was shot in his chest, his life, and his hand.
Police officers described a shooting that took place around 02:30 at local time as an "accident."
The victim did not see the attacker.
His trauma is not a threat to life, the police ask the witness to contact them.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official figures, at least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that swept across the Indonesian city of Palau on Friday, and is expected to be the number of deaths.
Because of the disconnection of the relationship of journalists engaged in humanitarian aid, they could not obtain any information from Dongal's regency, a region north of Paul, which is closer to a 7.5-ball earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Pala, after a stressful disaster.
Here are some key facts about Paul and Dongal on the island of Sulawesi:
Pala is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 people for 2017.
When the earthquake occurred and the tsunamis came, the city celebrated the 40th anniversary of its establishment.
Dongala is a regency that is located over 180 miles (300 km) on the coast of the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
Regency is an administrative unit with status below government, and in 2017, there were 299,200 people.
Fisheries and the rural host are the main economics of Central Slovenia, especially the coastal region of Dongal.
The acquisition of nickel also has an important value for faith, but mostly concentrated in Moravia, on the opposite coast of Slovene.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Reduction, over the last 100 years, Paul and Dongal have suffered a tsunami strike.
In 1938, over 200 people died in the tsunamis in Dongal and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Dongal in 1996, resulting in the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is in a seismic-active Pacific fire ring and its regular rocking of earthquakes.
The following list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: a strong earthquake on the western coast of the Indian Ocean in the north of Sumatra on 26 December called for tsunamis, which swept 14 countries, resulting in the loss of 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in the Ocean.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes turned against the West Coast of Sumatra at the end of March-earth of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Niss, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 occurred south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, calling for tsunamis that turned south, resulting in the deaths of about 700 people.
2009: In the town of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra, a 7.6-ball earthquake occurred.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-ball earthquake took place on one of the Isles of Mentawa outside of Sumatra, calling for tsunamis up to 10 meters, which destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The poor earthquake has turned against the regent of Susie Jay in the Acheh province, calling for destruction and panic, as he reminded people of the desolation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunamis.
This time the tsunamis didn't come, but over 100 people died under the ruins of buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes have turned against the tourist islands of Indonesia Lambok, resulting in more than 500 deaths, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists without being able to leave.
The older son of Sarah Palin was arrested for domestic violence in the family
Trace Pailin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice-candidate of the president of Sara Pailin, was arrested on charges of assault.
29-year-old Pailin from Basil, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, which contradicted the information about domestic violence and the opposition arrest published on Saturday by the Alaskan state police.
According to the police report, when one known person tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he picked up her phone.
According to the KTUU, Pailin is located in the next islander Matanusko-Sustaint under a $500 loan.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he reported to himself "precisely innocent," when he was asked if he would admit his guilt, the network reported.
Pailin's been charged with three Class A violations, which threatens to free him up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He's also indicted for Class B crime, which is punishable by the release of his day-to-day freedom and fines in 2000 dollars.
It's not the first case when the charges against Pailin were brought.
In December 2017, he was charged with assault on his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police to tell her about the alleged attack.
The case is now at the trial of the Alaskan veterans' court.
In November 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, with reporting domestic violence and with the storage of arms in the state of alcohol abuse in connection with the incident.

Earthquakes in Indonesia, tsunamis: hundreds of killed
At least 384 people died as a result of the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Slovenes on Friday.
The earthquake forced 7.5 balls of noise and broke down thousands of houses.
Electricity and networks aren't working, and it's expected that in the next few days, the number of victims will grow.
The earthquake took place not far from central Slovenia, which is located on the north-east of the Jakarta capital of Indonesia.
And social networks are spreading video clips that show a moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palo when the tsunamis came to the shore.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office requires a rare death sentence for a suspected terrorist in New York City.
The New York Federal Public Prosecutor's Office is charged with a death penalty for Saiful Saipov, suspected of being a terrorist in New York, resulting in the death of eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipaw, a 30-year-old man in October, seemed to have taken advantage of the company's home depot truck ride along six West-side in Lower Manhattan, breaking down the pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
In order to justify the death sentence, according to the report of the intention to punish the death penalty that occurred in the South District of New York, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov 's intentionally' killed eight people and 's intentionally' caused serious bodily damage.
According to the court's materials, for both violations, the possible punishment is like a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the major federal jury of Assalamil Saipov's prosecution of 22 counts, which included eight charges in the murder to support the missile; this item is usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of means of transport.
According to the prosecutors, the attack required “old and deliberate planning”, and describing Saipov crimes, they used such phrases as “accursed, harsh and dissipated”.
"Syfula Habibuleevich Saipov caused injuries, caused damage and brought loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Lori Dekadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlie, Erna Ferro, Erna Diego Mendes, and Alejandro Damien Pgnuk," says the statement of intentions.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
Since the last start of a criminal case with a penalty measure like a death penalty in the South of New York has been past ten years.
Respondent Halid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug addicts, but eventually he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
For the last time, the death penalty in New York was applied in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple, who had been sentenced to two years earlier for talking to the Soviet Union for the benefit of the Cold War.
A couple of Rosenberg was sentenced to an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipaw, an exit from Uzbekistan, according to the court documents, demonstrated the absence of conscience violations in the days and months after the attack.
In the words of the police, he made the following statement that he felt satisfaction from his grandson.
According to the prosecutor's imprisonment, Saipov informed the authorities that he was inspired by the video viewer of the Islamic State on the phone.
He also requested permission to hang the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital room, reported to the police.
He doesn't recognize himself as guilty in an adjudicative conclusion, which consists of 22 points.
David Patan, one of the federal public defenders who represents Saipov, said that they were "indisputablely disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, rather than the benefit of imprisonment without the possibility of liberation, is only to prolong the pain of these events for all participants," Patan said.
Saipov's defence command earlier asked the prosecutors not to demand a death penalty.
A member of Parliament from Tora says that Nigel Faraj should mark Brexit's talks.
Today, during a protest at the Tory's conference, Nigel Farage was "mobilizing the national army".
Former Ukip leader said politicians should "sigh discomfort" from Eurosceptics – as one of the members of the Tereza May parliament proposed their candidacy for talks with the EU.
A member of Parliament from Peter Bowe's Conservative Party said during a march in Birmingham that the Great Britain would have "extended" if Mr. Faraz had taken possession of the breakfast on Brexit.
But the problem encountered by Mrs May, trying to imitate her distinguished supporters, was even worse when the Tori, who advocated the preservation of EU membership, made a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain a compatriot checker agreement under constant pressure on the part of the supporters and the workers of the exit, as well as the EU itself.
The allies insist on trying to close the deal with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and want to force the Eurosceptics and the libarians to choose between the package and the "unsatisfied."
Mr. Boone said at a meeting in Salihal's "Leave Means Leave", which he wanted to "remove the Checker from the board".
He suggested that Mr. Faraday do the same and set up duties for talks with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would have gone out," he said.
A member of Parliament from Velingbor added, "I'm for Brexit, but we need to get out of the Czech Plan."
Speaking against the EU, he said: "We do not wage world wars to be dependent.
We want to enforce our own laws in our country."
Mr. Boone rejected the assumption that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their opinion and want to stay is completely out of the question."
Brexit's supporter and Thor, Andrea Jenkins was in March, and in conversation with the journalists, she said, "I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to people.
"The Czech plan is not popular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not popular in our party and activists who actually go out and pick us out.
Please turn down the plan and start listening."
In a sharp turn to Mrs. May, she added, "The prime minister stays on hold when his promises are fulfilled."
Mr. Faraj said that politicians need to "sigh discomfort" when they are going to betray a decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It's a matter of trust between us -- peoples and politicians," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say to them, 'It won't come out of your hands.'"
In return to the crowd he added, "I want you to make those politicians who are willing to betray Brexit feel uncomfortable.
"We mobilize the national army of this country, which has given us victory in Brexit, and we will never be satisfied until we become independent, self-sufficient, proud United Kingdoms."
Meanwhile, the exit officials went through Birmingham before they held a two-hour meeting in the center of town.
Several activists were fanging the Tories Against Brexit (Tori vs. Brexit) banners after the group started in these outputs.
The Liberian Per Lord Adanis had come across the conservators with the opportunity for security issues they faced from the evening programs at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can be ready to use the IT system and all the technology for Canada plus, for the limit without training, for the free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
A thing like a good Brexit. There is no such thing as," he added.
Warren is planning to pay close attention to the President's engagement process.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after she chose November, she "was very careful about the process of talking about the president's seat."
The Boston Globe reports that a democrat from Massachusetts told of his future on Saturday during a general march in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is going to be re-elected, and he is going to be opposed by a member of the Republican Jeff Dzill, who was an aid company for Trump in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the centre of the discussion as the potential enemy of the Trump in 2020.
From the moment the Trump entered the landing, it was already 36th meeting with voters in the form of a general march, which took place on Saturday in Haliyak.
One of the participants asked if she was planning to talk to the president.
Warren replied that the time had come for the woman to go to Washington to correct the corrupt government, and for that to happen, a woman must be in charge."
The arrest took place after the death of the basketball player Sims from Louisiana State University.
The Baton-Russia police, Louisiana's state, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the murder of a basketball player, SHL Wade Sims, was arrested on Friday.
The Baton-Russia Police Department announced the 20-year-old Dietan Simpsan's arrest during a press conference that took place 11 hours in the morning of the East.
On Friday, they published a video of the shooting with a request to help identify the person who was painting on it.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot in the morning of Friday at the campus of the University of South.
"Wayd Sims has had a gunshot wound in his head as a result of his death," said Merfi J. Paul's police chief, a journalist on the 247sports channel on Saturday.
Wade stood up for his friend and was shot by Simpson.
In the course of the investigation, Simpson confessed to what was at the crime scene, was armed and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson did not resist in the arms and was taken under guard in the police corrigendum of the East-Bonton-Russia district.
A sportsman who grew up 6 feet, 6 inches (201 cm) in Baton-Russia grew up, Sams last season played in 32 games, 10 of which were on the square from the beginning, in the middle of the square 17.4% minutes, left 5.6 points and 2.9 teams for the game.
Green At Russia: Lewis Hamilton approached the world champion after gaining victory over Sebastian Fetel
From that moment on, as Walter Bots went on Saturday to compete with Louis Hamilton, it became clear that the instructions contained in the Mercedes command play a significant role in the race.
Bots pulled out a good place on the countess and almost left Hamilton on the will of fate, while he defended his place on the first two mirrors and invited Fetell to attack his friend by command.
The fattened first went to the pit-stop and left Hamilton kneeling at the end of the common crowd of lumberjacks, namely this manoeuvre had to become decisive.
The Mercedes pilot went to the Pittsburgh round and went out behind the Fetel, but Hamilton went out after several round-to-round maneuvers, which forced the driver Ferrari to leave the inner space free, risking being held after the double maneuver to defend himself on the third turn.
Max Ferstopen on his 21st birthday started from the back of a network and was at the end of the first circle in the seventh place.
Then he led most of the race, while holding the dogs; for he wanted to quickly finish, bend Kim Rykanen and take the fourth place.
As a result he went to the pit stop on the 44th round, but couldn't increase speed on the other eight rounds, so Rican took the fourth place.
It was a difficult day, because Walter all the outputs spoke fantastically and expressed himself as a true gentleman if I were allowed to say so.
"The team has done an excellent job to take the first and second places," said Hamilton.
It was a really bad language of the body
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dean Finnstein on a Saturday meeting because she insisted that she was not the source of the escape letter by Christine Blaise Ford, in which she accused the parole officer of Bret Cavan's Supreme Court of Sexual Violence.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not direct his attention to the indications given to Ford before the Senate's judicial committee, but rather commenting that what was happening in the Senate showed how people could be "slow, hateful and unfair".
"The only thing that can happen, and then it's beautiful what's happening in the last few days in the Senate, is that you see anger when you see evil, ugly and false people," he said.
"When you read about press releases and runaways, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diana Finnstein, is that your escape?
Remember her answer... you lost the document - "oh, oh, what?
No, no.
There was nothing from me."
Wait a minute.
We let go... no, we didn't let go," he said, advising the senator.
Einstein sent a letter in July with a detailed statement of the charges brought against Kavana by Ford, and he fled in early September--but Finnstein denied that the escape had taken place from her office.
"I didn't cover Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't let her history run away," said the Finnstein Committee, reporting The Hill.
"She asked for the story to remain confidential and I satisfied her request."
But her refusal probably didn't like the president who so commented on it during the Saturday meeting, "That's what I'm going to tell you, it was a really bad language of the body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it's the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
In continuing the defence of the candidacy in the Supreme Court, accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president suggested that the democrats use the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to return their power by any means.
You see the authority, the measure, and they're the ones they're hurting, and they're going to have to break down to get control and control, and they're going to deliver the president's words, Mediaite.

The airman is sinking, saving hundreds of passengers from the earthquake
An airman in Indonesia, the hero, died ensuring a successful flight of hundreds of passengers on board.
More than 800 people died, and many disappeared after a massive earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which called for tsunamis.
The strong underground thrusts continue, and many people are buried under the clouds in the city of Palau.
Although his colleagues had escaped by escape, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his residence at the high school, which the savage had been climbing at the airport of Paul Mutiara Sis Al Jufri.
He remained in place until the ship of 6321 Batik Air, which was at that moment in the airfield, was off the ground.
Then he jumped out of the high schoolroom when he decided that she was breaking up.
Later he died in the hospital.
According to an Australian ABC News programme, a representative of Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Syreit, said that he may have saved hundreds of lives.
We've been preparing a return trip from Balicapapan to Kalimantan, which had to be carried to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter flew to Paul.
"Our hearts are broken," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities of the countries are concerned that the number of victims can reach several thousand, while the agencies to reduce the danger of stressful disasters claim that access to the city of Dongal, Sigi and Boston is limited.
A representative of Sotopa Purva Nugroho's agency said, "Perhaps the number of victims will still be increased, as many bodies have not yet been able to escape under the clouds."
The waves, which reached up to six meters, devastated Paul, where a mass burial will take place Sunday.
Vulnerable and commercial aircraft are carrying humanitarian aid.
Russ Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, announced "Sky News": "Every minute the car "fast" brings the body.
Pure water does not boil.
They're doing stores everywhere."
Ian Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, reported "CNN": "Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help those who survived, but we don't know what's waiting for them here.
It's already a tragedy, but it can all get much worse."
The president of Indonesia, Jack Ododa, arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the soldiers, "I ask you all to work day and night to complete the evacuation.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
Earlier this year, in Indonesia, she had already suffered from earthquakes in Lamboke, where more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: According to Air Niguini, one man died without information after a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline that made the trip, which made an accident landing in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, had previously claimed that all 47 passengers and teams were lucky to evacuate from the plane that was flying, and now it's about to disappear without the information of one passenger.
Air Niguini's company said in press release that on Saturday's condition it couldn't report the location of one male passenger.
The airline reported that it was working with local authorities, hospitals, and others to find a man.
The airline did not immediately report details about the passenger; for example, his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the rest of the passengers and the crew after the plane was landed on the water when they tried to land at Chowk Island Airport.
On Friday, the official officials informed us that seven people had entered the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday; they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the breach and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
According to both the airline and the U.S. V.S., the plane landed in the lagoon without moving to the residential area.
The message from some witnesses was that the plane jumped into the parking lot.
According to American passenger Bill Janes, the plane flew very low.
"It was very successful," said Janes.
According to his words, he and others were able to walk through the water into the crash exits of the plane, which had already danced.
He said that the shipyards had panicked and began to shout, as well as that he had got a small head injury.
The U.S.A. reports that the sailors, who had arranged the crash of the docks, also helped to rescue by using an inhaled boat to transport people to the shore until the plane sank at a depth of about 100 feet (30 meters).
According to the Air Safety Networks, 111 people died when they violated the aircraft registered in Papua New Guinea in the last 20 years, but none of them belonged to Air Niguini.
Analytical renews the movement of events the night the woman was burned by the animal
On Saturday, the prosecution completed the presentation of evidence in a review of the case of a man accused of burning a resident of the state of Mississippi in 2014.
A United States Ministry of Justice analyst, Paul Roulette, for several hours, gave evidence as an expert involved in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to recognize the move of 29-year-old respondent Quintana Tellis and 19-year-old sacrifice of Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
As The Clarion Ledger reports, according to Roulette, he received information about the place from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers at the evening of her death, which contradicted his previous statement.
If it was reported that his cell phone was near Chambers's phone while, according to his statement, he was with his friend Michael Senford confirmed, the police were directed to ask for Senford.
Leonard gave a statement on Saturday and confirmed that on that day he had not been in the city.
When the defendant's side asked if Tellis was telling the truth about what Sanford was in the van that evening, he said that he was "misleading, as my van was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was Tellis' claim that he was familiar with Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone records showed that they knew each other all week.
According to Roulette, after some time after the death of Chambers Tellis, she deleted her messages, calls and contacts from her phone.
"He stole it from his life," Haley said.
The side of protection must begin the side breaks on Sunday.
According to the judge, it is expected that the case will be referred to the jury later that same day.
The High Breed: What is a known hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio intends to avoid a negative view of this genre, filling his music with stable settings.
The High Breed, a group from Bristol, says that the hip-hop has turned away from its sources: political statements and fanciful questions.
They want to go back to his roots and make the conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as Akala and Lowkey returned to a collection such as The Fugees and Commons, a popularity in Great Britain.
Another blacksmith?!
She from New York goes to court for a "racist" message after a release.
She from New York falls in court for a marriage mate for discriminating dismissal after receiving a random message sent by her mother with a complaint that she is "one more black".
The couple rejects that they are racists, balancing the call to "emergency."
In 2016, the mother of two children, Lucy Plasca-Flexman, expressed disappointment, finding that the new bride, Giselle Moriss, was black when she arrived on her first day of work.
"NEEEEEEEEEE, ANOTHER QUEEN," wrote Mrs. Plaska-Flacksman in her husband's message.
However, instead of sending his husband, she twice sent a message to Miss Morris.
As New York Post reported, understanding the error, the Flashman-insulted Plasca-Flexman fired Ms. Morris, claiming that the previous girl, who was also an African, was ill at work, and that she was waiting for her Filipino instead.
Ms. Morris paid the day's work and sent home to Uber.
Now, Morris is a couple in court, and he wants to get a payout in line with the conditions on which she was first hired, even without contract: $350 a day for six months with a living.
"I want to show them that they can't do that," she said, "Post" on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejected the charges of racism, claiming that the revenge of Morris was a reasonable solution, considering that they could not trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent her what she shouldn't have said.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasko's husband.
"And would you trust your children because they were rude, even by accident?
Your bride?
Is it not?"
The plane evened the call to the "mutuality" and announced that his wife had been born only two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
"And will you be pursuing a man in such a position?
It's pretty hard," added the investment-banking specialist.
Although judicial deliberation is still ongoing, the public opinion quickly condemned the marriage couple in social networks, putting up with harsh criticism of their behaviour and logic.
The publishers of Sugtan warned that readers will not be opposed to the medium that speaks, spoken in a new sheet
Bond's daughter Karen Yangkel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, wrote about the letter: "The difficulty is putting herself in the place of the one who reads it first before it is published.
So interesting it is to read, already knowing of the great success of Podington."
She told her father, who worked for the BBC operator, that he had to write a book for children about a small toe bear, was optimistic despite the fact that his work had not been accepted and added that the 60th edition of the book was "skinny-sweet" after his death last year.
She added that her father quietly was proud of his final success, speaking of Podington, whose description she describes as "a very important member of our family."
"He was quite a quiet man, and quite unexploded," she said.
"But since Podington was so real to him, it was almost a father's honour for a child that was demanded of: thou shalt be proud of them, though in fact it is not thy merit.
I think he's been looking at the success of Podington exactly in such a key.
Although it was his creation, the product of his imagination, he always gave up the right to the subjugation itself."
My daughter died, and I had to deal with her on the phone
After her daughter had been delivered to Nica Louis Pastera's hospital 2, where the doctors struggled hard for her life.
"Now she phoned regularly to tell me that it was really bad that she didn't survive," said Mrs. Eden-Laperuz.
"Then I called Nad to say that she was dying for the next two minutes, and I had to develop with her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tash, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The doctors, who had given to beat her heart, slowly left her body.
She died a while ago, and it was the end.
I just had to sit there, knowing that it was all unfolded there.
I could neither groan nor cry nor weep, for there were family and people around me.
I had to hold on."
At last, Mrs. Eden-Laperuz, who had survived the loss of her daughter, took a seat on the plane with other passengers -- and they didn't know exactly what she had to go through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I bowed my head and on my face all the time flowed with tears.
It's hard to explain, but it was in the field that a feeling of compassion for Ned caught me.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how he loved her."
Women who are sad enough to draw cards to avoid being killed on a bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones who ended up killing themselves do everything they can to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey draw cards with warm words and phone numbers that people can get help on the bridge in Wales.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when his depression began, and at the age of 18, he ended his life by suicide.
"I don't want other parents to feel like I do," she said.
45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Lidney, said her son was a talented boss with a contagious smile.
"The old man knew his smile.
People said that his smile would illuminate any room."
However, before he died, he quit his job because he was “in a very dark place”.
In 2014, Brother Tyler, then 11, found his brother’s body when he died of suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly worried that this could be an unpleasant outcome."
Mrs. Davis created a map, "that people would know that there are people in the world who you can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay quiet, you need to talk."
Mrs. Hasfres, who has been dating Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her partner, with whom she had lived for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say that he was sad, or that he was depressed, or something like that," she said.
"For a few days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
On the festive day he was very depressed: when the children opened gifts, he did not even look at them."
She said that his death was a major injury to them, but she had to live with it: "In the family there was a huge hole.
It's just killing us.
But you have to keep on living and fighting."

Future Brett Cavan is uncertain, as the FBI is beginning to investigate
"I thought we could have what he wanted – limited in time and in the field of research – we could get a bit of unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the committee was "dissolved" because of what actually happened in the sample.
Why doesn't Mr. Kawano and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct a investigation?
Their unwantedness is sometimes explained.
The interim elections in five weeks, November 6th -- if the Republics are expected to suffer at once, then they will be weakened in their attempts to choose the highest court that they need.
George Bush called the senator to discuss Mr. Cavano's support, who worked in the White House during the Bush presidency and through him met his wife Ashley, who then worked as a personal secretary for Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
Until she realized if Mr. Kavano would get at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Vice President Mike Pens to solve the problem of the equality of voices and to confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean winners has fallen under Kima's leadership
The number of North Korean refugees in South fell since Kim Chen's government came seven years ago, a South Korean official said.
Bo Sun, bringing data from the South Korean Ministry on the merger, said last year there were 1127 winners, and in 2011 2706.
Mr. Park stated that the main reasons are the strengthened border control between North Korea and China and the higher costs that had been incurred by the smugglers for the reconstruction.
Phen'an had no comment on it.
Most of the winners from the north with what they get the citizens of South Korea.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Korean residents illegally crossed the border after the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most of them run across China, with the longest in North Korea. It's easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is highly protected.
China views refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees and often forced to report them.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is technically still in the war, has improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenyan to talk about denuclearization.
This happened after the historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Inn in June in Singapore when they agreed in general terms for the purpose of fully releasing the Korean nuclear weapon.
But on Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, Yan Ho, accused American sanctions in the absence of progress since that time.
"Without trust to the United States there will be no certainty in our national security, and under such conditions we will not be going to disarm the first," said Mr. Riya in a speech at the AAN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelozy called Brett Cavano "Isterical," she says he shouldn't work in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosy called a candidate at the Bret Cavana Výrhov Court and said that in his temper he did not fit for work in the Výrhovov court.
Pelosi said this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't get rid of the thought that if a woman had done this to herself, she would be called an "esteric," said Pelozi about her reaction to the talk of the Kawano before the Senate's Legal Committee on Thursday.
They were emotionally charged with sexual harassment to Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were still teenagers.
During his opening speech, Cavano was very emotional, sometimes even shouting and couldn't talk when his family and the older classes were discussing.
He also strongly accused the democrats in the committee, calling charges against his "gratcal and organised killings", organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential election in 2016.
The panel stated that it believed that the Cavano speech showed that he could not work in the Fire Court, because it clearly showed that he had the advantage of being against the democrats.
"I think he has discredited himself with his statements and the manner in which he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Fields prevented her when she was asked if she would try to impress the Caveno when she was chosen and when the Democrats got most of the House of Representatives.
“I will say so – if he does not speak the truth in Congress or in the FBI, he should not only work in the Religious Court, but also in the court where he works now,” said Pelozy.
At this point, Kawano is the judge of the District Court of Appeal of the District of Colombia.
Palozy added that as a member of the Democratic Party, she was concerned about the potential solutions of the Cavano against the law on available medicine or the Raw case against Wade, because Cavano was considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing of the statement on the testimony of the Cavan did not answer the questions, whether he would cancel certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time for aesthetic, non-objective persons to work in court and expect us to say, 'How wonderful,'" said Palozy.
And a woman must bear it.
It's a legitimate criminal speech, months and years of anger just melt, and she can't remember it without tears.
"We cry when we're angry." 45 years ago, Mrs. Stone told me.
"I don't think it's such a rare thing."
She went on to say, "I had a lot of help from a woman who worked for the director, and who said that when she got caught, she was crying, but she was working on a technique of behavior, and when she got caught up and started to cry, the interviewers said, "You might think I'm sorry, because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And I just kept talking.
I think it was great."
The tears are allowed partly as an exit of the sum, because they are absolutely misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories of the first work that I once cried out of unexplained anger, then I was caught by an elderly woman--a prisoner chief who always made me a little frightened--and pulled me up on the stairs.
"Never let them see you in tears," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think that you are sad and will be glad that has given you."
Patriot Schroeder, at the time the British-Democrat from the state of Calarad, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential company.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt got married on a train called Monkey Business and got out of the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder's very angry thought that she could also participate in the presidential campaign.
"It wasn't a very well thought-out solution," she laughed and said 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, and I was totally unnecessary.
Someone called this "Bellow and Seven Dwarves."
Since the company had been running for quite a while, she didn't have the resources, so she said she wouldn't take part in the election unless she took $2 million.
It was a bad situation.
It turns out that some of her supporters who sacrificed $1,000 to men gave her just $250.
"They think I'm going with a discount?" she thought.
When she made a statement that she was not going to participate in the election, she was so deeply touched by the emotions – thanks to the people who supported her, the system's evils that made it so difficult to get money and directed to the electors rather than to the candidates, and the anger of sexism – which took over the breathing.
"You might think I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Shrodard's reaction to the press on her condition.
"It was possible to think that my corporate sponsor was the producer of Kleenex paper.
Have I ever thought they'd write on my supermotive stone?
"She cried?"
Why a trade war between China and the United States can be good for Beijing
The first wave of trade war between China and the United States was overwhelming, and since war is far from over, in the longer prospect of misunderstandings between countries can be for the benefit of Beijing, experts say.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, shot the first warning at the beginning of this year, taxing China's main export companies, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation took place this week, when the new tariffs dropped the total amount of $200 billion (150 billion pounds), actually taxing half of the goods that occur in the United States of America from China.
Each time Beijing responded in the same way, rising recently from five to ten percent of the US ship's cost of $60 billion.
China's fans of the United States' symmetrical response, and the second, by the size of the economy, will hardly cause eye contact.
To force Washington to resign, we have to step into demand, but the public tendency towards the United States is practically unacceptable for China's leader, Si Xinpin.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of the situation, the U.S. war pressure in a distant perspective can support China by reducing the interdependence of these two countries.
"The fact that a rapid political solution in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will start a severe economic downturn, much more dangerous than observers have thought before," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant specializing in Asia, in the research-analytical centre of new American security.
Syrian 'prepared' to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
The Syrian states that he is ready to return to the refugees and calls for assistance in the recovery of a war-damaged country that has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the AAN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and secure, thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renew areas that have been demolished by terrorists to return to normal life.
Now we have all the conditions for returning refugees to the country that they were forced to leave because of terrorism and guided economic measures that were directed towards improving their daily lives and means of living.
AAN believes more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem stated that the Syrian regime would gladly receive help to rebuild the ruined country.
However, he stressed that the country would not receive help in exchange for certain conditions or assistance from the countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe has won the Cup of Rider in Paris
The European team won Cuba Rider in 2018, winning the US team with a final number of 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National field in the province of Paris, France.
The U.S. has already played a six-fold stand on European soil and has not won the Rider Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe has won the crown even though the Dutch captain Thomas B'ern's command took 14.5 points to win over the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who fought most of all at the tournaments, threw his ball into the water for 3 pairs of 16th-holes, setting up this match of French Malinarians.
The Italian golfer Malinari played excellently on all rounds, making one of the four players who passed this field with the number 5-0-0 from the beginning of the tournament in the current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Schree was defeated by 5 and 4 players with the lowest rating in the European team, Thornborn Olsen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's most powerful player, lost 2 and 1 Ien powderer from England, who was probably playing in his last cup of Raider.
A veteran with eight cubes of Rider Spanish Serhia Garcia has become a player who has won more than anyone in a tournament with a career of 25.5 points.
"Normally I don't cry, but I can't stop today.
It was a hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas, who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad to return the cube.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad it could help,' said the disturbed Garcia after the European team won.
He passed on to his countryman John Ram, who had lost the legend of American golfer Tiger Woods on Sunday in a single match of 2&1.
"I'm very proud of what I won in Tiger Woods, the man who's been out of his childhood career," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four mothers in France and now my record number is 13-21-3 in Ryder's cube.
An amazing statistician of one of the greatest players of all time who won 14 main titles and stays on this indicator only from Jack Niklaus.
The American team fought with each other except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tney Finns, who played the entire high-school golf tournament.
American Captain Jim Fury said after a desperate game in defense of his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they're guys.
This morning we showed Europe what we could do.
We fought.
Let's take off our hats in honor of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the U.S. Golf Association and our Ryder's Cube Committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Take the hat off before them.
We've been moved."
