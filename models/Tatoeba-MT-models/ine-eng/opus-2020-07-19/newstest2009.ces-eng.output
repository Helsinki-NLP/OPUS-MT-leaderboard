The Prague Stock Exchange went down to the end of the trade
After the early collapse, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected the losses.
Transactions with CEZ shares have reached almost half of the ordinary daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange has been binding immediately since the beginning of Tuesday's trade on its Monday break when it has dropped by almost six percent.
This time, there's a drop in action on Wall Street.
This is how we see the response of the market to the result of the vote of the US House of Representatives, who refused to support the plan for the stabilisation of the dark financial sector.
Action floor in Asia
The dramatic fall in Tuesday experienced stockpiles in Asia, even though the indexes lost some of them eventually during the course of the day.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng stock exchange rate dropped almost four percent, but later part of the loss decreased and reduced to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which is monitoring the movement of Chinese stock exchanges in Hong Kong, dropped by 3.8%, and the markets were closed in Shanghai.
The stock exchange in Sydney lost more than five percent, but ultimately lost to 4.3 percent.
The exchange rate in Taiwan, according to the dark index, decreased by 3.6 percent.
"The timing of a rescue action in the United States is indiscriminate and affects the financial markets around the world," noted the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy on its own, thus independent of the Chinese central bank.
Hong Kong is at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudda, US legislators should quickly return to the negotiations and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, he threatens that the effects will be felt by other countries.
Bloody pool of American shares
On Monday, the US Swedish representatives rejected the financial system's support plan, to which up to $700 billion (approximately 12 billion CZK).
Lawmakers so ignored President George Bush's challenge to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the underlying causes of the financial crisis and would help stabilise the entire economy.
The American shares experienced a blood spa on Monday and the main action indices recorded the largest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by nearly seven percent and a similar decline was observed last year in 1987.
The index was already down before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal was not passed in the locker room, the index fell off in a free fall.
Congress set up: The US government can pump 700 billion dollars to the bank
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed in a broader form of an agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
We'll vote for him at the beginning of next week.
The US legislators have made a breakthrough in the negotiations on the adoption of the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the US financial system amounting to $700 billion (approximately 12 billion crowns).
But it's not won yet.
Congressmen must complete certain details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on the basis of the Charter of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, Agent Reuters told the Banking and Financial Services Committee of Barney Frank.
According to the sources, the Senate may vote on the plan first on Wednesday.
Economies believe that the adoption of the rescue plan should be the first major psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
But then it comes to "cutting" thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms that help markets to achieve themselves in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have resolved our different views on how to look like a package to stabilise the market," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still come on Sunday.
Lawmakers' representatives met with the US Finance Minister Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give a final form to the government fund.
It should buy from financial companies non-selling mortgage assets that bring financial companies into serious losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are in the final agreement of the plan, which will work and must also be effective on the market.
It's important to continue in the recovery plan, but I think we're there," said Paulson.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the stock markets, which are falling rapidly.
According to Nevad democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawyers are trying to reach a final agreement at Congress on Sunday.
They therefore want to calm investors before trading in the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where the Congress' decision could affect Monday's trading.
However, it is not yet clear with certainty when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, or whether they can't tie the proceedings for the last moment to some problem.
Lawmakers hope he'll be approved in the next few days.
But the law still knows a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system is to be divided into two parts.
Initial $350 billion should be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amounts if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, followed by another $100 billion and later final $350 billion.
Bush assessed progress in the negotiations
The President may vote in favour of this decision, but Congress may vote in favour of his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme, which was to obtain funding for the redemption of bad mortgage securities, whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, has been preserved.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President Bush is pleased with the progress he has made in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Bush is satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciates "the mutual effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitations of gold falls
The chairman of the Banking Committee of Senator Christopher Dodd, the leader of the negotiator, said that the legislators agreed on responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers from loss, closure of the benefits, the timing of financing the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit so-called gold tax for the directors of the participating companies and to establish a committee to oversee the fund.
He should run the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it and we have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also counts with the help of home owners who have problems with paying.
The government should negotiate new rents on mortgages that it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly cost of payments for debtors and allowing them to leave their homes.
Mark: Psychological assistance
According to the Chief Economist Patria Finance David Mark, the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to realize.
"And that's because you don't know what the mechanism and what price the problem assets will buy.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government will share their losses," said Marek for the iHNed.cz server this week.
If the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week, it is not so important according to Mark.
"It is far more important that the congressmen agree this week that they support this plan and that it will be dedicated as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement on approval is now the most important," Marek stressed.
Fight against sharp knives: MP3 players against mobile phones.
We'll figure out how to choose
While almost every cell can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
That makes it clear that it's better to buy just a phone.
Yet, there are plenty of reasons to order a single player.
The choice depends entirely on the way in which the future owner uses and claims.
You'll probably find it hard to set up a top expensive gramophone at home to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc album.
However, such music products on the LP desk do not come from a qualitative point of view and there is no objective reason to do so.
However, if you pressured yourself into wine in your regalia with art rock, jazz or blues, you probably dream of such a gramophone at least.
It's the same with music on the roads, so music compressed, simplified - music in MP3.
There are also price and qualitative categories.
For someone it may be unacceptable to lose a player eight thousand crowns, as well as a fan of Pink Floyd, it may be difficult to test the audience for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremities between which there is enough room for each.
The choice is wide.
Decides to maintain the battery
Some top music players can do much more than just play music, but what most mobiles do not happen.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to primary functions, telephoneing and examsing, he can play music and video, both of them record, he has better, worse camera and he can also navigate.
And if we take the smartphone and the comms, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and no TV can take pictures.
The universality of the cell also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the sooner the indicator will send you on the display to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy gaps.
A tiny cell can play music for up to ten hours, most of it is much less.
In this direction, the music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more efficient.
For cheap phones, count with the fact that you won't be playing for more than a few hours.
If you're still here and you're calling, go to work for security and get another charger - it's also for expensive devices.
In MP3 players, you will not have this problem, and the worst will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on one charge.
Another problem arises when recording music in the cell.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices have a universal USB connector, and not all of them can be directly connected to a computer without a special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on a memory card, but only a multiple reader card will be able to deal with the miniature memory cards that are used in mobiles without any reduction.
You don't need any special software for players except (iPod).
It's just a device to fill your music with USB from your computer.
Most mobile and players are already creating their own music library based on the name of the interpreter, the name of the album, the genre or the need to evaluate the user.
Some devices only display tree structure of folders like the Windows Explorer and some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with the operating system).
Players are serving, mobiles are more skilled
When choosing a specific device, take special care with regard to the maintenance of the battery, memory capacity, quality and sound output type, and, of course, to the comfort of control.
If you have music above all and if you listen to it every day just briefly in the tramway, you will have enough of any cell phone that beats MP3.
Which he can actually do almost any cell phone.
You don't even have to watch too much the music formats of your cell phone or player.
MP3 will take over all and an absolute majority of the music that will reach you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widespread and apart from it the simple majority of devices will also manage music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobiles also allow for for example buying online music.
It is enough to visit the operator's relevant website (other than the provider) and purchase a song or album.
This service could already be a fall-back argument for the use of a musical cell.
Unfortunately, the operator's offer is a miserable one, and it limits most of it to the speedy hit radio.
Prices aren't the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether through GSM, internet or wireless internet) is the future of the music industry.
Most people are still wearing a cell phone.
Whenever you get a taste of listening to something, you put your cell phone in your pocket while the MP3 player is lying in the forgotten home.
However, it still matters whether you are wearing a earring or at least a wired handfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has almost every mobile but only a minimum MP3 player.
It'll probably be the biggest advantage of the music cell for a lot of price.
The cheapest is usually under three thousand.
In three and four thousand crowns, you'll already have a very decent walkman.
Most of you, however, will limit the absence of a normal listener.
The best and the most equipped phones on the technical page, even with a 3.5 mm hole for the ordinary listener, are up to 15 thousand.
The advantages of players are, among other things, easy service.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our choice) - players can really control everyone.
The minimum function, the similarity of control with a previously common cassette, or a gramophone is obvious.
There is no risk of collisions in the form of a faulty mobile Internet and subsequently a comprehensive data transfer account.
Which device to download
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) have a fair slot on exchange card (type M2, microSD etc.).
And by buying the card, you'll go into two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
For basic models only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the dearest ones can deal with 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and you want to buy a cheap MP3 player, download Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to lose more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding audiences, you would prefer to contact specialized mobiles - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokie and Samsung).
These devices have a single control button for MP3 and the comfort of the service is so close to a single MP3 player.
Next, it is in Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles from the series walkman have identical user interfaces as a sold-in MP3 player.
The same service and in the same price category to four thousand crowns, but with higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and supports the battery (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), will take you MP3 players from the above marks.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively successful and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, we're missing something here - a virtual operator that would make the classics live.
Maybe it won't be long.
The fact that the Czech operators belong to even the most expensive in Europe, we have written on Mobil.cz many times.
He also confirmed the fact that the price of SMS is higher in us than in the rest of the Union.
Following the last steps of the European Commission on the regulation of roaming charges, a paradox might arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are kept so high compared to Europe?
The answer is a simple lack of competition that really wants to get into the fight.
Maybe it sounds paradoxic, but we have three mobile networks and a penetration of over 100 percent.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to win that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
They are often drawn to this by the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (CTU), Pavel Dvořák, who said several times in the past that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that the classic operator with its own network has no more chances (at least he would already be hard to search for frequency).
But there is another option - virtual operator.
The direct entry of virtual operators into the mobile market brought a significant price reduction, which then had to be reacted to by classical operators.
However, before the entry of a song like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, there were similar voices in the United Kingdom as we do.
But it turns out that the place for such operators is and they can really be successful.
We still don't have to go too far for examples.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator managed to get more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
At the same time, the Penta financial group is behind Mobilking, which in the Czech Republic owns, inter alia, U:Fonna.
The benefits of virtual operators are the opportunity to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, they have a lot less customers than a classic operator.
They do not bear relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, such virtual operators usually profile themselves as low-contributions - offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often offset by a more expensive offer of services.
Thus, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a pretty good move and bet on an indestructible target group.
This operator is specifically targeting men.
"The governing guys choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It's hard to say if a concept like Poland could catch us.
He questioned Vodafon's press speaker Miroslav Čepíký: "The Czech market is relatively small for segmental access, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the offer of services, it is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic without a chance, mobile operators say
But it seems almost certain that if there's a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it won't be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but negotiations in the Czech Republic do not seem too hopeful.
Mobilking is more likely to be released in other countries of our region," said Jana Studničková in a telephone conversation with the Penta financial group.
She has just confirmed that the current mobile operators in Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
Rather, he is trying to do everything in his power to prevent any potential competitor from coming up.
The GTS Novera Group has been absent for a long time in the interest of launching a virtual mobile operator, which would like to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of the O2 Telephony in the field of corporate customers.
"We are very interested in offering our customers not only strong, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly dealt with these options with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have already managed to proceed in the negotiations," says the press spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe it's getting brighter at a better time.
Unofficial information suggests that we should wait for the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
For the time being, however, his creation is carried out by an impenetrable castle of silence.
"At this point, we do not assume that there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a fully-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
So far, no entity has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sršeně, from the O2 Press Committee, stated in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators shall also be referred to the specificity of the Czech market.
The T-Mobile speaker Martin Kemrová delivers in a rare way the O2 statement: "We have therefore not recorded any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which it would be possible to build further."
And he adds, "In the T-Mobile network, it's hard to find a virtual operator by the end of the year.
At this point, we should already have a specific agreement on the table so that it can be considered in this short horizon."
Vodafone is abdicating its attention rather to meet the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepsky says: "We are open to dealing with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
We consider this to be the most enjoyable from the customers' point of view.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The process of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a decrease in prices and thus a decrease in their profits.
Why, then, should we make it easier for such a competitor?
The fact that when things go down to the operators, they're gonna bring in a rope, a witness, and a Tahanica around the U:Fon.
Probably the biggest pressure towards CTU went in the time of the formation of the U:phone from T-Mobile.
It shall bear witness to this publicly available information from the CHTU website.
Now, however, the U:Fon is the argument why not allow a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová put it this way: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been strengthened by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player to him and, above all, his services would be subject to high requirements."
However, in view of this approach by mobile operators, the interests of the Czech regulatory authorities are directly insinuating.
However, it is not only about the position of CTU, which unfortunately was in the Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other advanced countries - that has no power to engage in economic competition.
They are exclusively owned by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
But he took his typical position to the whole problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible after the agreement between a mobile operator and a virtual operator on the rental of the necessary infrastructure would have been concluded.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not interesting enough for classical operators," said Kristian Chalupa of the Committee on External Relations in answer to our question.
The representatives of the operators may not be surprised by the wording of the statement.
From the authority which is to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses his position on the market, it is more than a matter of concern.
Especially when Kristian Chalupa adds: "In the foreign country, where virtual operators usually act, we can see that their market entry has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephone services."
The pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment, however, is not likely to be part of the interest of UOHS.
In fact, the shock of the whole case is the emotional conjugation of three mobile operators that stem from their reactions.
The question is, if it's really just an accident, it's offered on its own.
The same as the exact same price of petrol at pump stations is certainly only due to the accident and the hard competition struggle.
"The Authority has not looked for signs of an anti-competition procedure in this matter, and therefore there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, so they do not have a corresponding increased responsibility for their conduct on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market for virtual operators are likely to meet also the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the CTU, whereby telecommunications from the point of view of competition is the single market.
Then, of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position in such a market.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - the creation of a virtual operator always requires the consent of network operators.
And a mobile operator -- he's got a whole logic -- on his own network, monopoly.
So in a certain segment, it must be dominant.
However, even if we did not accept this argument, it should be minimal for the OHHS to warn that three mobile operators are acting in a similar manner.
However, the complaints from a number of stakeholders (including GTS Novera) indicate that all operators are in a position to take a very similar approach.
The validation of responsibility for ČTÚ is then in telecommunications a relatively common trick that ÚOHS gives away from the whole matter of hand.
We've met with him in a number of similar cases.
Unfortunately, to the recent developments in the telecommunications law, the extension of the CTU's powers to competition in telecommunications has not been possible, although a number of experts have since promised to improve the situation.
This must be known more than good by the UOHS representatives, but it's probably their interests elsewhere.
That's what happens when no one looks.
However, there is no mention of the functioning of any pseudovirtual operators that exist in Czech mobile networks right now.
They are companies that issue their own mobile phone service prices, which are only partially public.
It's usually about companies that deal with multi-level marketing.
Own mobile phone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others.
The pricers of these companies usually only get to the chosen ones.
Kuzlo is based on the fact that the company presents the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a significant customer, then, he will receive special prices (and other) offers.
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar sales.
"If there were cases you are talking about, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would deal with and could end cooperation with the company," answered Martin Kemr's question.
However, it is unlikely that a similar activity would not be carried out to responsible people from mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, thousands of customers may be involved.
None of the operators shall, however, refrain from such a procedure.
These companies have indisputable profits and, unlike actual virtual operators, they are at no risk of their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepýk points out the potential problems: "The law of similar speculation enables, but the services of these companies use only a negligible percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not guided by their name, so they cannot be fully available as normal mobile operators."
But it should be at least weird.
In addition, another question for ÚOHS is opened.
If mobile operators turn their eyes over a similar process, why block the creation of a virtual operator?
It must be added that ÚOHS has relatively strong powers to detect similar activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the operator's explanation that they have no such idea and that their business conditions prohibit it.
When we won't be the dearest
As in the text several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market brought a significant drop in prices for services.
At that time, virtually all the countries where virtual operators came up were trying to protect their classical operators from their creations more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - too small, possibly too saturated market, problems with quality of services etc.
In developed countries, but in these moments, regulatory authorities have been involved, which have not lost interest in mobile operators, but their customers.
Whether by formal measures or by informal pressure, the first virtual operator was created and the next one was packed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are pushing the whole case like a hot potato.
From our experience, we can't get rid of the notion that incompetence in these cases they are more than fit.
But let's not put flint in the grass.
If the background information is correct and the virtual operator really appears to us soon, the Czech mobile market may be shifting again.
If one of the operators has created a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult to keep the power of the UOHS to refuse (discrimination) other stakeholders.
And we need to stop calling the rail than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymna has four new versions.
Select the best
Listen to the four implementations of the new version of the Czech State Hymna.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, on the occasion of the Czech State's Day, presented the new recordings of state hymns where my home.
Hymnu again recorded the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávka.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in the congregational presentation and instrumental phrase.
The song was sung by Katerina Kniežink and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the gymnastics adjustments are Otakar Jeremiaš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
Whitehead regards Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymen.
He had already told the Czech public that he had deliberately chosen to sing the salt variants of the singer with young representative voices, which are prominent and popular.
"From the beginning, I was at both and then with the congregation trying to keep them clear so that they could understand the text well, so that they could judge," he said.
The Czech State hymna will celebrate 175th anniversary next year.
The song where my home sounded first in 1834 on the tracks of the Stavovska Theatre in the original Czech game Fidlovac Josef Kajetán Tila complemented by the music Františko Škroupa.
She gained popularity, and people took her for their own.
The first composition of the song then became a natural part of the State Hymna after the birth of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the creation of a separate Czech Republic.
How's "new" the hymna?
Prague MDD in the middle of the first link and on the chip
Wednesday, 1 October 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers will be taken to the metro, tram and buses, which will have a copy in the pocket.
At this point, he can arrange about a hundred thousand people who own an Opencard chip card.
Travelers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and annual coupon (then will be paid since 1 January 2009) and at the same time allow to record on their chip map in the info centres and workshops of the Transport Company in the stations of the Museum, Můstek, Nádraží Holesovice, Angel, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zrad, Kačerov and Luka.
Coupons can also be purchased from yesterday via the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
Service in the afternoon was used by more than four hundred customers.
Those who start using the Internet can definitely forget about the publishing window in the subway stations, where they had to be regularly on long fronts on paper trucks.
The coupon will be purchased via the internet and on the Opencard card will be recorded in one of the thirteen districts of the City Library.
"In these places there is a passenger transfer with a trained service that will help interested people with online shopping and also record a coupon bought on their card," said the speaker project Martin Opatrny.
In addition to the books, it will be possible to record electronic purchases on Opencard also in self-service machines that are mounted in several news stations.
What do the machines look like?
They are red, they remind the riders of the caravans and the travelers may have already noticed them at the stations of Roztyly, Budjejovicá, I. P. Pavlov, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now they are in the city five, but by the end of the year they should be eighty," the Watchman added.
The coupon controls the location of the automatic driver
The machine service that starts working tomorrow is simple.
Just insert the Opencard chip card into them and the first paid coupon will be recorded on it itself.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow are paid not only in the main city, but also in its surroundings.
This means that in the suburban trains and bus lines of 300 to 499, which are driven to the capital, mainly the inhabitants of the medieval towns.
"In the trains included in the Prague Integrated Transport, the guides are equipped with cart readers to determine the time and frequency of coupons," explained the driver Philip Drápal of Ropid, who prepares the train lines of Prague's collective transport.
Domestic buses have read cards built in store at the driver's office.
In the event of a show, it is necessary to show the driver not only the chip card, but also to add the Opencard to the designated place on the side of the treasure.
The driver shall check the validity of the recorded coupons.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the paid coupons, it is nothing easier than to ask the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not go by bus and will not remember when their coupon expires can return to self-serving machines where the coupons are recorded on the card.
Here they will see information about the validity of their documents on the display.
The judges wanted the US referendum.
In 1945, the Germans applied for the inclusion of Forests in the United States.
It comes from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South American scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the auspices of the United States.
With such a wish, some groups of Germans allegedly turned to the president of the United States in 1945.
It follows, among other things, from a letter that was kept in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the University of Jihočes.
In a letter from the Czech Krumlov, the Germans ask the US President not to allow the return of the "Shumb County" - banned by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we want to be sure of the words that the American units come into German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," it is written in a letter, signed by the word "People who lie in the judgment of the Forest on the heart."
Because the accession to Czechoslovakia is allegedly giving the Soviet Germans - with the knowledge of the Czech national character - hope only of brutality, ignorance, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the US President's letter asking him to take over the protection for the present and the present times.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would admit this territory to us a foreign country that oppresses and expels minorities and destroys, without contributing to the victory of the Unions," it says in a letter.
The reason why authors can't sign is apparently concern about the vengefulness of "Czech pushers".
If the President of the United States allegedly doubted the opinion of the forest Germans, it was enough to hold a referendum in the forest parish on whether its inhabitants wanted to become part of the United States or live under the auspices of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today’s knowledge of war history, some scholars suggest that it is appropriate to conclude that the Germans were then expecting the Germans.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least be aware that they were going to be removed from the Republic, only a few of them allowed themselves such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate with the Sudettes some kind of autonomy.
The others believed they'd just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in the Czech Budjejovici.
The one for the war as a Buddhist German was dedicated to the Baltic Navy.
When he was arrested by the British at the end of the war and placed in a detention camp in Holštínsk, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach the Czechs.
"They believed that when they returned home, they would have the Czech toss," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners living before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, were to be removed from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
You don't think - you'll pay!
Emotional Campaign Attacks Drivers
The most expensive action focused on road safety in Czech history.
It would also be possible to characterize the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleše Ribíčka's office promises to take the driver off the dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, movies, the Internet, but also on flights.
She's supposed to get the driver out of the fast ride and the alcohol behind the wheel.
And remind them to join them before they leave.
He wants to reach out to young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what happens at the meetings?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And the "blood" slogan of the whole campaign also bears witness to this:
You don't think - you'll pay!
The word "don't mean" is written in large letters on the expatriate.
But in the blood bag, the word "you'll pay."
This is to symbolize that a person can pay for his own life in a moment of neglect.
The audience will be "fearing" until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of the victims of the accident can normally be seen.
She promises to reduce the accident and the number of dead on the Czech roads.
Spots have been prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and bull on the driver
"The driver pays for the sugar system and the bull.
Sugar for them is that if they go to red, for example, they save time.
The bull is a threat of torment or accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says transport psychologist at the hospital at Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that's why there's a need for an information campaign in the press and mostly negative advertising, my psychologist.
They are already less effective according to the table that alerts the drivers to danger.
"If a static table warning against danger is installed, it will probably soon be in contact with the environment and drivers will not be committed to it," said Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in return for peace
The President of the temporary Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, spoke for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, that is, pre-Jordan, East Jerusalem and Golan, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in a conversation that was published on Monday by Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that almost all (occupied) territories will have to be returned, unless at all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We'll have a certain percentage of these territories, but we'll have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (the Israeli territory), because without that, there will be no peace," he added.
He assumed that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and especially does not want tractors or bulldozers to cross his legs, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in an attack on two July attacks in a city where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mountain, sacred and historic places", which lies within the Old Town.
"The one who wants to maintain Israel's sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
It won't work," he went on.
Departure from the Golan Highs
Olmert also spoke of Israel’s departure from the Golan Highs, which he considered to be an unimaginable condition for the conclusion of the peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort on the part of the Lady.
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria only on the basis of departure from Golan," he pointed out.
"The Syrians well know what they will have to give up to get the Golans.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with (the Shiite Movement) Hizballah; they will have to give up the ongoing support provided by terrorism (the Shiite Movement) to Hamas, (the terrorist network) Al-Qaeda and jihad (the Holy Wars) in Iraq," the Prime Minister explained.
Questions after the accident: Are Stevards on the bus illegal?
The law is unknown, walking on a remote bus must not
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question arises as to whether stewards and passengers can move on the bus.
"If we want to strictly and formally abide by the law, the work of the steward is contrary to the road traffic law," says the spokesperson of the Transport Ministry Karel Hanzelka.
The accident that killed a two-and-a-half-year-old driver last week apparently caused the truck driver who crossed the road.
The girl was sitting next to the driver at the safest place in the car, although she has two more seats.
But the bus can crash, or rush fast, even at a time when Steve spreads coffee or newspaper.
The role is whether the bus is equipped with parking space according to the technical link.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
Remote buses Student Agencies do not have parking places; which Currently.cz also confirmed Radim Janchura's director.
"We have dealt with this with the ministry, and the movement of passengers was not allowed at first.
We then withdrew it and we came to the conclusion that passengers can go for a ride to the bathroom if they have their seat," he said.
The Steward Act doesn't know.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward - no legal provisions do not solve this role.
However, no legislation prohibits carriers from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of the driving vehicle; its rights and obligations are not defined," says Hanzelka.
On the contrary, the Director of the Road Traffic Management Committee of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Korný, believes that the problem of the law is being dealt with sufficiently.
"It depends whether the bus in the approval has a parking space allowed.
That ends it," he says.
Buses are divided into urban areas where there are parking spaces and the maximum speed limit, inter-urban with parking spaces with higher permitted speeds and remote without parking spaces with maximum permitted speeds and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, says the expert
The expert BESIP on transport safety Jaroslav Horín in the move of the stewards on the bus deck does not see the main problem.
"When driving a lot of danger is in danger, the situation can be compared to service in the aircraft.
It's not even safe here when turbulence comes and the plane can hit its head."
"However, if the bus would rush fast, of course physical laws apply.
Just like the city bus or tram.
The safety of the stewards must be addressed by internal regulations," he says, and he also says, in the light of the law, the problem is unresolved.
Janchura is willing to cancel the service
Student Agency offers the service of stewards as the only bus carrier.
He employs two hundred of them.
The Director does not even consider their credentials to be a risk.
"But as soon as I realize that the call from the stewards is risky, I will cancel it.
Coffee and newspapers can get passengers on the way.
It would save the costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the absence of stewards in their vehicles was justified by the director of Asiany Alexei Litvin, who operates a break of lines compared to SA.
"We don't have a stewardess, we've been standing against it from the beginning.
sooner or later, it will end with some fatal injury," he said a year ago for Week.cz.
An Unbearable Tragedy Becomes a Tragedy
In the case of a link connection to Naples, a young steward from Plzeňska died, who worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck is likely to turn off without using the distance direction and block the bus route.
His driver was trying to avoid a rough maneuver, but he was wrong about the right front part.
That it would be sold out two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards, Janchura refuses.
"This place can't be booked by remote connections, they're blocked."
The company is going to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's execution, but the financial compensation is also expected of the guilty party.
The law's amendment?
Non-respective
A clarification of the movement of stewards on the bus board could lead to an amendment of the law to which a 30-year expert group of the Ministry of Transport operates over the year.
"There was no specific conclusion, however.
Buses don't even solve too much, rather point system, maximum speed on the road and use the mobile when driving," says expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the work of stewards to be something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," Hanzelka concludes with the fact that the security control of buses is in the power of the police and the employment security authorities.
The hope of Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
The great words in the WestLB representative's letter to employees of this bank are not missing.
By combining the units of this Düsseldorf monetary institution with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, "the central financial group institution is set up for trading on the capital markets," let's read in a letter that came to the public on Monday.
According to WestLB's letter to this transaction, the "competence set" will be introduced to ensure the long-term yield.
Such a connection can, at all times, be a decisive impulse for further mergers in the banking sector.
Such texts occur when the representative wants to demonstrate the ability to act during the problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Commission but also on the part of the Social Supervisory Authority, whose communication from the Government of the country in North Pornium-Westphalia that it is now time to find a solution for the future, is still fresh.
The connection between Deca-Bank, which customers are familiar with for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever its kind, has been talking for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
Chief Deka-Bank Franz Waas, in presenting the half-year results of the management at the end of August, made it clear that in the merger of his home in Mainzer Landstraße with some of the country's banks, such as Helab or WestLB, there is no sense.
However, the Deka-Bank Board, which consists of one half of the country's bank and the other of its links, entrusted the board with conducting discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about trading on the capital market or part of it.
However, the talks just started, the financiers are running.
Deka-Bank, which is one of the most important employees on the financial market in Frankfurt with its 3000 employees, is not the first to speak about consolidation in the dispute sector.
In 2003, it seemed that it might be possible to merge Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and with Helab.
There was no end of this triangle.
Shortly after the Fusion plans were made public, the Hessen Land government expressed its opposition to the participation of Helaba.
Neither of the remaining banking houses did that.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz received Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart instead.
However, speculations about the connection of the Deka-Bank with the country banks have been repeated.
In recent times, however, Günther Merl, chairman of the Helab Bank, expressed negatively in speculation about the connection of his financial home with others.
It seems, however, that regardless of this, it appears that the approximation of the various banking houses in the public sector is necessary.
Now, after the elections to the country's snow in Bavaria, the BayernLB could be the first to begin to break up the connection with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
That's not exactly good news for Helab.
If pressure is to increase to further fusions, it is gradually becoming possible partners for such mergers.
In the south, it would only play a second puzzle, although the financial crisis has so far been significantly better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
At the beginning of the year, the association with WestLB was banned by Svaz Sporielen and the jury bank Hessen-Thüringen, which has a 50 per cent share in Helaba.
That's what North LB would look like.
Geostrategic considerations of this kind, however, are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much business models come together.
In June Merl announced that the decisive question which trade model should ensure the future competitiveness of the Land Banks, the German association of the Spouse Banks and the jury banks had not yet answered.
Everything could also end with a WestLB deployment, which, of course, nobody wants in this institution.
That's why the letter from the D.A. also speaks of trying to "complex solution" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect individual files to Deca-Bank, it will show time.
The second weekend of October is known as "the weekend with Italy"
For Elena, it's the first, for Luc, the third or the fourth.
But this time Elena's gonna be like his girlfriend, and then everything's gonna be different, he says.
Behind them, in a five-year court, the Kaiser brand stands a stronger lift and two hundred tourists at the Octoberfest show how deep the tone can release his throat.
Elena Lucu will dance first and then kiss him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus park next to the Puorta Nuova station, four buses with the designation "Destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", expected arrival 6.30 this evening.
Three buses contain mainly Italians, in one bus they drive exclusively Brazilians.
In one corner of the park, these South Americans sing with their flag, they've been celebrating at night.
And so out loud, says Marco Guard, it's nothing for Italy.
A Marc, who has a long coat with a skin-like flake and glasses with large silver rings, these three buses belong.
He's been driving them to Octoberfest for five years, only this year he's having three trips.
In the night there, during the day between the beer stand, at 22.30 p.m. back.
Overnighting would only mean unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The road is worth 75 euros, including a welcome drink by Kaiser, which is exactly cooked by the Bavarian Law on the purity of beer, health insurance and German speech guide - Marco went to Frankfurt for a language course.
Buses go into the night, heading for the car to Brenner.
Beer doesn't give up, not yet.
The bus is very quiet, the passenger sleeps.
They're doing well, they're still gonna need their powers.
It is located in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where on the 8th part of the road before Munich, another stop is being made and many other buses with an Italian flag.
When Marc's group finally arrives in the parking lot near Theresienwiese, about 50 other buses from all over Europe are standing there, according to the plan.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco has the last speech, explains the attack plan.
First, put on a yellow hat.
On her left is written "Oktoberfest", next to Marc's internet address of travel office: "conscersiviagiano.it".
The second is, "When the door is opened to the beer store, run away!" calls Marco into the morning air.
"Go!" Go and sit places in the back of the estate.
"Not in advance, so that you don't cross, and not all the yellow caps on the same sheet, spread around the space!"
It's worth 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget to be sloppy.
"Show the securitists that we behave properly.
When you leave your homes, they will leave."
And third, "Today is exactly the 11th of the night, so be here again!"
And up to Wiesn, room with beer.
One member of the group hangs yellow hats as marks on trees, cedars and even on the election poster of one big bavor party.
We need to get ready for the funeral.
As "the weekend with Italy" is the second weekend of October.
Accurate information on the number of visitors is not available; it is about fifty thousand people who are on their way to the Alps and are entering beer houses, ten percent of all visitors arrived from Italy this weekend.
A number of Munich police force forces seven South Tyrol policemen, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads to national statistics, in which the Italians before the British (approximately 60 attacks) and the Rakušany (approximately 80) with approximately 200 medical treatments occupy the first place.
It's especially popular with the Italians, Hofbräu.
No Nights for Believers Hypo Real Estate
Even last week, the Finance Minister of Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system was relatively stable.
It is good that this policy has used the word "relatively" and has also incorporated into its claim that the German banking sector will not remain the subject of crisis development.
Because it was the last weekend.
The index of Dax, a financial house dedicated to the financing of Hypo Real Estate (HRE) properties, will receive loans from the German bank consortium in the amount of several billion to protect against market turbulence.
The person informed of the situation on Monday said to Reuters that the loan aid referred to above would go up to EUR 35 billion.
The fees will have to pay Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only from the amount actually exhausted.
Money may come from private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of Depfa's subsidiaries.
According to the long-term news report, this public finances have been refinancing for extremely short-term loans, which is no longer possible due to the lack of confidence in markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserve dropped by 95 % to EUR 2.37 million and the share of its own capital decreased slightly from 1.6 to 1.45%.
Current income and net income from financial transactions compared to last year fell to zero, the income from increased receivables and from certain securities, as well as the cancellation of reserves for credit trade fell by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Due to the higher return on the subsequent accounting costs of restructuring the former Depfa Group and the interest rate refund according to the tax order and to the brokering of the trade for the group companies, the sixteen per cent reduction on the income side was still moderated.
The former state financier, after his privatization in 1990, burned himself on mortgages for the survivors, who were then removed from the portfolio of services and then led by Aareal Bank.
Due to the lack of resources in classical state funding, Depfa engaged more strongly in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects of private investors and state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and was diversifying internationally.
From the value of their subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate must now respond something and these copies will have "essential material effect" to calculate the profit and loss of the entire group, as some have been told.
The fact is, the dividend is not going to be.
It has already been reduced by two thirds for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate is a major financial operator of state and infrastructure projects since Depf was taken over.
More strongly than other institutions depend on refinancing on the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
After the fall of the US Investment Bank, Lehman Brothers practically raised the flow of interbank loans two weeks ago, as banks are monitoring liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs a year for part of the Depfa credit portfolio - about EUR 50 billion - short-term refinancing funds.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the financial needs of the group are covered by this loan for a reasonable period of time and the company is protected "before the impact of international cash markets at the moment to a significant extent of inability to function".
Other sources were reported to have provided refinancing by the end of 2009.
On the contrary, HRE Chairman Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the money markets at the appropriate time.
The Bank and the Financial Services Supervisory Authority (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate group is now on the market.
That's what the shareholders and the bank's believers hope for.
But given the dynamics and inability of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely excluded that the loan should not be exhausted.
But you can't rule out the opposite.
After the bank's late Sunday afternoon, according to everything that happened before the insolvency, he can't be pre-emptive, saved to relax eagerly.
The share price fell by 75 per cent to EUR 3.30.
On the contrary, the bonds were well held.
While the preferential debt has not moved virtually, the courses of other bonds are lost more prominently.
This concerns, in particular, the former subsidiary of Württemberg Hypo and the logical bond with the maturity period after 2009.
The Hypo-Real-State bonds initially looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability is required after a significant expansion of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself, which brought it into the company by taking over Depfa, to understand depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the issuing banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to calculate the value of the securities within their maturity period.
However, there may also be what is currently almost no one to respond to hope - the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports that are currently coming with this partial settlement, the only legitimate hope now is likely to be borderlined.
Especially to long-term believers, it is likely that they will prepare a number of awake nights when they will decide whether to give up their obligations.
Short-term investors may use the margin to at least create a transfer of losses from previous accounting periods to the short-term income of later years for the purpose of future payment of capital income tax.
Sylvana and secret of box belt
When the sixteen-year-old Sylvan Hiltrop's first day at the high school in Tacibana, the girls begin to cheer up: the German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from the manganese.
"The first day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I've been on my way to school.
I live in Tokyo on the way to Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to the center of Tacibana.
I had to find my way by myself, and luckily I didn't lose.
It doesn't seem that the beginning of Tacibana's education is given as hard as at our home in Lower Saxony.
Students start meeting after eight hours and twenty minutes before the ninth starts a short sitting with the teacher, so called 'home room'.
But before I started teaching, I was supposed to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk to people, but 40 students in front of class.
Because I haven't had a school uniform yet, I took on the old dress of my host mother, to this blouse, blue knees and black leather shoes.
So I stood up in front of the bench and tried to say everything right: 'Sajonara Wo still Sylvan...' - my name is Sylvan, I come from Germany, and I have my birthday in a week.
At that moment, I was very happy to learn a language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were squeaking, chichotting and moaning, and I still heard the word 'kawaii'.
I already knew that from my jaws.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls needed for survival and means 'sweet, sweet'.
Then I got into my place fast.
The girl next to me had quite a smile, she thought it was an honor to have a foreign student sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was rather quiet, but when the gang called, I was literally asleep.
They talked through each other and chichotalized and asked me about the possible and impossible - and then it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
Then, about the breakup, they all packed their bags.
My host mother also made me such a box for lunch - which is something else than boring German candles.
I had rice with herbs, small pies, salads and raisins, fruit and some kind of fish in the tofu doughnut.
Most people don't even know what's right here in Japan.
These things look special and taste quite new.
Of course, everything's really good.
Well, maybe to the salt-loaded sweatshirts, no!
Benta at Japanese schools is not just lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives the boy a self-prepared bento, which in this case is particularly artisticly adjusted, and hopes that the boy will know about the break at the kitchen.
That's what I read in my comic books.
I'm curious if I can see it here, too.
'Why is Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
'Cause it just fascinates me.'
After all, I've loved reading manga for years.
And to understand these comics and their culture better, I started to learn Japanese once.
So it was quite clear to me that I would have to come here once.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and habits.
And they're highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other, is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
And the rats have feelings
When a mouse or a frog escapes danger, does that mean they also feel afraid?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have feelings.
But how can it be verified if they feel the same way we do?
The online magazine "Edge" has been published for several years by well-known scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in her series presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true, without you being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else can prove that we can't even prove that they have other people of knowledge.
But in this case we can at least hope because all human brains have a consistent basic configuration.
However, once we start to devote ourselves to another species and open up the questions of perception or general awareness, we enter the inaccessible terrain because the hardware does not match.
When the mouse gets in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it pretends to be dead, wounded or attacked.
People behave similarly, some scientists detract from comparable subjective living.
I don't believe it, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure facilitate the transfer of our subjective life to animal life.
However, this is because the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its share in short-term memory and performance or management functions).
This vast area is much more developed in man than in other primates, and it seems that other creatures are missing.
At least in those aspects of our knowledge, which depend on the prefrontal cortex, the knowledge among them who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from other primitives.
Another dramatic feature could conceal a person’s language: because such a large part of his perception is connected to his language, it is often said to depend on him.
In this case, we could exclude the animals.
But even if knowledge of the language did not matter, it would certainly affect the language, so that animal knowledge, whether already constructed or not, would probably differ from most of the opinions of our knowledge.
So it's hard to find out what it looks like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it is not even possible to measure, because of the special hardware, to analyze on the basis of our own experience, it makes us examine it in the face of major problems.
Most of my outputs relate to the content of conscious living, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically available.
It would be possible to examine the processes in animal consciousness regardless of their content, and that is precisely what is happening in the short-term memory studies in the primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But this approach, devoted to Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses more on the neural roots of consciousness than on causative mechanisms: they can both be identical, but they may not be.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of a non-frontal cortex for visualisation.
What's behind this feeling?
I export them from the fact that an emotional system, such as a fear system, is activated in the brain, conscious of its own activity.
What we call "fear" is the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, like physical reactions) uses operational memory.
From this angle, feelings are closely linked to those areas of cortex that are characterized by primers, especially people.
In connection with the language nature, there is a fine detachment of perception, because we can distinguish and categorize the states by using words and grammar, so that we can assign them to each other.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings arise from the most primitive activities in the cortex and the brain region, like Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Because this network has not changed too much during human evolution, it could share peacefully in the feelings of the many life - forms.
I can't resist it theoretically, but I think it's invincible.
Panxeep argues that what appears to us in the rat and people as fear is likely to feel the same: How is it possible to verify, says Panxeep, whether the rats and people feel the same when they behave similarly?
He's afraid of danger, too?
From my point of view, it is not just the similarity of behavior to show the compatibility of living.
It is true that the neural comparison is moving us further: the rats and people have similar brain stems, in contrast to the fungus and the brain.
But is he responsible for the brains?
And even if it's possible to prove it in person: how would we want to prove it in the cross?
I believe that rats and other frogs, perhaps even wet (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how I should prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I'd rather examine emotional behavior than emotional perception.
In any case, in this case, we can wait for progress at the neural level if we measure the same for rats and humans.
Just as I don't study language and knowledge at the cross, I don't study feelings, but I don't know if they exist.
It's possible to be shortsighted, but I'd rather go ahead than throw myself against the wall again.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
President UEFA Platinum: Period of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said preparations would soon be directed directly by the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA decision in Bordeaux as evidence of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organise ME together with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
"But it's not amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there's a lot more to do in both countries."
In the timely fulfillment of the timetable of the construction or refurbishment of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts are begging.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME is reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work as quickly as possible," said the President of the Ukrainian Union Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA will keep watching us."
A more radical step was agreed in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish PZPN has been revoked after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlock.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Mirosław Drzewieck.
There is a "serious danger that PZPN will not be able to act in accordance with the rules," said the Polish press agency PAP Drzewiecki.
"Chairman of UEFA Michel Platini's letter assures us that this step will not result in preparation for ME 2012."
Several teams from the first league were only sentenced to forced retirement in the last season, and had to have even moved the beginning of the league.
Encouraging Dennis Quaid Returns Attack
She wanted to advertise a new movie, talk about private things - and now she has problems with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan spoke about her former Dennis Quaid as a marriage breaker.
That's the one that's gonna blow and hit back.
The late war rose at the former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after the divorce, these two Hollywood actors are leading an inappropriate dispute - in front of the public's eyes.
Meg Ryan, in his interview with the American magazine InStyle last week, first said for the reasons of her marriage: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She learned about the extent of the fraud until after the divorce.
The emphasis on this mental stripty was the PR work of Ryan for her new film "The Women" - the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was significant: "It's crazy," said a 40-year-old artist in New York Daily News, "Meg relives the history of our relationship and corrects it".
It's also "politicizing" that to Jack's 16-year-old common son again "is a public reminder of the pain and radical changes that are a divorce for every child."
While Ryan lives alone from divorce, Quaid is again married and recently became a father of twins.
His thoughts on moving are as follows: "My life goes on anyway.
I think I'm happy to have a wonderful family that's doing great."
Prices of flights and hotels drop
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to one current study, in Germany, there were even less than 50 percent of the cost.
Flights and accommodation in the hotels again took place - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analysed its data on the reservations made since the first half of 2008 and found their significant decrease in the second quarter following the rise in prices in the first quarter.
After several years of price growth on the hotel market, accommodation in many places has already grown.
Between January and March, prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed, on average, by 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most careful trend was in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
For the reason of this trend, American Express considers a weak dollar course that has caused "the fading taste of American tourists to travel".
The decrease in hotel prices was also more affected by the financial centres than by the industrial centres, such as Hanover, Kolín nad Rín or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, the prices of hotels increased by 26.3 percent even recorded a European record.
The prices of the aircraft also showed a further upward trend in the first quarter:
Due to the reduction of kerosene, passengers in the Economist class had to pay on average 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, up to 29.2 per cent for fuel long-range flights.
From April to June, the prices of flights in the Economie class dropped by 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, but changes in the business and First-Class classes were less significant.
In Germany, prices fell even higher than in other European countries:
From January to March, 11.9 per cent increased, 23.6 per cent decreased in the second quarter.
In the German national years, according to the study quoted, prices dropped even half.
One of the reasons for this price fall is slowing economic growth, explains the company.
The demand in many segments of the air transport market does not exist.
On the other hand, there is an increase in competition pressure due to the Open Skies agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the USA and Europe.
The sign of a tense situation is the destruction of non-profit lines by air carriers and also the high number of airlines that announced a competition in the first half of 2008 - only 24 airlines in Europe.
HSV channel Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to one branch and simple methods, Hamburger SV gets to the front of the table.
In Borussia Luhukay is still unable to make up a functioning eleven.
He wrote Christopher Klein - to increase Unsuccessful landings for the representative of Marko Marina.
This player from Gladbach joined the game until late and did not succeed with a sprayed balloon on the point.
His message was accurately formulated and expressed out of his mouth with conviction.
He just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," said Hermann Rieger in walking to the hamburg arenas.
It didn't do much in the catacombs, the break between half-times ended, and most people were sitting in their seats again.
Rieger was HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades and enjoyed greater respect than many immediate actors.
And so his request was also heard at the responsible place.
Coach Cornelius Jol's assistant touched and on the sign of the agreement he raised his finger.
Cornelius is the brother of Master Coach Martin Jola.
His command must have sounded like this: I'm here with the other head!
It didn't work out.
"It didn't look good here today," Marcel Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have been "the desire of the more relaxed."
For 1:0 (1:0) Hamburcan thanks to Mladen Petrić's head (11) and the circumstances that the very weak hungerlights could not harm the weak Hamburcans.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV celebrates its existence this Monday for 121 years.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena, and the live updated table on the video platform, where their team was listed as the premiere.
It'll be birthdays without a good party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcel Jansen.
They think that the transient tabloid result symbolizes the incalcibility of the league rather than the domination of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - the Brazilian Nevese and Silvy, the Petrić and the FC Bayern who won Jansen - is located slowly, but can't shine yet.
"We need more sense and more dribbling," Jol said.
After the vote
Fear spreads on Wall Street.
The first reports of the sinking of the rescue package resulted in a decrease in the Dow Jones index of up to 700 points.
It was the greatest point of loss within one day in his history.

As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called damaged mortgages.
However, the total amount should not be paid back, but in several stages.
The payment shall be made on the basis of a separate list of financial companies that could be paid in favour of the course, thereby reducing the burden on the State budget.
Action courses in Europe fall sharply
billion aid to banks in Europe and the United States is not beyond doubt.
The stock price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is highly affordable and downloadable with Dax index.

Dark mass affects the flight of space probes
For years scientists have not been aware of the advice of one mysterious phenomenon: the dark mass affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver (gravitation brush).
Experts fear that the general theory of Albert Einstein's relativity should not be entirely correct.
Almost 18 years ago, the space probe "Ulysses" flew through the universe.
The guilt of fuel management, which will soon freeze, now threatens her with the death of winter.
Among scientists for years, one mysterious phenomenon has affected the confusion - anomaly of gravity.
The gravitational beam is a flying maneuver of space probes, where they gain additional mobility in the gravitational field of some space body, such as the Earth.
That's why the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What scientists have been saying for years in this case is that flying bodies are not kept to a degree as a person would expect under an old law of gravity.
On the contrary, there is an irregularity in speed.
The probes speed up or slow down unexpectedly.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
He was baptized by anomaly in a gravitational bag.
Several experts are afraid that even the general relativity theory of Albert Einstein, which describes the attractiveness of mass by bending the space, should not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton is still convinced that Einstein was wrong, and tries to explain the anomalies of gravity through so-called dark mass, whose presence in the universe has been detected by astronomers.
"The responsibility for this anomaly could be a dark mass that could also be located very close to the Earth," he writes.
The existence of a dark mass is known only to space researchers for about ten years.
It is obviously a gravitational force whose effect on other universe bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, she is completely invisible, which means that she does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, just the visible light.
Scientists estimate that this dark mass is a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
In Egypt, the kidnapping of tourists is free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, according to the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, they will be taking tourists back to Egypt.
The Sudanese refugees demanded a ransom of several million euros.
When the shooter was released, six kidnappings were killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The deal on the ransom is already in progress.
The Germans repeatedly become the target of kidnappings.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourist attractions on the Sahara are, according to all, free.
They informed of this in agreement by Egyptian state television, the Arabic Al-Arab television station and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, according to reports of the Italian TV station Sky TG 24, confirmed the release: "Our associates and other hostages were released.
We're just checking their health status," Frattini said.
According to the Egyptian State TV, there are five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian leaders in order and security.
All 19 participants in the expedition to the desert are already on their way to Kahiry.
The unclear remains the background of the shooter before the handcuffs were released: according to the Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were prepared to finish the abduction even before the Sudanese army suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with the ransom," the quoted employee said.
It was already "it was just to take over the handcuffs," when the sudden "this surprise" came.
On Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, the Sudanese soldiers shot six prisoners, and two of them were captured.
The arrests asked for a ransom of EUR 6 million; the German wife of one of the hostages had to transfer the money.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" with a call to one of the German mediators stated that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to this report, they wanted to miss out on the hands of women after paying the ransom.
Men were to be kept until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Kahir refused to comment on this report.
The abuse of my father led to suicide.
Several years of fatherly abuse led a woman to kill herself, sounding before the court.
After admitting eight cases of sexual harassment, seven-year-old Michael Treise from Stithians in Cornwall was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court in Truro has heard that his own daughter, Stephanie Randle, was regularly tied up when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," Treise wrote in a statement.
The court was also told that Ms Randle was killed in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child living in Coventry, Treise tied her eyes and then abused her sexually while her mother worked in the hospital.
Treise and his wife divorced in the '80s and returned to Cornwall.
His own daughter went to Plymouth.
However, before the trial, it was reported that Ms Randleo, who spent a substantial part of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust organization, was following the example of abuses that had been committed twice a week on her.
Judge Ramsey Quaife stated in court that in 2006 Ms. Randle's friends, who were also very devoted to surfing and cyclisting, that she was "emotionally dead" and that "she gave up her life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She's supposed to suffocated with an igelite bag.
Randle stood face to face with his own father, who wrote a confession, which ended with the words, "I hugged her and hugged her eyes.
"I didn't abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris said, "You're an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been horrible for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking his life.
Even worse is the fact that if she didn't do so, the case would probably not have been brought before the court."
"In particular, I would like to highlight the consequences of your crime on their daughter in those years, according to Stephanie's parents," he added.
"It would probably be a promising, successful and happy young woman."
The official who has lost his data will be charged
The BBC has learned that a government official who left very secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two strictly secret documents on the Waterloo train at a time when he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents came into the hands of the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is at least a serious crime against that law and does not imply a criminal purpose.
BBC writer Frank Gardner said such a move would be surprising for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought that the matter was being settled internally between the Ministry and the Government," he said.
An employee who is not to be appointed shall be charged under Section 8.1 of the Act in question, which is a clause which deals with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police officer complain on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot contained secret analyses of Al-Qaida and the possibilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from home to an unknown place.
Corporate deposits in debt B&B
The British social trust may have to settle for more than 80 million pounds after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley.
The government has provided 2.6 million customers in Bradford & Bingley 14 billion pounds.
The loans will be paid by all companies that receive client deposits, including 59 social bases.
The Director General of the Association of Societal Foundations (BSA) Adrian Coles said it was "submissive", that depositors and their members had to pay.
Fourteen billion debt will finally be paid by saving Bradford & Bingley's mortgages.
However, the interest, which is in the meantime, will pay every year to all 700 financial corporations that take client deposits.
The Bank's Compensation Plan for the Bank confirmed that all 59 social bases are included in this item.
It is humiliating that these institutions, which have been carefully... now have to pay some of the accounts of those institutions that have not been so careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company was to pay in proportion to the deposits it held and that the deposits were to pay about 18 % of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the debt-to-debt increase in 2009 to 450 million pounds.
This means that deposits will have to find 81 million pounds to pay interest from the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of Societies, told the BBC that he is convinced that it is not fair.
"It is humiliating that the institutions that acted seriously during the expansion of the housing market must now pay some of the accounts of those institutions that have not been so serious."
According to the BSA, no deposit since 1945, when it appeared, had fallen.
"We will have to look into all aspects of this over the next few weeks to see what are the opportunities to protect social security and their members from the account that could be significant," Cole added.
The sentence applicable in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest will be paid over the year and that could be almost twice as much.
In view of the fact that the shareholdings are shareholdings without shareholders, this account will eventually pay their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk contains five pence per litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
Ms. Jersey announced that she would increase the wholesale price of her milk by five pence per litre from Monday.
This year, it is the second price increase, after two-pence cancellation in February, and comes after the research carried out by the consulting company.
Retailers shall decide on their own whether they wish to reflect the distortion at customer prices.
Before the fall, the wholesale price of Jersey milk was changed in 2002.
No bail for Bangladeshi expremier
The Bangladesh court rejected the application of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Vadzid for bail, which means that if he returns to the government, he can be arrested.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to release her for bail in connection with the charge that she had obtained over 50 million dollars (729,700) from a certain entrepreneur when she was a prime minister.
The case is one of several charges of corruption brought against it.
Chalda Zija, a long-standing political rival of Shikh Hasina, was released earlier this month on bail.
Sheikh Hasina is to return to Bangladesh over the next few weeks, but her party, the League of People (Awami League), asked that the local army hold her full freedom first.
Writers say that while she was allowed to speak in an honest manner in order to take part in a foreign medical procedure, it is not clear whether she will remain free until she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say that the Supreme Court's regulation is now being appealed to the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Shich Hasina's application for bail because he does not need bail when he is already conducting an investigation for an honest declaration abroad," said her guardian Rafique-ul Huq.
"We appeal against the Supreme Court's regulation."
Her lawyers claimed she needed bail so that she could return to the country for preparation for the December elections.
The High Representative of the League of People said that Sheikh Hasin should return home after October 17.
She was detained last year after the army held by the temporary government took over, but she was released from prison in June in order to move abroad to a medical procedure.
Sheikh Hasina and Chalda Zija both reject all charges brought against themselves.
Fear of policing against the defence in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 children did not participate in the recent flat-rate attack against the Taliban-related violence.
Last week, the United Nations carried out vaccination in six provinces.
However, it says that for security reasons, children in the South could not be reached in Helmand and Kandahar.
The UN spokesperson stated that even through the Taliban's promises, he would not attack or defend thousands of occupiers at work.
BSkyB lost the ITV court dispute
The company BSkyB lost the court dispute concerning the review of the Commission’s decision on competition, which the company ordered to reduce its share in the competitive broadcast of ITV.
The Board of Appeal ordered BSkyB to reduce its share in ITV from 17,9 % below 7,5 %.
The Commission stated earlier that the share of BSkyB had dreamed of a competitive fight and had had an immeasurable impact on ITV.
BSkyB bought the share in 2006 in a trade that, as a result of preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, ITV buy.
In April 2007 the Fair Trade Authority announced that the acquisition of ITV participation in BSkyB caused doubts about the independence of ITV and called on the Commission to initiate the investigation.
The head of the Virgin Consortium Sir Richard Branson, consumer organization and regulator Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its share in ITV was unreasonable and as a disproportional solution - above all because BSkyB had previously said that it was willing to give up its voting rights.
New investigation of US lawyers' affair
The US Prime Minister appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine US lawyers in 2006.
This was the case when the report on the affair, drawn up by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, criticised the activity of government officials.
The report criticised officials of the White House, legislator and former Justice Minister Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by concerns about the removal of lawyers for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers of the investigation were lying to the investigators in order to justify justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine stated in the report: "The serious complaints including potential criminal proceedings have not been fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the authority to bring witnesses to speak was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the US Ministry of Justice released nine US lawyers in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry stated that lawyers had been released for poor performance.
Later, however, it was shown that the release of lawyers was not judged to be anything worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to conclude that the release was politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers have been involved in the prosecution of highly-established Republican MPs and senators, while others have refused to investigate the allegations of the wills brought against the Democrats.
U.S. lawyers are investigating and conducting appeals in court cases outside the government.
They may be released at any time, but they must not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, got himself fired and finally resigned.
The number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice has also risen.
The Commissioner-General's report on the role of Gonzales in the affair was very critical, saying that he was carrying the "main responsibility" for the release of "abdicating" from his leadership and in fact "not appreciably engaged".
Other officials, including former High Councillor Carl Rowe, were criticised for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's duke will be rated
The Rock Star Meat Loaf will get one of the Q Awards prizes for its epic hymn Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who, for his special gold prize, will attend the ceremony next weekend in London, said he was "honored" by his recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title song of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
This year's nomination is led by the Coldplay group, which has been selected in four categories.
Paul Rees, the editor-in-chief of Magazine Q, said: "There are some songs that stand over such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed large vocals that met Loaf provided.
It started instrumental parts that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in Britain in 1979 as a single and reached the highest in the 15th place.
But Meat Loafo's Bat Out Of Hell album was held in a fingerprint for about nine years and sold it around the world more than 40 million copies.
Meat Loaf, a real name Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from health problems in recent years, and in 2003 has also been operated due to irregular heart rhythms after collaborating on the podium.
In 2007, the acute laryngitis forced him to cancel the concerts.
Later it turned out that he had a vocal cyst.
Obesity streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, roads and other terrestrial communications, some famous, others only useful.
But even a lot of vets and long-term locals have trouble finding Extra Place, most of them because they've never heard of it.
This small street is in the quarter East Village and leads north of the First Street - without getting to the Second Street - between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten and a length of 40 meters, it is more like an empty passage than a transport train.
There's no sign of the street.
It's practically invisible in the ordinary atlas.
Still, he's got the admirer's street.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of recently built luxury buildings on the First Street.
He wants Extra Place to redesign and create a cleaner gateway to shops and shops that are to be opened in new buildings.
Other admirers are the long-lasting neighbors who say that they were surprised by the street charm simply because it was one of the last remnants of time before the block was destroyed.
However, the City Authority for the Protection and Development of a building that has its own power does not have the slightest interest in keeping it.
At the meeting of the General Community Land Committee, the representatives of the City Authority and Avalon Bay planned a plan that would allow developers to buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, the District Manager of the General Community 3, the Committee prefers a variant where the streets will remain in the hands of the city and asked for a new plan to be put in place next month.
"The city already owns only very few lands, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its ownership," she said.
"They could be proposed for correction and administration, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public access."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that she wanted to re-launch a small street and to sit in places where several of them would use the coffee shop, whose interest in renting space the developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, talker Avalon Bay, said that while the company wants to use the street, it doesn't have to own it.
"The main purpose of Avalon Bay is to repair this abandoned street and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said and added that the sale proposed the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Foundation's Maintenance Office, said that the city actually wanted to sell the street, and he suggested that the purpose of his office was to develop the property rather than to manage.
Compared to his colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a small mark in history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when the big farm of Philip Minthorna was divided between several of his children and on that narrow road of the country, no one made a claim.
To Extra Place, the back door of CBGB, a punk monument that closed in 2006, and the street is perhaps the most famous as the background of a photograph on the shore of the Ramones group's album "Rocket to Russia".
"It was a wonderful place," says Danny Fields, manager Ramones, who took a photo in November 1976.
"They were full of waste, broken clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, sheets and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers, who write about honoring the East Village district, are opposed to the idea of selling Extra Place and claiming that it is a piece of public property, be modest, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place to be a rarity - almost unchanged part of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog on behalf of Jeremiah’s mishap in New York (with the title "The Book of Crushes: a bitter nostalgic view of the city in the process of measuring), explained a part of the story about Extra Place from the title Talk about the city, which appeared in The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow blind street, dark even on the day and limited by the narrow iron doors of the warehouses and closed windows, where the old newspaper runs through the streets for the week."
Except for a few exceptions, the street of one recent evening looked exactly the same.
Krysa walked through the blind end of the street near the door that once led to CBGB, where today there is a trade in expensive clothes.
There were graffiti on the floor and next to the fresh dose of the damaged news lay an empty beer tray.
A few college students said they think about Extra Place a little, but they suggested that some kind of boost could be given to him.
On the contrary, Fields said that they think that some people underestimate the activity of the street in its present state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in the dark, wet and resistant places."
Bilinguality debate: English subduction
In this section, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the position of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic worker from California and the director of the field of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Better Than You Think: Why Secondary Class Needs to Choose Schools".
Effectively addressing the Spanish voters is an upheaval.
Barack Obama's educational agenda just proves it.
Obama's campaign suggests that "Afro-American and Spanish students have a significantly lower probability that they deserve more than white students," which is true.
In order to fight with such performance differences, Obama's educational agenda is particularly encouraged by, inter alia, "previous bilingual education" for those who are only learning English.
The question of Barack Obama remains, however, whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on using languages other than English in the class, is not more powerful than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Let's take the example of Sixth Street Prep, the charter elementary school in the Los Angeles East.
The students of this school are, in general, in most cases, the Hispanic from low-copy families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom came from just recently, are only learning English.
Even so, in the national mathematics tests in 2008, hundreds of students in the fourth grade were reached at the highest level.
Nearly ninety-three percent of the fourth grade students were reached at the highest level in English-language and literature state tests.
This incredible success was achieved by a different method than Obama prefers.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and exercise, constant assessment of abilities and access without excuses.
Furthermore, and Obama should note this, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the pedagogical approach of the school for those who are only only learning English, is "full humiliation".
Undermining in English highlights the almost essential use of English when teaching.
Miss Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, said to me, "We had a great success with one completely new student from Mexico - after twelve months you would enter the class and not know what it is."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take the school as a Sixth Street Prep as an example of how other schools with large portions of Spanish and English students should look?
The results achieved by the school should be made clear from the answer to this question, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Education Association is a long-standing advocate of bilingual education) and its own consistent support of bilingual education undermines Obama’s prediction of the answer.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently triviad when he said that people should stop worrying about "English" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wants to reduce performance differences, he should think carefully about the educational patterns that work rather than make fun of them and trivialize them.
The oil of the pipeline decreases due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices fell on Monday because of fears that even an American plan to save financial markets would not have to revive the economy.
The price of fixed oil trades dropped by 7 per cent in the early trade at the New York Stock Exchange to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, prices have dropped by more than $20 a barrel.
In the last two weeks, markets with comets have been disrupted by financial disturbances on Wall Street and also by a double of strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, the price fell to almost $90 per barrel earlier this month, which again resulted in huge financial market uncertainty.
The anxiety rekindled the investors on Monday, even after the Congress Presidency announced that the weekend had reached agreements on the biggest rescue plan in history.
This report was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the most recent episode of the divorce, the government announced that the Citigroup would buy the Banking Department of Wachovia Corporation.
Between Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg governments partially established the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
The analysts of Barclays Capital said that a lively weekend conversation that led to a plan to save the economy "are shown as unable to revive the mood on the market".
As the economic situation worsens, the demand for comets, including oil, is expected to decline.
"Monitors for markets with global shares, interest rates and monetary courses have been severely defeated," analysts from Deutsche Bank wrote to investors in the report.
"We believe that the comets will not be able to escape the plague.
From a comet perspective, our greatest concern is the extent to which the American virus is spreading throughout the world and especially to China."
The analysts of this bank limited their expectations for next year, as oil consumption decreased due to slow economic growth and reduced their forecasting of gas prices for 2009 by about 20%.
The wild ride in the second quarter exceeded the record of the team
After he spent the last eight seasons in the Jets dress more than anyone else, the defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen everything.
Then on Sunday he watched the development of the second quarter in which Jets changed the play of free in the Spanish drive.
"I've never seen anything like this," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after Jets and the Arizona Cardinals were leveled by the dark clouds over themselves.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranueuse College to a 12-day touch-and-spin, which perfectly represented the afternoon, in which their progressive development cooperation moved about a mile ahead.
Favre sent Colese in this quarter behind two other touchdowns, including the one in which the cornererback fell, and another 10 seconds before the mid-war.
"It was nothing extraordinary," said Favre about all his recordings to Coles.
"He's a damn good player.
It's been a great communication, whatever people think."
While Favre and Coles had them, the defense attacked Cardinals Kurt Warner's quarterback.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught the wrong shot and returned him by 32 yards to touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith tipped out another tape and caught her.
Linebacker David Bowens donated Warner to the fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens invented, was perhaps even the best.
Team Cardinals got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after Jets got the ball back, he dug Jay Feely's twenty-yard goal out of the field, and he got the lead 34-0.
That's the most important thing Jets ever got in one quarter.
The Jets Eric Mangini, when he was called to describe the madness, said, "Other quarter, or third quarter?"
When he was told that they both - Jets allowed 21 points in a third quarter without a reply - Mangini said, "I can tell you that the second quarter I enjoyed much more than the third.
A drop of many points in a short time section."
Retired Gebreselassie has improved its world record
Haile Gebreselassie from Ethiopia again showed why many consider him the best distant runner even when on Sunday in the Berlin marathon he crossed his own world record and became the first man to run 26.2 miles of race under two hours and four minutes.
The victory on a pleasant flat track at 2:03:59 changed in 27 seconds his previous time 2:04:26, which ran last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassie, 35, created a 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - won the world record or is at least the world's champion at all distances from the metro mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie escaped the Olympic marathon in Beijing, because he was afraid - from a backward perspective perhaps too scared - that the polluted air would solve his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - the sun and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the goal - won the Sunday Gebreselassie with a blizzard average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
What trajectories like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya focused on the longer track, dropped the marathon record in the past decade for more than two minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselas told reporters that he had a two weeks ago running away and missed a week of training.
The pause was obviously more than a hold-up.
"I'm so happy," Gebraselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I was a little in doubt today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticised - mainly in Kenya, the East African rival Ethiopia - for planning his races over and over again, generally avoiding the world's marathon peaks, relying on guides, as if it were a race on the track, and building world records on the meaning of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie's enormous running quality.
Held in the tempo by four Kenyans reached Gebreselasia half of the time 1:02:04.
After the leaders fell away, Gebreselassi was constantly chased by two elite race runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
About something before three miles before the goal of Gebreselassie last took and ran away to Kwambai, who then reached the second place at 2:05:36 and thus improved his personal maximum in about five minutes.
Kamathi finished the third at 2:07:48.
In the race women finished the excellent year with the seventh fastest time of history 2:19:19 Irina Mikitzynk, a relative from Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen.
Record time 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Forty years Mikitínk's surprisingly won last year in the spring in London's marathon at 2:24:14.
Beijing games left behind for something that was described as a back injury, but she recovered and won in Berlin and in the third marathon, which she used to run, improved her personal maximum by almost five minutes.
The race ran cleverly and thoughtfully: she let four Ethiopian and Kenyan races escape into a big leap and then reached about 18 1⁄2 miles.
Ascale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia arrived second at 2:21:31 and Helen Kippa from Kenya finished the third at 2:25:01.
Hedgehogs and obstacles to the life of blacks in a separate city
Hidden among the famous Orlando amusement park, several miles from everything bright, loud and grand, lies a quiet city in which the pride and ambition of African-American life are relished.
Eatonville, the first completely black town, which was incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the town of five lakes, three Crocketts, three hundred browns, three hundred good swimmers, the supply of quays, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a resort.
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatonville Zora festival to make up the gift of Hurston, the most famous female writer of Harlem Renaissance.
The city that she described remains a party, even though she stopped it for tourists by including it in the Florida tourist guide created by Federal Writers from the time of the economic crisis.
It is still as independent, dignified and private as it was in the thirties when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their real feelings with a white man who "knows us so little that he doesn't even know what's coming."
Even today, in a year when the Montenegrin presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open debate on race, many of the inhabitants here remain vigilant in view of foreign views.
"We are paying close attention to how our story is told," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lives here from birth and is a member of the oldest farce in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a triumph paradox and an anthem.
It is both a historical model of Montenegro's rise, and a community of nearly 2400 people, where the poverty rate is double against the international average.
It is a centre of literature, but also a deep shadowed example of Southern rural black culture - sometimes challenged, sometimes praised - that arose from American slavery.
It's not too surprising that the inhabitants here are both proud and protective.
And the worries about Eatonville's show really started when Zoro, which is the only way that Hurstons are called here.
She presented her hometown to the world through her heart-filled book "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God (their eyes followed God)" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida tourist guide changed the city to road No. 17, which leads through the frequent mixed centre of Florida, to the stage of black history and human drama.
With the outbreak of the big drum in life and in the literature, Hurston led readers into the shop of the first Eatonville mayor Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"The left side of the road," she wrote, "is a white nested modern national school with well-maintained halls and playgrounds, which Howard Miller is always old, even though he can't read much or write."
She also mentioned the new widow of Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all sorts and whatever fits into the hourly hotel."
So only a few hundred words connected Hurston Eatonville with self-government, but also with indignity, refurbishment of babies and sex.
This obviously wasn't typical of Fodor's loading.
In fact, it wasn't a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it the way it was," says 19-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls, who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang simple songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
In Hurston, she still remembers herself as a chipper, who often returned after her family moved to Florida's Jacksonville.
Seventy - year - old Augustus Franklin recalls that most of the time when she arrived in the city, she arrived without a report in the huge Chevrolet, smoked and wore pants in the city, which today is proud of clothing.
Most of the people were fascinated, said Franklin, but many were fighting.
"People of Zora always like to see," said Franklin.
But, he added, he's jumping on a chair on the back terrace with a view of Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were cut out of the press.
It seemed that Eatonville and the rest of the world had forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, contemporary Langstone Hughes and the only blacksmith at Barnard College in the 20th century, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Florida Fort Pierce, where she lived before.
In Eatonville, there were no bigger mourning rituals or large public readings.
"I don't think they understood her significance for the world, nor her reference," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's "Wrapped in Rainbows" in 2003.
The change came in the 1980s.
The representatives of the Orange County period wanted to extend the city to the five-way road instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local two-way main road.
Orlanda's landing has already pushed through Interstate Road No. 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still getting from a complicated historical period.
The forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950 ’ s, the struggle to mix race brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
"At that time, a party of white boys, they came and threw oranges and things on the people who sat on the side," said Franklin.
"We actually had one lady here who killed it.
They walked out of the car melon."
In a letter from The Orlando Sentinel in 1955, Hurston questioned the requirement of the Supreme Court for forced integration and his decision in the Brown case against the education chamber declared that "it is more offensive than celebrating for my race."
Citizens now claim that the disaggregation of schools, although in some areas positive, has reduced coherence in Eatonville and undermined the courage of young people.
"Black children were used to hug - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Elly Dinkins and executive director of the Preserve the Eatonville Community (Save the Eatonville Community).
It lasted until the teachers and students came from the same place, added.
"You don't include your white teacher, because your white teacher - I mean, there's a cultural barrier," said Ms. Nathiri.
However, civil law has helped to create space for many other Zory Neale Hurston - black writers, artists and artists who, like her, have raised themselves above prejudices with lexical self-consciousness and quoted as such as "How can someone resist my pleasure?
I don't get it."
In 1975, Alice Walker arrived at the unmarked tomb of Hurston and began to fight for her reputation.
Five years later, Hurston’s well-adopted life story from Robert E. Hemenway came to the police in the bookstores, which reorganized her into the American cannon.
The road project arrived just when the most famous daughter of Eatonville again found light ramp.
The former neighbors of Hurston now considered her a savior.
In 1988, the community began to plan the Hurston Festival to show what could happen to destroy its route.
Thousands of fans arrived at the opening event two years later, and every ice is returning many to the celebration.
After a few years, the state withdrew from the road map.
"These five flows of the road have risen, you'd say it's a direct fire, a real civil pride," said Nathiri.
Boyd said it simpler: "Zora saved Eatonville."
Victory over the road project has helped change the image of the city.
Other places like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to attend the present church in 1993, began to appear in larger numbers, and the people began to reassess the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
The new one-father library (of course named after Hurston) was opened in 2006 with Kennedy Boulevard being reopened and demolished.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: only six miles from the center of Orlanda can sometimes act as a western street in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1980s.
(90 per cent black today.)
With other people who come looking for the story and the meaning of Eatonville, it is still often treated with caution.
Permission for most of the interviews is necessary to have something ahead and certain things - like wall paintings in the oldest eatonville church that painted whites and that show blacks on the fields - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Jones, a courageous, self-relianced teacher who likes a network of reds, still fear that their isolated community will not be correctly understood.
And even as Hurston's festival grew, domestic pride also increased.
In particular, young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw the whole race: beautiful, with problems and so on, but not better, not worse and as proud, creative, hardworking, stupid and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
From Franklin's voice, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, sounds a sincere love for the village when he plans to return to Eatonville after high school to work in the local government or with the police who says he's going to have some help.
And even younger, such as eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenonova, it seems, they learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they go through here, will think, 'Hm, this town is nothing against the others,' said Alondra Kenon recently Sunday after church.
"But if you really stop and look for a moment in history, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, we're all talking financial gas.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from news stations and huge television images on Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were standing in the middle of the storm.
They would never have decided that in a blizzard, offices over their heads have every day bankers and managers of investment funds that monopolies New York, the worst "bad day in the office" since the 1929 crisis.
Senders keep counting metal vehicles by the wayside and transport muffin bakers to the breakfast meeting.
The Hispanics are still moving between the towers and carrying, like human mules, fifty blessed baskets hanging from the trousers on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in front of their early bagel at the street dining stations, and it is still not possible to get on the day of the yellow taxi between the fourth and seventh afternoon.
It didn't look like a crisis at all until, with all the talk about poetry, I decided to set up a burning account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I was timing this task so that he could cover up with a late afternoon set on my local JP Morgan Chase, there were about 20 people waiting on the front.
Not in front of the treasured windows to pick up or save cash, but in front of the check books where older customers order, tourists ask for a way to trade with Macy's mixed goods and new customers set up accounts.
Most of the people before me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker", came for the same reason as me.
However, they have already chosen their savings from smaller banks in places where they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They chose money from so-called triffs (a little similar to construction spongiforms), cash companies and from those types of spongiforms whose branches operate only in one country and who claim to care for their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks were silent.
A few days ago Washington Mutual, a bank with assets for $327 billion, went to the contest, and when the New Yorkers returned home on Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, with assets for $440 billion, tried to catch the rescue buyer.
Officials of the offices and shops, who stood before me and feared another collapse, moved their cash to a bank, which is perceived as a safe port and which makes most of the savings on Wall Street.
In the last week, the ordinary New Yorkers learned gas finance.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, the amazing banker, and her poor senior executive, Dick Fuld, as if she were talking about a lazy colleague.
And Lynn, a uniformed nearly fifty-year-old home of my kitchen, has changed the subject of our usual conversation - Brad, Angelina or my food supplies.
After my visit to the bank, she said, "I now have my savings in the money market.
I moved it, I won't risk it."
Muslim graves ravaged by the Austrian Right Crime
Heinz-Christian Strache, left, of the Austrian Right-wing Freedoms and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian Right-wing Vlaams Belang with a participating event that presented in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008 the organization "Citys Against Islamization".
They are similar to the transport marks that show the mixtures crossed by the red line.
The police accuse the right extremists of exorcising the Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend, in which the right parties have achieved enormous profits in general elections.
Over 90 graves in the cemetery in Traun near Linze were once between Friday evenings and this morning it was hard to destroy and the police are convinced it was an organized action.
The guilty insisted on some graves of Jewish symbols, such as David’s star, but the detectives are convinced that it could be an attempt to mask the motives of extremists led by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It's not clear whether this incident has been associated with elections.
The spokesperson of the Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" with reports of disillusionment coming at the time of the end of the Muslim post month Ramadan.
In the meantime, Austria enters the search engine of its own soul after transport has collapsed in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
Both parties, who had received more than 30 per cent of the votes, the free party and the Swaz for the future of Austria, carried out a campaign against immigration and some of their slogans were criticised as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Feare, the president of the Free People's Party, who won 18 per cent of the vote, protested against gossip and gossip in the campaign, and even expressed his opposition to the food in which the relationship to Islam is perceived.
At the last meeting with the voter in Vienna, he spoke of "European brotherhood", which should prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mixtures and minerals and argue that these are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Research and analysis carried out immediately following the elections that set the extreme right to the position of the strongest political bloc in the country indicate that this change was caused primarily by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter doesn't have to travel abroad
Gary Glitter, a glamorous star who was convicted of sexual abuse of children, has banned the court from travelling to France and Spain.
The officials imposed this six-month ban on Glitter after informing the monitoring authorities that he plans to travel across France to Spain.
The Kent police had this ban on the expulsion of children last Thursday after giving the officials evidence of the Glitter's previous judgments on sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, on his own name Paul Gadd, did not participate in Ashford's lowest criminal court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Cork Binning.
The Judicial Service said: "On Thursday, 25 September, at Ashford's lowest criminal court, the Kenyan police asked for a regulation that would prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the border to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd didn't personally participate."
64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad, as it recorded in the register of sexual attackers.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
The scheduled date of departure of the police must also be transmitted a week ago.
If the obligation to inform the authorities had been mentioned, it could be sentenced to five years.
The Kent police announced that they would not discuss the individual cases of Glitter's possible journeys after the period.
The Kent Police spoke: "Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to track someone who stays in Britain because we have extensive systems that deal with potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting Kent's inhabitants is the highest priority for the Kent Police and we are working closely to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual attackers to minimize any danger to the public."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was to fly to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities didn't let him pass passport checks and finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he fled back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials continued his return to Britain.
On 22 August, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and remained there, while his legal representative David Corker went to the Uxbridge lowest criminal court in Western London and at the same time successfully requested Scotland Yard to register as a sexual attacker.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the United Kingdom for the possession of child pornography for four months.
The source of the interior ministry said that Jacqui Smith, the interior minister, was calm and happy that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To catch the real character, I take a picture of the master outside the scene." Günther Bauer - photographer
No shoes, no calls, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenca, rejected from the focus on interpretation - I only aim at the free expression of men or women.
On the one hand, the artist.
Second, man.
Unsolved, if we remember private, in those moments far away from the audience - then we can see a reliable gesture, a deep summer of a captured view, or a passionate gesture with hands that are carefree, because they are not going to go out on stage.
German Günther Bauer is running the theatre of the "Flemenco-people" performance with musicians, dancers and guitarists with the less famous faces of the masters.
For this purpose, the photographer makes a unique iconography of flamenco from different environments.
The exhibition, which takes place within the month of the photography of Flamenca (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca), "represents the still growing international importance of Flamenca", says the author and explains that "Flemenco-people" "can be any person, but when you look at the photograph, you will find that these are not typical pictures of artists on stage.
These people's portraits "on the street" are artists able to carry on stage passion, sorrow, joy... and completely capture the viewers.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take a picture of the scene.
He's wearing his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the great flamens.
The famous festival "Cante de las Minas" began Bauer in 1997 a long way to portray flamence singers, guitarists and dancers on a disco camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, remind you of classical photography.
The application of different stylistic means is contrary to the classical basis of the image and lends it to the current spirit, which is the idea that Bauer himself shows and flamenco: "The music with very traditional roots, but it does not cease to surprise and develop."
What the spectators care about is not the performance of the dance itself, singing or playing, but the personality and character of the artist.
Looking for the moment when we meet with the most important, with the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and living, it was and is a constant work presented during these days in the gallery of El Fotomat.
This selection of nearly seventy photographers creates famous flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyosová, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales or Vicente Amigo.
The project became like a flamenca anthology and soon there will be a book edition that will contain exposed portraits.
The behavior for portraiting led Bauer to the idea to repeat the idea of "SportARTProject" on "Portrets of Sports Veterans".
Although their concept is different from "Flemenco-people", the photographer admits that "to photograph people, to recognize them and to have the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or just short, to enter their lives - that is my passion.
I think the portrait is the most difficult genre in the photograph.
A person meets or meets people, personalities that he never even knows or gives him just a few minutes to take a picture.
Despite a similar situation, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
A collection of portraits of the present flamenco called "Flemenco-people" is shown in the El Fotómat Gallery in the street of de la Mata 20, parallel to Alamedo de Hércules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel that writes is "truthality"
He is playing in an environment that he does not yet know, and reports on events for his strangers, although Mario Vargas Llosa plans to successfully implement his new project - he is working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in Congo for 20 years and traveled to Amazon.
The eternal favorite of the Nobel Prize for Literature yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia festival admitted that the project that employs him is "trouple", and that "everything suggests that I shouldn't write" this novel.
"If I could understand, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and believe that I will do it once," he composed his contribution to the Festival of Exchange of Ideas, Thoughts and Words, which he watched in the city for four days around hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people.
The author of the novel "City and Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third anniversary of the celebration of the word and fulfilled the expectation.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for the most popular writer - the old edition of Dickens' "Our Mutual Friend" - filled the theater Juan Bravo in the last place.
With Félix Rome, who introduced him, he had a dedicated audience before him, who spent an hour of time running like water - Perunec with remarkable accuracy and a remarkable dose of humor, remembered in him how from the original "incredulous adventure" of the "enjoyment of his readers" and from "the power to live more than I have lived" gave birth to literary transmission; how he submits "a lack of inspiration" by writing "disciplinedly", carefully arranged text, corrects and rewrites; or how his writings were affected by Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas and what "remind images" are the basis of his stories.
The Hispano American novelist admitted that "there is no way" how to find out if and to what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is just a fun, a touch experience" - stressed Vargas Llos by saying that he "is acting on people" and "the need is to try to forgive themselves from the ranks", and urged writers to "do not subject themselves to freedom" and "to take responsibility" of their mission.
Because of climate loss of fame in Pozoblanc - missing cups
The performance with cups that close the celebration in Pozoblanca was cancelled yesterday morning after a notification to the effectants that the surface of the site is not in good condition.
That is why the company, together with Fermin Bohorquez, Pable Hermos de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to end the race.
The adverse weather conditions of this celebration have long since failed two of the three festivals.
On Saturday, the rains made it impossible for the other planned bullfights to pass.
During their formation, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were to build bullies in the arena in Castilblanc.
But that's how it was only Friday.
The winner became Daniel Luque, who had three ears and a reward for dynamic and aesthetically high performance was cast on his shoulder.
On the same day of the afternoon, Alejandro Talavante changed two mornings for greetings and one ear that brought him more uncovered seats in the arena than toreador art.
Even worse, El Juli, who went through the race arena of Los Llanos in vain.
In the second round of the drain without a single breath, the majority of the obstetricians were very critical.
They took control in Álava in the delivery with two thousand kilograms of hash
In ten minutes, five.
Road control of Ertzintz in the urban district of Arminíón (Alava).
The trailers shall stop two persons driving in the supplier and they shall drive them.
The charge, more than two tons of hash, is not to be stopped.
According to the report of the Committee of the Interior of the Basque Government, the members of the Committee pursued and detained one of the persons driving in the supplier, men 38 years of age who were identified as A. A. J.
The detainee was accused of drug trafficking and of counterfeiting of state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out road checks on N-1 in places where the border of the city district of Armiñon is passing.
They were going to stop the delivery for control, but the driver didn't listen to the instructions, got speeded up and caught.
The car’s crew began to arrive immediately when the vehicle stopped at the edge a few miles away, at that time both passengers jumped up and fled to the forest.
Ertzaintzy’s followers finally captured one of them and played 2 178 kg of hash, which suspected they were surpassing, as appeared in the Iveco Daily’s delivery visit.
The latter part of the vehicle was loaded with the hash packages, which were subsequently transferred to other police departments for detailed expertise and drug weighing.
In addition, the police found that the badge was "sprayed" and did not agree with the data contained in the delivery documents, which was therefore also accused of counterfeiting of state documents.
Ertsaintza continues to search for a second suspect, who, as mentioned earlier, managed to escape to finally determine the origin of the drug.
The detained A. A. J., 28 years old, was transferred to the police department to arrange the appropriate formalities before joining the next investigation.
Herečka Heather Lockler is detained for driving under the influence of drugs
Herečka Heather Lockler, a favorite Amanda from the Melrose Place series, was detained this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
The Witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers when she tried to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, told the People magazine of California’s speakers on the road.
The witness explained that around 16.30 hours. Lockler's "pass walked on gas, drove forward and backward for sound drilling, and tried to get out of the parking lot - several times passing the sunglasses during cooking".
A Witness who didn't first know the actress saw Lockler just after he stopped at the distance and came out of the vehicle.
This person also warned the rescue service, because "she was afraid of Lockler's life."
When a police guard arrived at the scene, she found an actress inside a vehicle that partially blocked the vehicle.
"She looked disoriented," and therefore the members took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to test her.
According to the police spokesman, the actress cooperated and an excessive amount of alcohol was excluded, but "we believe Lockler was under the influence of some medications, which was visible to the officers at first sight".
Locklear was detained for suspicion of the effects of the next non-specified substance and was taken into custody at around 19.00, although she was released several hours later.
Two months ago Lockler returned from a treatment clinic where she was recovering from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists on the Andalusian IU Association to exercise its powers in the cause of Silva
Head of the IU and Member of the Joint Left Gaspar Llamazares today announced that the final decision in the case of the former Advisory Committee on Youth and Sport at Seville Francisc Manuel Silvy, who resigned from the office last week after being accused of dealing in the benefit of his family, will depend on the country association of the party.
"I am too federalist, it is for an Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares pointed out the deal, to which the party will have to step up in relation to the former member of the Civil City Council.
However, the Head of the IU insisted that in the case of the investigation of the illegal conduct permitted by Silva, "transparency" is absolutely necessary: "IU was always fighting for the maximum transparency of similar matters."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict ethical code for all public functions".
"Sangre de mayo', epic bet of Garci
José Luis Garci in the film "Sangre de Mayo" (Sangre de Mayo), to which he was inspired by Episodes of the National Past of Benita Pérez Galdóse, relives the famous rise of the Spaniards against the French - it is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "explain the character and analysis of the company", which he always admired in the famous novelist's work, explained today with Quim Gutiérrez and Paul Echevarría during the presentation of the image before the extensive team of interpreters.
The blood of May with metrace over two and a half hours will be put into movies this Friday and in the future more than a four-hour TV series for Telemadrid.
As a great admirer of Galdóse José Luis Garci's literary creation, he claimed to have fulfilled his "childish dream" by filming this film, thanks to Esperanza Aguiré, who, three years ago, entrusted him with filming at the Madrid Autonomous Province on 2 May, he accepted the offer that he would come from the National History Episode.
The budget of 15 million, to which the Madrid province has contributed entirely, means for Garcia "the only opportunity" to create an environment with scenes and costumes corresponding to the image of "the shaking of Spain, which was mistaken in the leadership for which it was going to fight - the fight for independence led to the fall of the governments of Ferdinand VII and the rest of the country," he stated.
The director, however, is sorry that he could not count on the financial support that he received from the films The sad wing (Ala sad) or Goy's ghosts - almost doubles the blood of May - so he could not draw some scenes from the script signed at the same time by Horace Valcarcel, with which he works almost throughout his film career.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver and Empesar) works as he is usually used to - on the scene with the actor who usually tries before the film and who does not choose to cast, because it seems to him to be "degrading" and he also believes that "part of the director's call is beyond going to theatres and movies and so to find out what's going on in the novel he's doing".
Many of the actors he chose for May's blood are already appearing in front of his camera several times, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larranñaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, with four nominations in Oscar, from which he won one, is of the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the flower blood itself, the seven tables of the French billaire and the last chosen blind sunglasses present a young generation of Spanish film scenes, but claims that "it will only appear".
Garci doesn't expect any credit for this movie.
"At first you think you're working for what's next, but then you realize that you're only working for the benefit, and then you're going to make another movie more," Garci explains with more than 30 years of director's career.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual link of Sevilla dancer Tortoly Valencia
Sevill dancer flamenca gives hold to other Sevill dancers.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of the father of Florence Tórtola Ferrer and the mother of Andalusanky (Georgina Valencia Valencia), was born in the quarter of Trian, and when she was three years old, she and her family moved to London.
She danced a modern dance and focused on an Oriental dance.
She lived a life full of passion, was the proponent of a woman's emancipation such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and was fighting for the abolition of a corset that made it impossible for women to move freely.
This woman's life influenced the dance and aesthetic revolution of the inter-war Europe Isabele Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepou Gamboa and she designed me this character - it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, it's not about telling her life, it's about grasping the soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the flamenco rhythm.
So, "song of the motila" has evocated my Guajira or "song of the snake" some kind of tanga.
Her dance was sensible and they told me that my dance of this aesthetic is also appropriate," she says.
The performance is calculated by involving two exceptional personalities: with Miguel Povedo, who will sing Isabele in one performance as in the "Open Doors" (La porta openta), and with the teacher of Matilde Coralova dance, who made an exception and joined in cooperation with her ex-girlfriend.
"Matilde represents an older Tortola, a mature character.
I'm glad she accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it's a great honor for me."
The performance also includes the music and guitars of Jesúse Torrese and Paca Arriagy, with the song of Miguel Ortegy, el Pulgy and Moi de Morón; drums El Pájara, the violin of Rafa El Violy and the co-operation of the artist Juanfry Juárez, "who has the role of the eternal guide of this kind of artist, who are primadons with all of them, and who are always in love with them".
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, who has been playing for her time in places such as India, the United States or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, because she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remind her, because I think she was one of those women who at some point have a huge influence, but no one knows her today and then less appreciates her creation," Bayón says.
The show starts today at 8:30 p.m. at Lope de Vegy.
The book "Christmas's Day" also closes the trienals
The introduction of the first illustrative edition of the "Denique of Christmas Married" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), at the place where Juan Ramón Jiménez closed his marriage with Zenobija in March 1916, is part of the programme coordinated by the Cultural Council of the autonomous Andalusian Government at the celebration of the "Trinales Zenobie and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the Year of Their Death.
"Triumnals of Zenobie and Juan Ramón" is about to end the new edition of this work, an international convention to be held in New York, the repair of the Nobel Museum House and the travel exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Onen Papsek Sun", which was opened in May of this year, and after lunching various Andalusian provinces, according to plans at the time of the congress, it should be moved to New York.
The cultural council of the autonomous Andalusian government also ordered eight sets of prints "Denique of freshly married" corrected by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue spreading awareness of the personality and part of one of the world's most famous Andalusian poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like himself that much anymore
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of the artist Sally Field, who worked with him on "Without a bad intention" and aware that Newman left, reveals his unsatisfying vision of abandoned American cinematography and the whole of America.
Look how long it took them to get Oscar.
And that he's been in retirement since 2007.
And that he knew he was very ill.
Even so, he was for all the boys.
"Sometimes what a person feels can't express in any way, and I've lost a big friend now," said in tears Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to him."
No one was afraid he'd be funny or he'd run.
He died the father of the film and the government, especially in the dark times of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American self-confidence is at the bottom of a desperate search for reasons of pride.
When time is harsh and people with no dignity and only a handful of those who are worthy of you - there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he was almost the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official supporter of Richard Nixon and the warrior for the lost and saved cases, from the drug addiction donation based on honor of the first-born son who died of overdose until after his own mark of domestic food and biofood.
A whole treasure for a country that has been a great effort to forgive itself from a self - sacrificing food culture.
The storm waves flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, found that not one man died, but one whole era.
Another Englishman, the holder of the Sam Mendes regime, said that working with Newman was the top of his career.
The evil boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, troufl Newman mark himself as his greatest source of inspiration.
"This fox has all set us up with a very high wing," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the little ones who today has the courage to try to live as Paul Newman's lived - based on honesty and leads a serious private life far from the camera.
It's not always easy, sometimes not even possible in today's media jungle.
But luckily such people are, and Paul Newman is their model.
He divorced once, and since then he has been married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who has been faithful, although the dozacist had more than enough opportunities to be.
"Why would I go out to the hamburger when I'm home filett?" I'd like to joke.
Let him be proud in the heavens that he shall rule upon earth the bond between his daughters and his admirers - in America it is not too common.
It is said that "from all the great roles that he performed, he was the most proud of the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather and a philanthropist."
Unperfect races of the Madrid Olympics
Yes, many of us long for the Olympics to take place in Madrid, and after the unscrupulous year 2012 it will be possible 2016.
But I'm asking, are we ready?
If we run a race yesterday, I say no!
He was talking about him as a perfect race, and according to my judgment, he was the worst I've ever been on.
Such a dream of mindlessness, that as soon as it came to an evaluation and I was a tester, it would be clearly insufficient.
But let's take a look at it from the beginning, pretty one after the other.
Idiots begin by picking up a racing number, which is why a person has to get out early.
I don't think it's bad, but when a man goes there, they give him everything (including the chip that should avoid overcrowding the road).
Oh, no.
Here a man had to pick up the number first (first nonsense, go there only because of it) and (after a corresponding front) - what a surprise! - they had only a trick size S (second nonsense, because I need size XL).
Where do we live?
That's because of the crisis they decided to buy just a little shirt because it's less substances and they're cheaper?
Okay, well, that's a small thing compared to what was done on the day of the race.
Besides that it had to go very soon for the chip and the front it took over 15 minutes, he had to take the bag back there.
It lasted 35 minutes waiting time, which is at the race, where 11,000 people are expected, something incomprehensible.
So, as expected, the race started, and we haven't put up with the drums yet, and when it happened, the pickup was much worse.
The waiting also lasted 40 minutes of rain, leading to a general riot and an attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have to fire the pipeline tomorrow and some of us, like me, will not see the right time to evaluate the results for the chip that they gave me and which, I suppose, did not record the right time to start.
Of course, if someone asked me about some perfect race, I wouldn't think of this.
And so I think we're going to have to let the well-prepared Olympic city go.
Microsoft is looking for reception (virtual)
At the conference on new technologies, Microsoft presented further developments in the new system of image recognition and human interaction in the way of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but able to perform basic tasks such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger who would move around the entire area of society) and doing what he heard in the conversation.
Thanks to the camera and the system that recognizes the shapes and faces, this "receptive" can determine how many people are in the room who - even remember what they have on themselves - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
It can also classify the present by the conversion groups.
In the demonstration video, the reception records a third person and understands that he is not part of the group he is talking to, and that he is not an employee of the company.
She asks if she's going after someone and tells her she's going to be committed in a moment.
That's all without the blue screen of death.
That's amazing.
But of course it's the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things at work, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week, there was a lot of talk about changing Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be easier and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers had only the most necessary, without the burden of commercial remains, they would be five times more efficient -- man, Steve, they would be cheaper.
Discover as a noise when we consider that Microsoft version adds a new function to Windows and another "extra".
Changing the direction would be a worthy act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system loses its importance slowly and is similar to the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who adhered to the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary level for understanding between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your ears.
That's right.
It never disappears, but there is a need to think about the "death" of the operating system, not as an absolute truth, but as a relative to the truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system and, on the contrary, to more internet browsers.
The computer is turned on to trigger Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time on the Internet than around windows.
What are half of the applications that run the system for?
There's less.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
Zoufale needs it, and here's a little example.
I took this photograph in one of the restrooms for Microsoft's employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the connector that asked them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week with the exception confirmed the delay of a new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It won't come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's count to 2010.
In Microsoft they will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone's becoming more and more computer.
Given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay for the delay of the charge.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried him on the Azuro coast, Leonardo di Caprio in one of the "Breed Diamond" Edward Zwicka, as well as Al Pacino in the "Kmotro" Francise Ford Coppoly, and is also part of the uniformly svalated gay community.
And if we want to count his life roles, we can sink into the image of a typical slum with a tip, which lifts the femurs in a cat circus.
It's basically nothing more than a typical cotton-dolled pantyhose, flexible and with no hands.
English speakers call him 'tank', but only Fabuleus Marcel from Brussels wins over all the others.
For the first time in his name -- even when people call him 'Marcel' -- which is related to sport, because, according to the legend, it was named after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out above other quality cotton, unisex shirt, different by label and (almost unknown) Belgian flag, which have models of non-immblematic fabrics as a detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the Belgian company is not specializing only on the tank tops.
It also manufactures mini colleges, retro boxers, cashmere sweats, cotton pants, marine shirts, clothes for children, mini shirts...
Thoughtful pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother.
Her sister’s tremendous image did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz, though small, is a woman full of life.
Their new fashion activities are now taking Cruz's sisters very seriously.
For Monica, it means a lot more than just that some nice, famous girls will ring their names.
In Paris, the promotion campaign organized by Mango in its new home was attended, as well as the declaration of the most important fashion prices that this Spanish company sponsors.
She's heartless and she's getting close to you.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to introduce the new collection that Sister Penélope proposed for Mango this autumn-winter season, and at the same time I attended the second year's Mango Fashion Awards and dinner in Opera for Valentine's Day.
So it was a challenging but exciting day at the same time.
What's your new collection for Mango that you've been working for since the fourth season?
My sister and I love movies from the '50s and '60s, and we've been throwing lots of incentives out of them.
I also love to wander around the city and watch women walk dressed, combine and tear their clothes, I do it very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, but at the end of the day, everything is connected and has a lot of connections.
I must have liked the clothes, I still wanted to go to my grandmother's, talk in my aunt's closets and look at her clothes.
It was a sensation, almost better than going on a walk.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to watch my dress.
However, you know that we dancers are relying on how we're adjusted to feel good at our hours and tests in view of the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, you're really going to get into the stage.
So everything is connected, of course with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You've just been 30, you've been hit by a crisis?
Oh, my God.
I'm feeling better than ever before, I'm having fun.
I find that a woman is already ready, has experience, and lives enjoy less mistakes.
Biological hours don't scare me.
I do what I want, and it gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course I know I'm gonna be a mother because my body wants it, and besides, I want to be a young mom, I don't want to miss it.
As for my father, I'm not worried about it.
But one thing I know for sure, I will give my child a sense of happiness and I will bring him up with great love.
As far as the film is concerned, there are now a couple of movie premieres you made last year.
It's like that, and I'm looking forward to it when they come to the movies.
I come from a theater world, and so I'm very impatient and restless, I want everything right now, and of course it's not going to work.
I look forward to the premiere "The Last Hour" and "In Search of the tomb of Christ".
Just as you're gonna like them...
A few days ago, you had your premier on a screening mill on Naomi Campbell's side, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to stand on the floor like a model.
She only called me Naomi Campbell, who has known me for a long time, and invited me to London to participate in the benefit reviews for her organization "Woman for a Better Life", and the clothes we had - I selected two models from our collection for Mango - and the award was handed over to this NGO.
People don't know Naomi has such a good heart.
She's talking about a lot of things, and I, because I know her, can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'm gonna stick to the good thing he's engaged in.
She asked me to make a show for charity, but if she asked me to make a stand, I'd do it too.
In the interests of the third world's women, I'll do what I need.
Repeated arrival drivers with alcohol in their blood will have to install "alcohol"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that a driver with three administrative sanctions under the influence of alcohol must install in his vehicle a system that prevents him from starting a car in a state of drunkenness or if he suddenly starts.
The proposal has already become known in June of this year and is now included in the Annual Report of the Supreme State Representative, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its aim is to return the drivers to the wheel, so the drivers will also have to complete the overload course.
This experience will be shared by the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Office of the Technical Institute for Vehicle Safety (FITSA).
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 % of motorists charged more than once for the treatment of alcohol again in this condition will be used as a wheel.
Alcolock should prevent this because it is a system connected to a vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the air and prohibits starting the car if the driver is previously inactive or if it is marked higher than the permitted concentration of alcohol.
His price exceeds 1,000 euros and he'd have to pay it himself.
The study carried out in this sense in the USA in 2007 showed that in the first year of introduction, the vehicles equipped with this device had reduced the infringement by 65 %.
In Spain it is calculated that every year it could save 115 people.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to resolve this behaviour before it is committed in a criminal act.
And in order to help introduce it, since legal correction can be carried out in a normal way, the necessary correction of criminal provisions requires a change of law.
The equipment is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, even though some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles have already been tested.
Just tomorrow the Congress will vote on the proposal of the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) recommending the installation of this system on school buses, as in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British accuracy, at 17.40 a.m., as was the case in the program, a Spanish air force aircraft arrived in the presidential hangar at Benita Juárez Airport in Mexico D. F., where the Prince and Princess of Asturias arrived.
The sun had just come to light, but his paprikas so far forced him to close his eyes so that we could see the next couple coming out of the plane.
There were Spanish ambassadors and other officials under the umbrella.
A few hours ago, I asked the taxi driver if he knew that the Spanish prince with the princess was coming to the state visit.
- Yeah, so that's great, it won't be able to get people to pick up at the airport... she's from here or something...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, well...
However, the Mexican press well knows who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport just at the red deck and the military cordon, which consists of 27 marine soldiers prepared to fire an honest rescue.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a suit of dark blue color and princess, very neatly dressed and with hair torn, he does not have his usual "peeptoes", apparently reported to her that in D. F. he threatens the storm.
Before they go to the hall where the official delegation is waiting, they smile at the photographers and order them without any obligation.
At the doors of the hotel, where they will be accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, there is a Mexican TV reporter named after them.
Best available fashion price
There's probably no better place in the world to declare fashion prices than Paris and there's probably no more significant designer and bonused than Valentino.
Mango has just issued the second year of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to allow the international presentation of new talent in fashion.
The price is EUR 300,000.
Belgian Sandrina Fasoliová, winner of the first year, last night looked at her proposals in Manga's Exhibit on the Paris bubble number 54 and almost cried with touch.
Of course, it is the second largest trade of this company in Europe and has just been opened at 1,335 square meters.
The biggest one is in London.
Many events together with the desire to thank the designer Valentina for taking over the presidency of the competition jury led us to finally have an overdraft dinner in Paris's Opera Garnier.
Mango's famously decorated Presidential Table appeared next to the most significant Chagall works even more wonderful.
Nata, who, with her heart broken because of her brother’s recent death, did not reveal anything, wore the garments of this brand and the spices of ELAH, over which she hid her breath, and hung on to her son, Luise, almost two feet [2 m] in elegance, accompanied Valentina in the front of the table at dinner to his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, took a welcome and, as a real gentleman, stayed with Baron Rothschild without a jacket, because they offered them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who arrived at the store in - manually designed - pants and shirts and turned into long black dresses for dinner, took a night walk after the opera following Goyi Toledov, showed us the ballet test room, and while remembering other times, she caught one of the dots and marked the "grand floor".
Inés Sastre's house didn't stay on the side of the building, but she showed us her son's pictures on the mobile phone before leaving.
The next morning we were able to love the presence of Oliver Martínez - another young man who rides on a motorbike - and John Travolty, who came to the Paris Intercontinental hotel with his own clothes and towels and first asked not to be used in his rooms.
Stars under the starry Paris sky.
Oh there, it's life.
1001 - Stress number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget about chaotic and angry everyday life.
And in order not to be too short, all are summarized in one book that will lead to the bookstore relaxation on September 30th.
The alarm rings every morning at 7 o'clock as a punishment, but even worse is to imagine yourself trapped in a successful rhythm that brings the present life.
The office is called tension and computer pain back.
Stress is the disease of the 21st century.
However, there is no one, no two methods of fighting daily exhausting and problems getting rid of the world of work.
No, it's nothing bigger than that number and nothing less than 1001.
Susannah Marriott, outside of the yoga position, classical massages and "spa" therapy on her books, gathered all the "menu" options adjusted according to the taste and time options of each individual.
The book of protests is called "1001 ways of relaxation" and thanks to the loading of Pearson Alhambra and DK will bring peace to the bookstore.
If anyone thinks that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as work or personal relationships, "handbook" rejects this view.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you don't have adrenaline in your veins, which rebalances in your body, and stress becomes a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, turn off and focus on reading.
Sleeping Speech
Some kids talk at night.
I don't think those who wake up and the kids tell us something that happened the day before, but the kids who talk while they sleep.
If it happens first, it may cure you, but it's really insignificant.
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somniloquie.
She's very common, especially with children and young people.
Of course, one of you was told that he was talking about sleeping at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadic (e.g. once a lifetime at high temperatures), or with more regularity (every day, once a week, once a few months...), the second day the child does not remember anything.
There is not only one reason to explain her attitude.
Often it is associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night rage, night enuresis (night care) or moonlight, but it doesn't have to be that way.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fevers, stress, or anxiety.
In any case, it's a bit of a tricky phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or just the opposite (screaming, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where it appears with great strength, it would be appropriate for a child to observe and consult the expert to see if there is any problem that causes him great anxiety and thus occurs.
We said that it is a harmless disorder, so it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (e.g. if it is eaten with apnea syndrome or with permanent stress).
However, we can do this by keeping in mind a number of very simple preventive measures, such as:
Try not to upset the child too much before he goes to sleep.
So watch quiet games and avoid violent or violent TV programs or shows.
In very nervous children and those who are given the job to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner peace.
The child will make it easier to sleep.
When a somniloquie appears, try to stay calm.
Remember, she's harmless to the child and she won't remember anything from what she did the next day.
Useful tips
Don't be him.
It's unnecessary because he's not aware and you're interrupting his sleep.
Even when he speaks, he sleeps, and then he rests.
Keep in mind that if you feel that you have a lot of pain, it would be good to seek advice or find out what causes such anxiety in your child.
If you understand what he says (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to interrogate him and draw information from him.
It won't do anything, because when he's sleeping, he's not aware that he can arrange his thoughts.
Besides, you can hear what he says, but you don't know what he thinks, and then why he says it, so be careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you come up with.
Never tell your child that you can ask him about his secret at night.
Not for fun.
That's causing a lot of anxiety.
Don't worry about it, it's nothing wrong, it's just an episode that takes just a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way to victory again after a long silence.
Without a major match, the yellows created more chances and managed to change one of them victoriously.
The game did not have too fast a pace during this shooting, in which attackers were making it difficult.
After the first attempt by the captain of Kauffmann's host, who was shot from a distance only by the hair of the last joint, began to have Illhaeusern light surface and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne air, Romain on a long foot or also Diebold gradually came to seek protection Dannemarie.
On the contrary, the opponent built a defensive wave in the middle of the game and left only agile Riahhi on the edge of the attack.
The beginning of the second half proved to be decisive, and first thanks to the two chances Dannemarie named Riahi and Temporale, then after the opening of the score for Illhaeusern, who took care of Marais, well located for the processing of the ball reflected in the previous Diebold attempt (53').
Golman Illhaeuserna, however, was not happy for a long time; after about twelve minutes, he was forced to return to the closet and leave his associates so weakened.
Dannemarie, however, failed to cope with this and the eleven from Illhaeusern, who was just a little tired of "suffering" the defense, no longer causing any major difficulties, with the exception of the very last seconds of the battle, when the sword had flown very close to the edge after a great confusion.
Sarkozy is going to blow up angry fishermen.
Before leaving the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a ride across Britain.
To face the demonstration of the forces of fishermen who broke the access of several British and Nordic ports on Monday, the French President decided to go to the Guilvinec port in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The last appointments promised to accept "in a constructive spirit", and hope that "will come with concrete proposals".
The President's visit comes at the same time as a valid meeting of the "crisis committee" created by Breton fishermen with a view to obtaining measures against the rapid increase in oil prices, which reached a peak of EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the spokesperson of the Elyse Palace David Martinon, the president "will talk about solutions that can be presented in an effort to help their companies to regain competitiveness and better ensure the conditions of employment and the payment of seafarers".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to fish with infallibility.
On Tuesday morning, they performed the operation of "lumbar" (slow driving vehicles) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing a smooth 10km of traffic jam.
The recreational port in Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections towards Belle-île were not interrupted.
A filter override was performed on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors showed their determination already on Monday, when, immediately before the stockpiles of fuel in the ports in Brest and Lorient, the tires and pallets were burning, while in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc there were demonstrations.
The movement extended to other ports on the Atlantic coast and to the La Manche canal, as to Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where the voyages remained in the port, or to Le Havru, where about 20 vessels blocked the operation of commercial ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantic area during the evening stopped the blockade of important refineries Total in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until they decide to act themselves until the mid-term meeting at the Ministry.
In Guilvinec, on Tuesday, the "crisis committee" will decide on how to proceed on the way, and on its participation in the preparatory meeting of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the State Fisheries Committee who did not support their movements.
"The situation will continue" because "fishers will not allow anything" and "do not want to go to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, president of the Fisheries Committee in Lorient.
However, fishermen who do not pay oil tax currently pay about 50 cents per litre, judging that the ship's efficiency threshold is reached only when it is oil below 0,30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman
The unforgettable representative "Butche Cassidy and Kida" died as a result of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes also presented the legend of a film and a politically engaged actor Paul Newman who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery requirements for 2008
Brazil’s aircraft manufacturer relies this year on the delivery of 215 aircraft, despite the threat of recession that is rising above the world economy.
The fourth aircraft designer in the world, Embraer, maintains his delivery requirements for 2008 with 215 devices added, confirmed his president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer added 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian constructer promises a lot from the Chinese market, especially on the scale of its 30 to 120 seats.
To this day Embraer has added 41 devices to Chinese customers within eight years.
AIG takes into account 15 % of its assets
The insurer of the American International Group, whose US money offices have been given over water, considers that he would spend more than 15 % of his assets in order to pay 85 billion dollars that were given to him as a deposit, writes the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is prepared to examine the sale of most of its activities outside of life insurance in the international field and income activities in the United States, clarifying a diary that cites the sources close to the ongoing process.
According to FT, the AIG Board met on Sunday during the evening to investigate possible behaviour.
It was not possible to obtain any confirmatory declaration from the AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to dispose of include its International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the security provider Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its portfolio of properties and investments in private equity, provides FT.
No final decisions on these positions have been taken so far, FT continues.
The AIG must quickly obtain cash so that it can repay the loan of 85 billion, which has been granted to the Federal Reserve Bank, with the risk that the US authorities will entertain 80 % of the capital, while also distributing the shareholding ratio of the current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of the historic meeting Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historical decline on Monday after the November representatives rejected Paulson's plan to save the bank: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, which is unknown losses approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has fallen by 777.68 points to 10 365.45 points.
The biggest current point failure in its history (about 684.81) was recorded on September 17, 2001, on the day of the renewal of the post-terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
The Nasdaq index with the dominant technological component lost, according to definitive data after the end of the trade, 199,61 points and was set at 1,983,73 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8,81 % (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1, 106,55 points.
Since the beginning of the session, Wall Street has literally failed after an unexpected rejection of the plan to save the Bank of Snow Representatives, a plan that should allow for a little stability to be found on the markets again.
228 votes against and 205 for representatives refused to provide the Secretary of State with the funds he requested to Henry Paulson.
The homeless two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
"It is a bad signal sent to the market, which sees that Congress is unable to adopt a plan," Lindsey Piegza from the FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added and expressed concern that the project adopted in a few days did not come "too late".
"If this project is indeed doomed to failure (...), the staff will be handed over immediately to Fed (the US Central Bank, as it were) and to other central banks in order to welcome the crisis, which would further strengthen the credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, the head of the Global Insight economy.
And with emphasis on the urgency of the situation in the United States, Piegza has stated that "every new day brings down one financial institution".
After Friday's crash, Washington Mutual organized the bank's bank's banking rebate by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly turned around and has requested immediate intervention in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which indicates that markets are not "only in the US crisis, but in the world crisis", an analyst from FTN Financial added.
The bond market has come to a standstill.
The yield from the 10-year inventory decreased by 3,632 % against 3,827 % on Friday night, the yield by 30 years to 4,161 % against 4,357 % on the previous day.
Obama won points in the first television duel
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House, the second debate followed, which tasked to find out which of the two John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The leaders of the campaign of Republicans and Democrats were not surprised when both declared their victory in the television duel, which followed a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, however decent, was not "brilant" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential elections, down in the polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion survey published on Saturday, allocates to Obama a five-point drive (49% versus 44% for McCain), considers that the Democrats are the winner of the duel.
Among the undecided voters on which it is concerned, Obama is the winner of 39% of the respondents, while, according to the CBS survey, 25% allocates victory to McCain.
Both should be able to confirm their leadership on Thursday by means of the expected good performance of their joint candidate Joseph Biden, during the first and at the same time the only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's given up," said Bill Clinton on the weekend.
Seventy-one McCain has consistently raised his unassuming experience in the field of foreign policy, while at the same time stressing the "Navigity" of his rival in the issues that created the core of the first encounter.
"It seems that Senator Obama didn't understand that..." was a repeated accusation.
"I don't think Senator Obama would have enough experience and knowledge to become president," he said.
In such an aggressive spirit, yesterday’s Republican television shows took place.
On the contrary, both stressed that it was a future.
He didn't lose his head, and he turned out to be a careful and accurate person.
He has strengthened his ability to make the right decision and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain still did not understand, while Obama did," he said about the weekend democratic event that tells the Republicans that it is not enough to take into account the impact of the crisis on the "common American".
"During the 90-minute debate of this John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered at the pre-election meeting in North Carolina for rain.
He did not even say words like "middle class" or "worker". The financial breakdown clearly benefits Obama, whom the Americans consider to be more capable of saving the economy on the brink of ruin.
"Next week a decisive return could occur," the influential democratic Senator Charles Schumer guessed yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, former member of Clinton's administration, compared Obama to what Bill Clinton had during the financial crisis in 1998.
For the candidate of the Democrats, the current grave is "the ultimate verdict of eight-year-old poor economic policy, how George Bush operated it and how Senator McCain supported it".
The Senator of Illinois once again confirmed that through unexpected jumps to Wall Street, he should be able to reduce the taxes of 95% of Americans, and also noted that the realization of any country's energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy sources is his priority number one, together with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates have carefully avoided questions regarding the financial assistance plan of 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), which was adopted by Congress last night and which is highly unpopular.
"What, did you notice that there were any elections in Minsk?"
Young people and regime opponents demonstrated Sunday night at the main square of the Belarusian capital to deny the results of the parliamentary elections.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evenings following the closing of the elections at the main square in Minsk to protest against the irregularity of the elections to parliament.
Although no results have been reported so far, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenko's regime: "dictator, demise".
Some admit that they didn't even say to the election, "What would it be like if they did what they wanted to do with my voice," says one young man.
They do not believe that this regime, which has been acting in favour of foreign observers with a view to re-establishing the European Union, would be ready to move towards democracy.
Penalties, including the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian sexes and the freezing of certain assets, could be abolished if the elections were considered clean by observers.
It wasn't like that, according to the opposition.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers should not participate in the counting of votes," Juri Potümkin, spokesperson of the Union of Democratic Forces, attended the various 12-party groupings.
"This is about a cosmetic change," stressed Alexandr Milinkievič, the former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections and the leading personality of the pro-European movement, "because it is essential that we calculate the votes, and we have the power to do so.
If some opposition MPs get to parliament, they will be appointed, and never elected.
However, their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in regions and legislative proposals."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to take part in political action, because "a dialogue with the European Union needs to be started.
Since our economy, which is deeply indebted to Russia, is going to be a crisis and we are not reforming, it threatens us to become Russia's protector.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is afraid that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the course of the elections, will not declare the elections to be valid.
It underlines that participation appears to be too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26 % of the vote in Minsk) has opened the way with all possible manipulations.
"What, did you notice that there were any elections?" says social-democratic leader Alexandr Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
"There was no foot in the election rooms.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, those most eligible."
The night's silence was echoed again in the October square.
On TV, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission are blessing their success.
Conversation - Blood That Is Safe Again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the tenth anniversary of the establishment and his president, Dr. Francine Décary, was rightly pleased because Hema-Quebec became one of the most reliable and inefficient blood suppliers in the world.
First of all, he regained the trust of the public, who was seriously disturbed after a scandal with contaminated blood in the 1980 ’ s and 1990 ’ s.
As is generally known, the State reserve of blood administered by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Committee was contaminated during the 1980s by an immune deficiency (HIV) and a C-type hepatitis virus.
In view of this drama and the wave of unrest of the public, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation in February 1994 by Judge Horace Krever to explain the circumstances leading to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a loss can no longer be recovered.
While Judge Krever left the report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new system of blood management in Canada.
In Quebec, the Géline's committee was set up.
According to the report by Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers were established in Canada: Hema-Québec, which was to be owned by Quebec, and the Canadian blood company for the storage of all provinces and both territories.
"When Hema-Quebec started his activities in 1998, almost 38% of people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system," Dr. Décary recalls.
"The situation was overwhelming.
In a consistent effort to increase the safety of blood products and the continued work in this area over the years, we have regained public confidence," he says and proudly adds that by the beginning of 2008 Hema-Québec had already believed 94% of the Quebec population.
Dr. Décary, however, does not lose sight of the fact that "trust is very fragile."
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998 Hema-Québec has applied the principle of caution.
"At that time we witnessed in Europe the presence of many human cases of crazy cow disease, new variants of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease," the woman, who has been leading the company since her founding in 1998.
"And we didn't know if this disease could spread blood.
Therefore, we have relied on one of the basic recommendations of Krever and Gélineau's report, according to which in the event that we do not know, and in the event that there is a serious disease at stake, in this case, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which constitutes the degeneration of the brain which inevitably leads to death, must be taken by an exclusive measure.
Thus, in April 1999, we refused to accept blood from people who stayed in the United Kingdom for a period of more than one month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proven that this disease was transmitted to the blood.
So this episode showed us that keeping the principle of caution made sense."
In 1999 much more accurate HIV detection techniques were found on the market: tests using nucleic acid (NAT) that enable the presence of the virus itself directly in donor blood, rather than the presence of antibodies on which tests were used previously.
NAT tests have allowed short periods of noise between the patient's infection and the moment our blood technology can be detected, explains the specialist.
We've been able to shorten this period for less than a week.
We have thus significantly reduced the risk that some donors might be infected without knowing about it and without getting to know it.
This improvement has significantly reduced the risk of getting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
The risk of getting the blood contaminated by HIV is now exposed to one of the 12 million people.
"In other words, it means that before someone gets HIV, 12 million blood products will have to be distributed.
In view of this, Hema-Québec distributes between 400 000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take 24 years before the first case of transmission of HIV through the blood product appears.
I believe that today we can get or prescribe a blood transfusion that is necessary for healing," says Head of Hema-Quebek.
"The challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what pathogen may appear in the system.
Just last year, on the island of Réunion, the Chikungunya virus was found, which, like the West Nile virus, transmits to the blood by stabbing the tissue.
It is necessary to be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Décary, stressing that, in addition to safe storage, Hema-Québec must also be counted with sufficient storage.
"They need to grow, because the population will grow old.
As a result of more aggressive treatment of cancer, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which averages only 3% of Quebecans eligible for donation."
Every healthy person at least 18 years old, meeting the eligibility criteria, but can donate blood only once in 56 days, that means six times a year.
14 % of the people offering blood are not accepted on average because they are AIDS carriers or malaria, for example, and if they visited the country where the bathing cold is running, they are excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3% we can maintain a condition that meets the needs of hospitals.
The deficiencies are very rare.
However, members of the donor network need to supplement the extent to which they are old and are no longer able to donate blood.
But to convince people to give blood is difficult, especially to keep and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so unsatisfied today that we can only find an hour to give our blood," Francine Décary said.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart palate, eye bubbles and skin, which is used almost exclusively for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank from the Québec dome.
The apocalyptic cord, previously considered biomedical waste, pours blood rich into stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousands of blood sample from the bees to the bank and we assume that we will take them over a thousand years.
At the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplantation," explains Dr. Décary, who describes the blood collection program from the spider's breast as very popular.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they have no access to it," because Hema-Québec does not have enough resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in semi-finals
The impact of Montreal yesterday at the stadium of Saputo during the second and at the same time deciding the quarter-final match played on the total number of tracks qualified for the semi-final round of the first USL division, thanks to win 3:1 (4:3 is the goal balance after both matches) over the Sounders from Seattle.
Lieutenant Antonio Ribeiro gave the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the two-legged first half, David Texto and Rocco Plancentino, the remaining two angles of visual formation, were inserted.
Roger Levesque was the only one who was able to consult Matt Jordan for the sake of the Sounders.
Remember, during the first of two quarter-final matches on Friday, the impact on Starfire Complex in Tukwile at Seattle Battle 2-1.
The impact will measure its power in the semi-finals with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder settled in a home-run deficit 3:1 and finally won 4:3, however, Whitecaps went into a semi-final round with a total number of tracks 5:4.
The impact should be met with Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series of matches will be confirmed to this day.
Short - Kovalev's winning goal
The first three Canadian attacks are ready to start the season.
The unit made up of Alexe Kovalev, Tomáš Plekance and Andreje Kosticina last night at the Centre Bell prompted an attack on the victory of the Canadians 3:2 for independent rides.
Kosticin, the biggest shooting star, shot the goal, the Plekanec collected two assistances, and Kovalev staged a recording in this fourth victory of three-coloured six preparatory battles.
Kovalev secured the victory by giving a single goal during the solo rides.
"I'm not ready yet," warned Russia.
"I need another fight to feel good."
"In the first third, he tried to manage too many," noted Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the fight.
He had a nice smile."
Charest settles to the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out that by the end of the year the preliminary election will take place
Immediately after the end of the Liberal Party (Party Liberal), Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduk (left) is running for the complementary elections today.
"Delineate between our last big northern border": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visual fashion at the conclusion of the assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Lévis, but did not tell the details.
During his speech, images were projected behind his back in a painting mill.
On three curved plates, a slide with remarkable images of hydroelectric transformers, down, Québec from the view of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great resources, like in the pre-election period.
At the press conference, the other prime minister refused to exclude him from holding early elections in the autumn, even though he pointed out that he had a very busy programme.
"North Plan" is the fourth dimension of "vision", which the prime minister intends for Quebec, a vision of "new economic space", which includes an agreement with France on labour force, an agreement between Canada and Europe and an agreement with Ontario.
Although the opening of the North - Northern Territory at the 49th Equinox - the Prime Minister has recently often mentioned in his statements, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North represents a "big-potential curse", but did not specify the time, amount of investment, nor a clear priority in future projects.
He mentioned a number of approaches to the points that could be further broken down: in particular water plants, forests, especially the arduous sector, motivated by rapid growth in developing countries and the renewal of public infrastructure.
North, according to Charest's account, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "territory twice as much as France is with us", "is in Quebec.
And he's not just with us, but he's in us," he stressed, as if he wanted to show that he's calling for some national foundation mint.
Quebec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, the prime minister raised: the gold honor in Abitib, Québec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after he turned off the theater to look at a huge map behind his back.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes the part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded, clarified the prime minister during the press conference.
"It is a traditional attitude that has repeated all the governments of today.
There is one border line that no longer exists, and if an opportunity arises, on behalf of the government, this position will be taken again," he pointed out.
Otherwise, "in relation to climate change, we also need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, when he spoke of a transition north-west, which will open every year as a result of ice-cream.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that taking over the territory becomes an obligation.
And what about the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létoureau (former Pakistani member of Hungary), had already started negotiations with about thirty communities.
The action was initiated by the Interministerial Committee, chaired by Mr Benoît Pelletier, and has an important position by Julie Bouletová (Transport and Natural Resources).
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, "not necessarily summit", but a moment when "a common vision will be deleted".
The development of the North should continue in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "jointly designed, structured and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "visus" as a gash that was linked to the liberal prime minister's vision that preceded him.
"Like the liberals who have preceded us, we have changed our minds to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was still one of the still interrupted theme of the weekend, which was launched on Friday by a large cocktail raising the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage in front of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to cross the Beauharnois Centre at the Adélard-Godbout override.
"From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, through Lesage, who carried out the Little Revolution and nationwide water power, until after Borass, who created James' Bay, proved our party to create the future," said Jean Charest.
At the press conference, he turned to another authority, this time conservative, and even on the program "Roads to the North" John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
When a row came to the Eastmain1a-Ruper pipeline, Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I'm just saying this between us, but I'm planning to be on it," he said to his Member's basics, which caused considerable relief.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and no doubt even in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of holding elections in the autumn of this year, which enables him to do so.
However, he stressed that his program is busy, especially missions to the federal council in China and the Québec-New York Summit.
The weekend convention provided the leader of the Liberal platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular "the efforts to change the constitution", which last very hard: PLQ (Liberal party of Québec) requires in particular recognition of the "specificities of Québec" in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint part of the members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Television Council, who should have the right to veto in the event of decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the North Plan was adopted skeptically in its main features.
Chief of PQ (Party Québec) Pauline Marois again withdrew the Québec North Development Policy, which the Landry government had released in 2001.
According to it, when the Liberals' government came to power in 2003, it failed to implement this policy.
If she would hold on to it, "we would be going on today," Marois noted on the side of her candidates in Jean-Talon (where elections are taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
ADQ said they would support the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
"But we accept that it is not just a theatre," explained Sébastien Proulx, a leader representing Maria Dumont, who is returning from the holidays today.
Letters - Disadvantaged countries
It was Vic Toews, former minister of justice (on irony) in Harper's office, who allowed himself to say last summer about Louise Arbour that he represents "hangba" for Canada.
So subjugated a woman who has waged an irrefutable battle for justice and who deserves all our admiration, it tells a lot about the Prime Minister's environment and Stephen Harper alone.
We have a government that, as one of all the participating Western countries, has not returned to the state of its state-owned member of the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not at all consider that at the time of his execution, Omar Khadr was a young teenager.
The only government that, although Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, has been renouncing its words and allowing it to rot under the conditions of a child soldier.
The only one who relies on the parody of justice to judge the guilty.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and, in particular, the Association of Canadian Lawyers, are defending the repatriation of Omara Khadra so that there can be a fair trial in Canada.
The government closes its eyes before torture: it doesn’t care that this young man is first psychologically destroyed, and this has undoubtedly lasted, after so many years of printing.
We are not aware of this, but we are just witnesses to the narrow erosion of our rights, our freedoms and our "democracy", the words that Harper is so concerned about and which from his mouth sounds so empty.
The time has come when there is no more morals: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, treat him badly, arrest him according to the chief's libel until the minority government (as it will be after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation on the side that declares Honor, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has denied what has created the reputation and seriousness of our country.
Hanba is, Mr. Toews, in this denial, not elsewhere.
Opinions - Orwell's speech by Barrick Gold
In the September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Executive Vice President of the Canadian Labour Company Barrick Gold.
With Orwell's logic, it confirms that the world's largest gold producer has initiated the arrival of three authors and a poor small burdenload for insulting honors with the aim of calling for a "transparent public debate" and demanding six million.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of a breach of honor, but the law.
It's not surprising that Garver is completely out of the question.
Or is it for Barrick Gold the best way to lead a public debate, to bring anyone who dares to take a different position?
Whatever the case may be, the authors and publisher of the book Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend a considerable amount of money to be prepared to fight and fight in a very unbalanced fight with the army of lawyers supported by almost no-good work-bodies.
The tactics in these unbalanced fights are often associated with the destruction of the defendants in order to bring about peaceful proceedings that will silence the face of the opposite and also frighten anyone who dares to commit this thing.
If Barrick Gold really wanted to have a public debate, she had her views on the whole thing to represent the public opinion.
In contrast to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold acts, there is a debate on normal circumstances in the exchange of ideas, and not in the shoe wounds.
Therefore, the aim of the company was not to open its books, its documentation and conduct a real debate through news, media, publication and funding of independent scientific teams that could bring light to the whole thing.
Barrick Gold, however, seems to have no confidence in public opinion, and is reluctant to reject petitions and letters in support of the authors of the book Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he could demand "public debate", and at the same time reject opinions from the public?
It seems that this word in the Vice-President's world refers only to a purely paid lawyer, not to all Canadians; it is a rather narrow concept of this concept.
In democracy, they have the right to speak also to the nativityists.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so primarily because it rejects brutal ways of doing business.
The public is prepared to hear and assess the matter, but on the basis of civilised exchange of arguments, not within what many consider to be a complaint, in which the defendant is to be imprisoned (as part of his complaint "public debate" Barrick has, by the way, just called on the Noir Canada authors to officially inform them that they are to stop using this term...).
If we recall the surreal Garver speech, the achievement initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the universal freedom of search and search for the truth that is essential for every democratic society.
It generally supports the right to quote confidential sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the basis for intellectual activity itself.
If in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of this world, without showing up to the repeated struggle, who else will be able to do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could create it if it was guided by the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
He has the right to answer.
The university environment we belong to is already capable of conducting debates and disagreements and resolving conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s superior complaint clearly shows that despite what he claims, he does not have the slightest desire to conduct a transparent debate.
For the university world, it is a loss, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures that would limit such a type of wrongful acquisition.
Operations to save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand
Bush's administration and remittances to Congress, both Republicans and democracy, finally reached agreement yesterday on the greatest saved economic plan since the Great Crisis of the Thirty Years.
A new version of the plan, with the help of 700 billion US dollars to reverse the financial crisis, which has been the culmination of Wall Street for months, has yet to be approved by both Chambers of Congress.
In particular, it provides for better control of the elected representatives over its applications, new mechanisms to ensure the payment of the public money saved, new measures to capture the number of houses involved in the non-payment and also the right to monitor the amount of wages paid by the company's managers.
The US Finance Minister Henry Paulson, President of the Snow House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republicans at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news yesterday a few minutes after midnight, after the end of the two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress and we have reached an agreement that will be effective on the markets," said Bush's administrative representative, Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done so that the real economy and ordinary Americans are safe from a crisis just taking place on Wall Street," the Democrats explained.
"This is a key point: if we don't do this, trauma, chaos and the daily lives of Americans will be enormous," said Republican Judd Gregg.
Over the last few hours, negotiations have taken place on the maximum return from the fear of the effect of further failures on investor deployment.
The time limit was the opening of markets this morning.
Both candidates to the US President were invited to the debate later and both expressed themselves rather for the agreement, but did not recall expressing their discontent with the need to avoid such a final solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has signed an agreement on certain measures, in particular the aim of which is to enable owners to maintain their homes, and measures to be taken on behalf of the working States that have been saved by companies.
"If we ask the taxpayers to take special measures for some people's non-responsibility, there is no reason to be pleased.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on the waves of television.
His Republican rival John McCain, who was questioned by another station whether he would vote for the proposed plan, replied, "I would like to see details, but I hope so."
"The rough drawings that I have read, [they say] that it is about something that we all will have to spend and with which we can continue.
Choosing inactivity is not acceptable at all," he said.
The goal of the 700 billion-dollar plan is to redeem from the taxpayers’ money questionable claims and the risk and non-saleable assets of the US financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis by breaking the bubbles on the property market, which first led to the collapse of risk mortgage loans (subprimes), then transferred to another expanded form of loans (PCAA) and ended up freezing cash and disbanding banks and financial institutions.
The failure of the first proposal for a last week's agreement is the awareness of the Republican MPs.
Since the Democrats agreed that, for some "toxic" assets of companies with problems, the government will only handle them, but will not buy them, it is a belief that the pointless situation is blessed.
In order to bring the anti-conventional views of Congress closer together, measures have been taken to ensure that the government will be able to introduce new fees that will help it to get its contribution back if it has to recover losses for a period of five years as a result of the programme.
The new plan shall be calculated with a contribution of the first amount of 250 billion to which it will be possible to add another 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The contribution of another 350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for Washington's help, he's getting shares in the rescue companies that will pay him dividends in case of profit and that he'll be able to sell again when he's all over.
The federal government will be able to delay the procedures for the entertainment of properties linked to the loans covered by the plan, as well as set limits for the amount of assessment and compensation paid by the employees affected by the company.
Planners would like to vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet certain that their plan will be green.
Yesterday, votes against the project continued in both the Republican and the democratic camps.
"It is quite obvious that Washington does not hear you," said Scott Garrett, a member of the Financial Commission for Snow White, at the address of the voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there is a solution.
But it's not a solution to earn on the payers."
The democratic representative Brad Sherman, a moderator of the group of congressmen called "the selection of skeptics", presents the whole thing differently, but it comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred respected professors of economics, among them three Nobel Prize holders, wrote to us: we ask Congress not to hurry too much and carefully examine which way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe has again confirmed that this crisis is a global crisis.
Following the end of the extraordinary meeting, three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Government of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it is derogating from the purchase of its competitors, which has been in the process of collapse since it lost EUR 2 billion (EUR 2.9 billion) as a result of a crisis in the purchase of properties in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, among the 20 largest European banks and among the 10 largest insurers.
"We are not coming to this money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wooter Bos yesterday.
"In return, we gain the right to vote in the bank and influence.
And that's exactly what the stewards and the households of today are able to appreciate."
On the other side of the La Manche channel, it seems that the British government has launched a further bank crisis affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government had to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) had made loans to purchase properties.
According to his yesterday's announcement, the Spanish bank of Santander will buy the branches and accounts of the customers of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank on Northern Rock, which the British government has to renationalize from the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of social icons
His beauty with azure eyes long represented his tummy, according to other weaknesses.
Was this American actor fooled by the charming smile of narcissism?
Yes and no.
Humility, sensitivity, and impersonal talents that were his own also distanced him from the strong category that produces real stars.
What a long journey it was!
Paul Newman died on Friday in 83 years at his ranch in Connecticut as a result of lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of America’s fat years.
Less than Brando, who had been like and for a long time been some rival of his on the film board, Newman was a more careful actor, certainly a Christian, but also an apostle of freedom and a breakdown of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and a mother of Hungarian origin.
One of these European roots was born one of the famous faces of the American dream.
No exaggerated ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because he saw this whole country in love with himself made mana, a warrior in the Pacific War, injured in a battle that began in Yale in the early 50s, then visited the New York Actor's Studio and celebrated the triumph in the theater, television and dances in the movie.
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also a car racing man who was the second at a 24-hour Le Mans competition in 1979, and at the same time a sexual symbol, although since 1958 he has created a model couple with an actress Joanne Woodward.
With it, there are also the dark places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the ride of the own show-business, which will always remain to a certain degree mysterious.
A good man, in the most noble word of meaning.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend caused the movie's lovers to give up, while his big role together competes on a black record.
After it, more than half a century has been defiling the changing American seventh art.
In memory, a charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who refuses his sensible wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the Cat on a burnt roof, adapted by Tennessee Williams from 1958.
From less ancient times (1990) we have his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by an old age marriage that has failed to meet all expectations.
So many other Newman Pauls went into history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, a violent, unforgettable delicacy from Someonebody Up There Likes Me (In Sign of Hatred) Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, took over after his death, which Newman introduced in 1956 in true knowledge.
A very great gangster in The Sting (Podraz), Oscar for the best film in 1973.
A warm and vindictive ball player in The Hustler Robert Rosen (1961), the same character will be created in The Color of Money Martin Scorsese, which will bring him the only Oscar with seven nominations in 1987.
This face of travelling ages, it was him.
And him again.
In his career, he's going to have different times together.
Young people are especially familiar with her thanks to the cultural Slap Shot George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, a non-traditional hockey coach.
The fans met with him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
He then completed his career as Irish Mafia's sister in the Road to Perdition Sam Mendese in 2003.
Unlike a few film legends, which had quite soon left the novel, Newman remained in the field for a long time, perhaps judging Hollywood with his riches, adventures and concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier, not without a sense of humor, considered her as "a living challenge underplaying", the judge, that in his performances he was too pressing on the pill.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the role came as an upheaval, the profession was not always so soft.
The first lovers, however, played less often than the outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, lupus and sophomores, whose fall and revolts reflected in his perfect paintings.
As director, Newman revealed a little of his own shyness.
His film, Rachel, from 1968 (according to Roman Canadian Margaret Laurence), in which his wife, Joanne Woodward, played the main role, gave a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
To his son, Scott, who lost his overdose, he dedicated a film to Harry and Son in 1984, full of shame and grief.
In the line of duty that Newman received yesterday, his great friend and former associate Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) proudly declared: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Charity, love of life, such are the main characteristics of a dead actor.
If we remember his legendary career, a great warrior also leaves behind for civil rights, ecology, independent film, opposition to the fall of Hollywood.
Like him, we were used to seeing on the bottles of wine vinegar, sauce, biscuits, and other foods, which may have seemed rather untasteful, although at first it was a gag.
However, the proceeds of the sale went to the account of his Children's Enormity for a difficult childhood.
Newman, rather than letting himself get caught up in fame, has been involved in society for the last time.
To his five daughters he left a letter containing these words: "Always and to the end your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was a pleasure to be here."
And it was an honor for us to watch the life course of such a clear and generous American artist.
And besides, the end of the world, a model citizen.
What was made in the factory on the invoices Zuschlag & spol.?
Soon, 8 October, the trial of Janosi Zuschlag and his associates begins in criminal proceedings.
Politicians and their associates are, in addition to other criminal acts, including the burning of the leaves, accused of the fraud of the long term and systematic criminal organisations, which have resulted in extremely significant damage.
According to the prosecutor, they used the money obtained in public competitions for their own purposes and carried out their duties often with fictitious invoices.
The money from the state and self-government - we collect about 65 million forints - have traveled partly into the treasure organization Fiatal Balldal, partly into the pockets of individuals.
The manner in which he also informed the investigating authority was based on the fact that the money obtained in public tenders was selected on the basis of invoices for which there was no real counter-value and that the company’s commitments were never met.
According to the complaint, much of the invoice was false.
Prints to these invoices came from the Izsefváros market, the bullet seal was produced in Kiskunalas.
On behalf of which companies the production of the invoice was to take place, it was decided, inter alia, on the road to the northern coast of Balaton, on which István Ladose János Zuschlag sent.
According to his statement, his first appointment was to look at the pensions and restaurants.
They applied for accounts for their consumption, according to which the invoices submitted in the framework of public competitions issued by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, respectively by the Central City Self-Government, were then produced.
The invoice was presented by most István Lados with his partner András Õrim, who, according to our information, wrote the most frequently needed reports to obtain subsidies.
On his "Study Way" Lados looked at one of the basements.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlagem and his associates in 2003, this catering facility was provided by Biztos Pont for the ninety-year-old group.
However, according to the company leader, so many people would not be able to do so at the same time.
Similarly, the invoices presented in the summer of 2002 with the name Job Jöv Şért, later Együtt and Harmadik Évesredért were moved.
The guesthouse in Badacsonytomy had only three rooms, more than ten people in it could not sleep one night, although the bill included a hundred and thirty guests.
However, the authors of the printed works with a rich imagination ignored this even when they quoted the documents of the company related to the accommodation - Pigal s. r. o., in which, according to the information provided to the public representative, the documents bearing the name Job Jöv ürt and Hoppá did not appear.
The head of the company, Gypian Farkas for hvg.hu, stated that when he was summoned to the prosecutor's office and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that it was false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were on the wrong spot."
As he added, in addition to formalizing, there was no agreement that hundreds of people lived, so there are only eleven rooms that do not have such a large capacity.
In addition, the invoice also included food, with their restaurants not working for a long time.
The top invoice producers were not convinced that the prominent Budapest travel office organizes only foreign travel, and the cash payment invoice, which was also not compatible with the company's invoice practice, was introduced as a transport service to Hungary.
In addition, as it turned out during the investigation, VAT was also included in the document, although the organisation of travel to countries outside the European Union was exempted from VAT.
On the four documents submitted by Jobb Jöv ért, Hotel Réfülöp s. r. o. did not agree, inter alia, to the amount of VAT. However, the company's activity does not include the 25%, but the 15% VAT, which was also the only printed invoices that were produced by hotel employees, was written by hand.
In addition, they cancelled the "issuers" invoice by stating to one company how the investigation of the State represented, as a road transport activity of goods which was not initially carried out on the investment advice.
The fact that the invoices issued by the donors Együtt and Harmadik Évesredért and the companies XXI. After the Culturalist Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false also broke because of the formal deviations - the inappropriate format of the invoice and the incorrect stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Sports Camp in Kunfehértó, whose representatives denied that the invoices would be exposed.
For example, the delinquents did not even notice that the company HIB s. o. from Nyíregyház was at the time (2001) when a group of Fiatal Városèrt, in liquidation, was eating, so, according to our information, the liquidating commissioner of the company also refused to issue the paper.
The invoices were well-known
The second group of invoices is made up of those who knew they were going to expose a fictional invoice.
The Esély Budapest Foundation has issued accounts for about four million forints for the Harmadik Évesredert Foundation at the request of the organization Fiatal Balldal - Ifjú Socialisták.
The head of Collab s. r. o. admitted, according to the complaint, to issue a fictional account, one of the accused Ludovic Györfi.
With Zuschlagem and his associates also cooperated with Biogate s. r. on, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 kept Jobb Jöv ért and Atlasz and Vörösfeny invoices worth about five million forints that did not have real economic activity.
Nor did the movement of money, because the invoices created were later cancelled, which, of course, the organizations forgot to include in their documents.
The other group of invoices are those that were bound to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the representative of the Ukrainian dealer Delta Trió s. r. o., dealing with fuel and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, where the company is not to be found.
In October, November and December 2005, the company presented a number of invoices for the sale of computer equipment worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data from the investigation, these invoices were purchased by the Kish Investment company, which was in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
One of these companies was a man from Romania who was supposed to hand over the books on the company, including Ivan Kubatov, in the years 2002-2005.
As we know, in the course of the investigation, Kubatov admitted that on behalf of the company he issued invoices to the companies Atlas, Hoppa and the donors Együtt and Harmadik Évesredért and accepted their own counter-evaluation.
At the request of Ivan Kubatova, Romanian citizens were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
However, not one of the companies actually worked, according to the defendant, because there was no job.
However, he was blessed by the companies because, at the request of the co-indicted attorney Zsolta Szente, who also prepared their letter of submission, he presented the company invoice to Atlas and Y-Generacion companies connected to Zuschlag.
On behalf of the company Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade dal Kubatov with a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The State representative concluded that Cuba’s share of the invoices and VAT was 10 per cent.
To expose fictional invoices, this time to the selection procedure for the company Biztos Pont, a man also used Szi-Beri k.t.
In January 2006, Y-Generación and Sövetség and Modern Magyarországért presented proposals for the Public Competition Award Mihálye Táncsicse (TMA), a publicly successful socialist organisation.
They received 500 thousand units, but did not apply the amounts to the objectives set out in the proposals.
To avoid this, TMA submitted five fictional invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were also found during a home visit at the Arpád Kemecsei's office in the Ministry of Education.
During the counting of the part of the defendants, it is likely to describe the course of the production of invoices, as she has already done in the prosecutor's office.
It may be more interesting if you decide to reveal everything yourself, the main accused János Zuschlag.
His present - day statement is not too detailed, and although he has promised many times that he has not done so far.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for the payment of a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, the socialists may have concluded an agreement with him and Zusi will take it on.
He could have been offended by the fact that his application for a reduction in the conditions of his detention, since the detention of the house, had not been heard at all.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes, who have suffered much greater harm than they have done so far, may be free to go through or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their homes, he does not have this option.
Psychology of drudgery: Why are we wasting more money?
At auctions customers are willing to spend more money, to overestimate goods.
The neurological and economic basis of this well-known - and apparently irrational - behavior has been able to reveal to researchers from the field of neurology and economy of New York University.
According to their study published in Science magazine, people don't want to stay in eBay auction competition, so they'd rather pay too high a price.
Research using experimental auction tried to map the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers agreed, the other group participated in field auctions, using the method of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) tested the active area of the brain of the pilots.
In both games, participants could win money, however, during the auction game, the important element of which is to block the other side, began to function intensively during the loss of the entire being under the brain core, called the striatum.
This brain area plays in addition to many other functions in the "self-recovery" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, it is possible, according to researchers, to explain how to avoid direct street reactions.
In support of their theory, members of the research team from a number of economies carried out a financial cross-check investigation.
Under different conditions, three groups had been competing against one partner.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product concerned, and they made their commitments.
In addition, members of the other group were promised that if they quit winning, they would receive $15.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members also paid these money.
Thus, the difference between the two groups was based on the fact that one was highlighted by the win and the other loss.
However, the members of the "towards the loss" group were willing to go higher than it was in the control and "victorious" group, which confirms the neurologist's hypothesis.
"These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
They have so far explained the phenomena noticeable in auctioning the joys of winning and avoiding the risk.
When neurological imaging methods helped us to resolve the dispute between these two theories so that we have now reached the third explanation," noted Andrew Schutter, professor of Economics College of New York University.
Hepatitis: when to look for a doctor?
About half a billion people around the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the main causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated to be hundreds of thousands, although only seven thousand of them are treated, because the patient often does not know that they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is a summary of the name of the infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms there are many similarities, there is signs of inflammation of the liver and the liver, however, the cause of the disease and the disease they cause differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main ways, depending on the underlying disease: type A and E hepatitis (e.g. food-infected, water), type B, C, D hepatitis and other blood and body fluids (sperm, secretion, saliva).
Travellers should in any case be protected by choking against A and B viruses, and no C vaccine virus exists.
The symptoms of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after the use of the infected food, usually due to nausea, weakness, chest problems, vomiting.
Then there is a yellow, bright chair and dark urine on the skin and the eyeballs. Treatment can take up to two to three weeks.
Every year millions of people around the world die from the more serious type of disease, from liver cancer and from hepatitis B-induced liver cirrhosis.
The main reason is that according to estimates, only every tenth of the infected medicinal product is treated.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it may lead to liver cirrhosis or cancer of the liver.
Most of those infected with their disease don't even know, the cause of the disease destroys the liver cells randomly, so the first symptoms are delivered in many cases up to 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, regular testing is very important.
In three groups, this disease occurs more frequently than in the average: between people who had passed blood transfusions before 1991, between drug users and people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated total number of units infected with chronic hepatitis C 200 million is estimated.
Since the disease can show a routine laboratory examination, a person should, in case of any signs of unknown origin, refer to his doctor.
In early detection, the disease is therapeutic, the virus can be removed from the body, preventing such infections and preventing cancer.
On 30 September, the World Day of Hepatitis, which was first organized by organisations representing the disease, was organized worldwide in 2004.
Its purpose is to warn of the chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, the causes of their formation and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Who believes in God is so bad?
According to recent research, belief in God works as a certain analgesic, which could make death easier for already Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, examined the way in which belief in the god of perception of pain is influenced by the British newspaper Telegraph.
In a rather bizarre survey, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were subjected to electrical shocks, while all observed the painting depicting Miss Maria.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to eliminate much of the pain.
Thanks to the technique, a detailed examination of the human brain has also shown that Catholics have been able to activate this part of their brain that is responsible for controlling pain.
Research is the first of a series of studies attended by scientists, philosophers and theologians from various parts of the university.
The test was carried out in such a way that a creative instrument was attached to the left-hand hand of the test subject, which issued electrical shocks.
Researchers have asked participants to try to observe two paintings: Sassoferrat, a 17th-century woman from the 17th century and a Lady with the border of Leonardo da Vinci, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the study hoped that the view of Miss Marie would give the believers a certain state of worship, while da Vinci’s image was chosen because it was not too different from the first and acted in a soothing way.
The pilots spent half an hour in the MRI scan and during this time they got in four consecutive parts of 20 electroshocks, while watching the picture separately with religious or general themes.
The Catholics said that when they looked at Miss Marie, they felt "safe" as if they were "old" and "slow down, filled them with peace."
When watching the image with religious theme, they felt 12 percent less pain than when Leonardo’s work was ahead of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the study, believes that a similar effect can be achieved by means of any powerful image even in atheists, it is only necessary to find the right photograph.
"We should find a picture that will be very positive, from the position of a mother or father," said the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases also change our personality," Wright added.
After such excellent results, it is only a question of what effect it would have on the regulation of the pain of the believers if they were shown some of Leonard’s masonry or similar calibre.
Would it mean a look at Miss Marie's quality to achieve even better results?
You're what you're gonna share
About their tenth birthdays, Google can tell you that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as in the sky above; they know where they were on vacation, which is going through a professional examination and what they're interested in.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's bosses, it's still not enough.
However, with regard to skeptics, making parallels with Orwell's dark vision, these are not clearly the very essence of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated to the Financial Times that the main goal of Google is to gather more personal data about users, which is necessary to enable the founders of Google to keep their original purpose: "Let's arrange all the information in the world!"
According to the spokesperson, the company is standing after ten years of secular work only at the beginning of the day so that it can work with all the information.
On the question of what will be five years later, Schmidt answered that if Google could answer questions like "What am I going to do tomorrow?" or "what work would actually be worth it?" - on such apparently simple questions, however, software will not be able to answer until they know enough about users.
Not all users of the Internet know well that the exact search words are captured during the internet search and the IP address they were looking for and on which sites the interested parties have moved after the search.
Thanks to the Personalized Search service started two years ago, users can, for example, keep their browsing history, look back at what they were looking for and click on, and then generate in the long term the findings adapted to them more directly - the same logic will be based on the recommended service, which will enable us to offer products and services based on the previous and retained preferences.
What if my data is being used against me, what if someone sees what I'm doing? - users who have fear when looking at Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of the potential power represented by the company is more dangerous than the reaction of the Internet to the knowledge of guilt, fear of torture, desire for freedom or even resistance to power.
However, it is confirmed that all the terms sought are not only caught, but in justified cases a third party may also be issued, in such legal cases the personal rights of internet users shall not be preserved.
The most well-known example of the past was the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that allowed the identification of pedophiles from the community websites of Orkut established through it.
However, Internet users who are afraid of personal rights could still breathe in May, when the company had successfully proved its truth in the dispute with the FBI by hand with the organisation for the protection of electronic rights EFF: Google must not be forced to provide any information requested by the FBI in the future.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully defended nearly fifty thousand web addresses and thousands of search terms, which it received with a call for reinforcements prior to the year of the adopted law on child protection, but failed to obtain the lists of individual user search items, and the full lists of web pages and keywords of the two-month period.)
Google’s view is quite different: it is targeted at those who are afraid to provide their personal data, because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be by using Google’s services, exposed to injury, and they come out against it with a revolution that belongs to supranational companies with conservative images.
And so far, the American geek of culture and its wildest breed, grouping around itself excited computer fans, activists and users, who appear in many countries, in it sees a new generation of big business, "corporation what is now cool", unlike his rival Microsoft, considered for Windows as the world's vendors, as both fight for the same goals.
This can be caused by Google not requiring the identification code from its users and does not want money for its applications; open, free and constantly fresh source of information and package of programs acts as much more accessible, younger, "cooler" than the practice of official software.
However, it can also be caused by the fact that the geeks understand precisely the very problematic relationship of the internet and the personal rights that has brought with them one of the most secure keywords in recent years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is nothing but cooperation, that we deliberately leave traces behind and use the communication channels that we have available, and although their range is different, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can lead a profile right away on a number of community sites from Facebook to Xang, which can easily connect to other services, such as Twitter or last.fm applications, recording his listening music, all of which can then connect to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, besides, he can write a blog that will automatically discover his latest photo gallery, which is based on Flickr or Picasa.
However, we can read about a lot of exemplary cases from which she explains: a friend in the morning, looking at the flood of photos of the common friends, can easily find out who her crazy friend spent the night, or the company can throw out his employee only because on her blog, she will have her honest opinion on top management: one thing is certain, the concept of private life has been completely overestimated today.
The person who lives online consists of what he shows himself, so we could define the basic thesis that is hiding behind today's youth.
And whoever wants to hide something or at least avoid the Google monopoly has the option (or Scrooglem, who uses the Google search system, yet deliberately does not affect the tracks).
For example, a small number of people are not registered on community sites so they can not be found. Online Google application from the text editor by photoeditor and the news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to large server parks and that do not set us the best possible profile.
Public opinion doesn't expect much secret when Google shows teeth.
The company has a current value of $156 billion higher than IBM $140 billion), Intel $124 billion or Coca Cola $110 billion, AdWords/AdSense advertising sites are threatening the investment of advertising agencies and services that are constantly being implemented at a speed that is seriously affecting not only Microsoft but also many other software designers.
However, critical observers also find the counterpoints that work with disturbing perceptions: for example, senior management has completely rejected employee protests after a double rate of corporate school fees, at any rate the daily feeding of employees was too expensive according to the company's management, all of which is lost in addition to the fact that in 2006 Google was still in favour of the Chinese government and, in the sense of their agreement, filters any finding that is due to the good taste, and the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that it never presupposes new services, only when it can be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the following months and years can move the world in new places: while some believe that the Google project aimed at scanning and archiving books and magazines has such dimensions that it will soon have something to do with the US Supreme Court, others fear its health system, in which we can build a complete own health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google compiles a genetic database can then serve as a good source of material even for the next generation of sci-fi writers, the famous novel by Cory Doctor's "Scrooview" describes the future with Orwell's reminisces, in which one can safely approach the person with only data from Google.
A double killer from the Uzda helped to remove the footprints of two young people
Two young people listened to the police in the case of a double murder in Ozda, according to a reasonable suspicion, helping to eliminate the foothold of this crime, said Borsod's Chief Police Department spokesperson on Tuesday.
Persons who have been suspected have been found and are currently accused of assisting a criminal offence.
Both young people, according to the MTI two girls, are reached for freedom.
Helping a criminal is punishable by the deprivation of liberty for up to 5 years.
Suspect of double murder in Ozda, a 23-year-old man, was taken into temporary custody on Sunday.
He's suspected of a criminal crime in advance of the planned multiple murder for real reasons.
During the investigation, it appeared that a 23-year-old man owed a 53-year-old man a higher amount.
The suspect didn't want to pay his debt, so he threw his believer out last Wednesday to an operating room in Ozda, where he killed a man first and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, a young man was prepared to commit a crime in advance, as evidenced by the fact that he had committed a murder weapon hidden at the scene of the crime.
The weapons and the circumstances of its use are investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy a Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - offered a Warsaw Stock Exchange for buying a 100-cent stock package of Prague Stock Exchanges.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish party, although the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is a state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, who wants 60 percent of the securities sold in a few months.
As the Czech economic journal E15 writes, the Polish offer represents the highest amount that has been offered by interested parties to the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to the Czech lists, the sale of Viennese Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, New York Exchange, the London Stock Exchange, and the Deutsche Börse were offered.
The chief of the Prague Stock Exchange Petr Koblic said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all stakeholders, and did not rule out that it could lead to the destruction of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by experts on the stock markets to be between 5 and 10 billion.
According to the shareholders agreement, approximately 90 per cent of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank of Patria Finance, with approximately 25% share, followed by the Czech Spouse with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r. with 13.5 per cent.
On the financial crisis from the perspective of the European Charters
In its Tuesday comments devoted to the deepening international financial crisis, the European front lists already refer to "the second 11 September".
We can thank the American President for the global financial disaster, who blames the Romanian La Repubblica. The President has not even been able to dry up his own side in support of the soon-paid bill aimed at correcting this desperate situation...
Instead of a new Pearl Harbor, which reminded the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk about the second of September 11th.
A part of the Madrid press also sees the culprit in Washington.
According to El Mundo, he has brought the world economy beyond the collapse of the present lack of political leadership.
The threat of the collapse of the American financial system is constantly growing, which will ultimately pay the whole world for.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but after the Congress vote, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political instrument to solve the crisis.
The world's economy is hanging in the air - just when one of the biggest changes in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be mentioned, says the Geneva Journal Tages-Anzeiger.
To date, individual States may place a life-saving circle to the corrupting monetary institutions and taxable persons can save them from the scourge.
However, if more banks are involved as dominoes, money will no longer be enough, nor any further improvisation.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to move across their national selfishness and to unite control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, the dominant monetary institutions received more than EUR 100 billion, recalling the Vienna Der Standard, who are afraid that, like the Americans, in the interest of solving the crisis, they will have to reach deeper into the pocket and European taxpayers, even more real.
The European Union is facing a crisis that has been covered by the old continent as a tsunami until it is really gone.
"Savers" do not have to have the billions of euros immediately, however, it would be good if they had established firmly, in which case it is reasonable to collect the taxpayer's money to prevent further damage.
Smart car simulates jets
What would possibly be the best way to develop technologies that can prevent collisions, if not imitation of the obstacles that occur in the natural world?
For example, at the school.
The development of a strategic idea of a surprising project, presented at the Japanese CEATEC Fair, has inspired engineers from Nissan Chemelaci. It was about building a new generation of anti-fungal systems.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a biomimetic robotic system for the management of the type BR23C, a robotized mine equipped with the properties of the bees, with the ultimate aim of the creation of a system that can eliminate all collisions.
"During the summer, every student creates his own personal space of oval shape, which is actually very much like our safety protective package," explained Kazuhiro Doi, Director-General of the label for the field of technological PR and research and development.
An important role is played by complex eyes, which can be seen in all directions in the direction of the sun at more than 300 degrees.
In order to copy the compound function of the eye, the engineers saw the idea of laser remote.
It identifies the obstacles at a distance of up to 2 metres before BR23C in the 180 degrees field, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the ship's microprocessor, which is immediately converted into an operation aimed at preventing a collision.
The obstacle is caught during a second break, then the robotized car starts to simulate the movements of the bees and the rotation of the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent the impact immediately changes direction.
In contrast to any existing system, this avoidable manoeuvre is carried out in an instinctive manner.
"If not, the robot car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshijuki Ando, Head of the Mobility Laboratory and the Robotic Car Project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, because this technology is the most vulnerable and internal layer of safety protection package, within which the impact is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process has to reflect what the bees do to avoid other bees.
This process must not last long before the eye is blinded.
However, unlike the hip, this movement cannot be directed up, down or down, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction that the wheel can rotate.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered by the bees when they are avoided, only the possibility of turning, acceleration and slowing was applied in the case of a robot car.
BR23C uses lithium polymer accumulators that are lighter and have higher energy density, which means they have a longer life than lithium ionte variants.
According to Andoa, an important instinctive, intelligent response, not the ability to process, is less then storing data.
This mechanism must process and react only to several incoming signals in a second.
There is no need to keep them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuvers, so it constantly uses only memory of the size of a few kilobytes.
He doesn't need memory with giga or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step towards developing a technology that serves to avoid immediately, which, according to Nissan's estimate, could be achieved in serially manufactured vehicles over ten years.
Another option of application may be to connect the unit to the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the motorist to the target target after the departure of the obstacles.
Damn precious child already has a name.
The Savings Package Act, worth 700 billion dollars, which is to be distributed into several instalments and whose purpose is to redeem the bank's non-quality loans, is already in writing.
Half of the amount will be used in the first round.
After further discussions, which ended until Saturday after midnight of the American East Time, the Congress' representatives reached agreement on a lasting debate on a package of $700 billion in total, announced by the Reuters agency.
"We have made significant progress," announced Nancy Pelosi, the democratic president of the Snow White House, according to which only the signing of the agreement is left.
The compromise on the package was also supported by both Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said about the result of the compromise: "The programme will work and be effective, but further steps must be taken."
The written form of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday at 8 o'clock on the night of Washington time (then Monday at 2 o'clock in the morning of the Central European time), although no special entry into stock exchanges was possible.
The draft legislative standard, which is heard on behalf of the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilisation Act, which is to be established, will be voted on by the representatives of the House first Monday, then by the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosio on Saturday night, then the news of the deal was also welcomed at the White House.
"With the progress achieved at night, we are satisfied and very much appreciate the efforts of both sides to stabilise our financial markets and to protect our economy," White House spokesperson Tony Fratto said.
The programme is still different from the original proposal by Bush's administrative authorities, in which it should have been intended to cover the purchase of non-quality securities secured by mortgages at the same time a total of $700 billion.
It is now possible to lose in the first round a maximum of half the amount of 700 billion, so that 250 billion will be used immediately, as expected on Monday, after the Congress will decide, and the Ministry of Finance will buy them valuable securities secured by mortgages that are valued as non-quality, the remaining $100 billion will then depend on the President's decision.
The programme will be controlled by a special committee, which will also be chaired by the Federal Reserve Bank.
The second half of the $700 billion will depend on the Congress's next decision.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can at the same time buy non-quality loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, and other "food" loans.
The purchase may take place within auctions and directly by the competent representatives of the Ministry.
The legal standard will allow the companies concerned to participate in the insurance programme, in which the Ministry of Finance will provide them with guarantees on the grounds of concern, for which companies will then pay the price corresponding to the amount of the damage expected.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary means to meet the urgent requirements of the US financial system of up to $700 billion, whether it is an extensive purchase of bad funds, their insurance or the prevention of the systemic risk associated with the collapse of some of the large money institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be prepared to introduce the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
The boss banks that are in trouble waiting for state aid can, on the other hand, be counted by the government reducing their distance - which is simply called a "gold fall" in the Baltic slang.
In addition, to limit their payments only in certain cases, these restrictions will depend on the way in which they are granted to the Ministry.
The restriction basically means that if the ministry purchases within the auction, a tax deduction will be imposed on gold deposits if the bank's directors do not fall directly into retirement.
In the case of direct purchase of non-quality loans, the government shall aggressively step forward in order to ensure that the money for management is not overrun.
It should be added that the existing Gold Drops Treaty is not changing, the restrictions concern only new contracts, which should be a further incentive for participation in the programme.
"It is the first case in American history when there will be legal restrictions on the remuneration of directors of general," commented the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services of Representatives, democracy Barney Frank.
In addition, the State of the participating banks will have the right to a share programme, which reduces the risk of taxpayers, since once the economy and its savings are built on the feet of the bank, they can also benefit from this transaction.
The draft plan contains that in the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal determining how taxable persons can recover expected losses from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were also votes expressing in relation to the plan of doubt.
"The American citizens did not ask us to do this, that is, the dollar of taxpayers not to be saved," said a Republican Congressman from California Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague from Ohia Mary Kaptur judges that exactly those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street were required to adopt the provisions.
Industrial prices continued to grow
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by 0.1 per cent in August 2008, compared with 12.9 per cent in July 2007, the Central Statistical Office announced.

Also domestic sales prices in the processing industry increased slightly, by 0.1 per cent, compared to July.
The highest price increase in the leather and footwear industry (2.8 per cent) in August 2008 was mainly due to the monthly price increase in the brewing and saddlery production sector by 4.6 per cent, respectively, of footwear production by 2.5 per cent.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemical and product production sector (1.6 per cent).
Prices fell in the oil processing sector (1.4 per cent), the production of electrical machinery and equipment (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimum - in the wood industry (0.1 per cent).

In the twelve-month comparison of domestic return in the individual processing industries, prices grew most in the oil processing industry (32.4 per cent).
In the steel industry, it was possible to observe 13.2% in the production of foodstuffs, beverages and tobacco products, which are of decisive weight, then 11% in the price increase.
Prices fell in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent) and the production of electrical machinery and equipment (0.3 per cent).
In other processing industries, the rate of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
Total prices in the processing industry increased by 10.2 per cent last year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water industry exceeded the prices of 18.7 per cent in the previous year.

Next year to the United States without a visa?
According to King Gönčov, it is a great hope that around 12 January the US-Madjear Agreement on Wireless Relations will enter into force, ministers of foreign affairs spoke about it in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her opinion, "the only thing that matters now is if an electronic system of travel authorisation, respectively, is established at sea".
At the same time, she pointed out that the part of the new system will not be allowed to enter, but tourists will have to register before leaving.
The representative of the Hungarian diplomat from today continues in negotiations in Washington.
He will meet with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Condoleezzo Rice, who will transmit the Central Cross with the Star of the Order in favour of the Republic of Hungary and conduct talks with the foreign policy adviser of the Presidential Candidate of the Democratic Party of Barack Obama and the Republic of John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are for bank savings packages
Barack Obama and John McCain, presidents of both major American parties, agreed on Sunday to ensure their support for the government's bank's bailout package of $700 billion, which, of course, are also politicians who require a delegation of finance ministers.
After several months of the conference's marathon and administrative representatives were announced early Sunday morning: the basic agreement on the bank's bailout was concluded.
The financial package, aimed at overcoming the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, became a central issue of the presidential campaign.
Like Obama, McCain is accordingly referred to as the most suitable candidate for the country to remove from the economic crisis.
According to the most thorough research at the same time as they got to the front of the economic issue, Obama gained a certain advantage again and came to McCain's conclusion, which he secured after the Republican Convention appointing Sarah Palinov as Vice-President.
Obama said on Sunday at a pre-election meeting in Detroit that the package bill of 700 billion would quickly be adopted by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contained passports relating to consumer protection, which it also supports.
"We must act immediately, responsible (...) to your places, savings, the entire industry, the stability of the whole economy is threatened by danger," said the 35,000 team.
He didn't let himself miss the opportunity to call McCain's ideas about economics the old ones.
McCain, in his interview with the ABC TV station, explained: "All of this will be a bit of a cause (...) but nothing is simply not possible."
As stated by the Republican Senator, the proposal sets out the establishment of a commission of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the derogation for the top representatives on which it lasted.
Obama told the CBS station that McCain had no major role in the negotiations, but he was himself in daily contact with the minister.
The chairman of the filmmaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Sunday that the Swedish representatives would vote on the bill, perhaps on Monday.
Print preview of the German language area
The right camp is unbreakable, only the voters within it have become more self-aware - thus analyzes the weak result of CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiderovs are ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
The mirror (spell.de)
In the online issue of the left-wing German newsmagazine, Franz Walter finds out in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its father" the causes of the dramatic defeat of CSU.
According to a well-known politician, CSU's erosion began a long time ago before his office took over Beckstein-Huber's sad duo.
For decades, Christian Socialists have been rebuilding Bavaria - and now these modern citizens are being turned away from them.
The settlement of the period, however, is a problem for the whole of Christian democracy, and so is Angela Merkel.
The debate was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Saturday it ended the process, which could have been predicted for almost ten years: it ended the undisputed hegemony of one state party.
Already ten years ago, in 1998, CSU reached 47.7 per cent, first under the 50% limit.
This was repeated three years ago during the elections to the Bundestag in 2005, which is still so often mentioned in the Stoiber period.
The reason is the modernization that CSU has carried out in this country and that it feeds on its parents.
Sociologists have predicted this for 40 years, but they have been very wrong in the tempo. Secularization, educational results, settlement of the Germans from the east and from the north in the developing regions of Bavaria, however, could not have been without the result of the loyalty of the CSU fans.
Modernisation is linked to the growth of opportunities, which also has its visible political implications.
The right camp is unbreakable, only the voters inside it have become more self-conscious, more critical, more self - centered.
It is also evident that in recent weeks CSU has distanced the most from the very classical civil level; people in the free profession, the unemployed, the adults and the students.
The CSU's support has already dropped by 40 percent.
The Press (depresse.com)
In its article "Who, with whom? The Presidents are in the questions of the detention coalition" refers to the confused domestic situation created by the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wishes to deal with the EVP.
The Committee of the Regions advocates the integration of the ENP into its internal affairs.
BZÖ appears as open to all negotiations, the greens still do not want to get stuck on the wheel.
Elections are behind us, now all around the coalition; in the debate on public television, the presidents did not allow themselves to look very closely at their tickets.
The president, SpÖ Werner Faymann, confirmed that he wanted to deal with the EVP.
And SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two sides is certainly possible - in some countries and in social partnership.
The question is whether he will introduce himself to the coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of the EEA, as Vice-Chairman, left Faymann open.
As he said, Schüssel-Molter's course was voted on every fall.
Repeating this direction does not come to mind.
Molterer responded to the red bids carefully.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to interfere with the internal affairs of the EEAS.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is now completely open, these questions need to be discussed in a decisive way within the EEA.
The president of BZÖ Jörg Haider again appeared in all directions.
"To prevent red-black coalitions, we are prepared to take on government responsibilities," Haider said.
Jaróková: It is necessary to break the charmed circle of poverty and segregation
In Paris today, the European Summit of Equality, which this year is hosted by France, the current Presidency of the European Union.
Lívia Járóková, a member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers of the vocational training in its message, paid attention to the assembly in school, because it is one of the most serious abuses of Roma children, and also the most serious obstacle to their application.
The summit started - on behalf of the French Presidency - Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The representatives of the governments, the European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civil society activities in the field of equal opportunities have been established.
According to the press office of the group of Euro MPs, Fidesz Járóková pointed out that, in addition to the discrimination on the recruitment of workers, the Roma are expelled from the European labour market primarily from their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma have no secondary education and, as a result of poor quality of basic education, they can achieve a higher level of education only a small part of them."
Jaroque further stressed that education as a fundamental human right plays a key role in the application of other human rights.
Investment in early education of Roma children may mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to establish the awareness of these relationships in the broadest circles - between Roma and non-Roman children.
The sooner the Roma student starts school, the more likely it will be to become a productive member of the labour market; through income taxes and consumer taxes they contribute to the national budget.
"The Roma have the right of their citizens of the European Union to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their lack of quality and separate education," said Livia Járóková.
According to the honourable Member, the coherence of the European Union is needed with a focus on the objective and action to speed up the process of disaggregation of schools, which is primarily important for the proper enforcement of existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations.
"It is necessary to break the spelled cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, to provide Roma children with the possibility of democratic space so that they can participate as full-time citizens in the future of Europe," Járóková demanded.
The objective of the European Equality Summit, organised each year since the last meeting in Berlin, is to ensure a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and the elimination of discrimination at the level of Europe as a whole and in individual Member States.
CSU: temporary mercy
The judgment of the obedient two Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October.
Despite the shameful election debate, the debate on personal questions has been devoted to the points of the Bavarian CSU.
The president of the Erwin Huber party and Prime Minister Günther Beckstein can still remain in their seats, the question is as long as this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem, which has suffered the disastrous 17% loss of votes, will be decided by the party's extraordinary congress last October weekend.
In any case, the members of the highly criticised duo were told that they would not fall into their ranks out of all strength.
They tried to calm down the angry members of the group and the basics who, due to the loss of the absolute majority, demanded the day after the "Bavoric tsunami" export of the personal consequences.
Five years ago - true, still under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, who is at the top of his career - she received a Christian-social union of 60.7 percent, now, year after year against Stoiber, but only 43.4 percent of her strength was enough.
In Bavaria, CSU produced 18% of the German HDP "self-control" after 46 years.
They still have conservatives in the southern slum country, which has key importance for the Hungarian economy, high status, but in the future they will be forced into the coalition anyway.
One of the first signs of reorganisation within the party is the fact that a member of a close expert team, which launches a probe on the possible coalition of the MNP government with the liberal FDP, respectively, with a legally oriented free-voice assembly, will also be the Vice-President and Co-Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered to be a possible successor to Huber.
It is ironic that the free will candidate Gabriele Pauli, whose performance against Stoiber, used the Huber-Beckstein duo to carry out the task, but with ambitious municipal politics, they made an unmistakable short process.
The leaders of CSU are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilise Beckstein.
In the transitional period, there will also be an active role for Stoiber, who has so far organized a series of backgrounds, the former prime minister of the country and the former president of CSU called on 28 September the day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made a number of driving notes to the CDU, according to him, they would have earned much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning for both CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the elections to the Bundestag which occurred in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become an official if the CSU, which played a significant role in the national success in 2005, does not, by any means, put together the forces at their feet.
According to Merkel, who, because of her fiasco, was hard to hide her disappointment, would not lose the CSU position negatively impact on the Berlin Great Coalition.
Which is, of course, relative: treating the wounded CSU will not be easier and the crisis of social democrats continues.
The SPD achieved 18.6 per cent of the worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Liquorice:opposite - 110:0
In Sunday's elections, no opposition MP came to the Belarusian Parliament.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexandr Lukashenko, namely by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE) of the laws that occurred when the vote was taken.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not know the elections.
Although the 110-member legislative body of 10 million countries has been losing the opposition for ten years, the opposition combined on behalf of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) before yesterday's elections really hoped that Lukashenko, who had left behind on the basis of a change in the constitution in the elections during the course of the debate in 2006 and the quarter, would renew his presidential mandate, this time "allowing" several opposition MPs to appear in parliament.
That's how ODS left the pre-considered boycott.
In the background of the opposition, Russia was increasingly economically dependent on Belarus - which has consistently taken credit for the slowing down of Russian imports of natural gas and has also contributed to the fact that Beltransgaz, the country's own pipelines, has become in Russian hands - wanted to improve relations with the European Union, where, due to the Belarusian political establishment rated as anti-democratic Lukashenko and the other high position of politics, no entry permits.
On release it was indicated earlier that the OSCE focused on positive moves in the evaluation of the pre-election campaign, rather than on shortcomings - for example, on banning the candidacy for a third of opposition candidates.
The OSCE's Monday flash report, however, has already had reservations about the campaign, during which opposition candidates could essentially not appear in the press, especially since the opposition cannot be present in the counting of votes.
At the same time, according to the opposition, it is possible to feel only improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released for freedom, and Minsk is willing to engage with Moscow and in smaller confrontations, if he continues to refuse to recognise Georgia as being torn off by South Ossetia and Abkhazia, perhaps Russia, with which Belarus forms the state of the alliance, has considered these two territories to be independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that he has begun dialogue between Belarus and the EU," said our letter Alexandr Milinkevič.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should remain, even though "it was too much to be left to the insignificant parliament of a single member of the opposition".
In view of the results of the opposition, he does not plan protest actions, but rather attempts to deliver his message to the voters about the need for economic reforms.
"With this, of course, we have a lot of problems, we have to print opposition papers in Russia, the distribution of barriers to local authorities, but I can see that the change supports as many people as possible, even among older people," said Milinkevic, pointing out that the Lukashenko regime, which considers the creation of social security to be its greatest success, does not constitute the right or officially most supported level of pensioners.
"Because of the country's debt and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time when social security will collapse 'insulting silent graves'," Milinkevič judges.
Unlike opposition policy, Russian observers have assessed elections as democratic.
The leading Community mission of independent states Sergei Lebedév, Russian news agency Ria Novosti, said that "people do not believe in words but in deeds", so the absence of opposition is nothing but evidence of the salvation of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It's the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace, which was introduced by the turning door at the arrival and departure of the employees.
From today on, however, this new measure against anointed people, against those who are thirsty and then go to coffee at work.
The newspaper against the Lenhos was published today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renat Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Presidential Council, Maurem Masi.
"The turning door - says Brunetta - is a tool for better work, higher performance, more presence and more services" explains the minister.
"Now new periods of responsibility and transparency will be opened.
It's reformism," he still stresses Brunetta.
We will complete the establishment of the Chigi Palace in all the buildings of the Council's Presidency.
For Masi, "the choice of turning doors is important from a symbolic point of view".
There were no objections on the part of employees, the Secretary-General assures us: "It was a common procedure with workers and the cooperation of all."
In short, no breakfast at work; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "Nothing better than a proper cappuccino at seven o'clock in the morning."
During a conference at the Higher Education School for Public Administration
in Rome, the minister will finally announce that during three months the absence of public employees for the disease has decreased by 50%, which means 60 thousand more people a year at work."
And it adds that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient
"its payout dynamics – explains the Minister – have doubled over the past 8-10 years in terms of the private sector and is far higher than inflation".
In the meantime, thousands of public employees met to reject Brunett's decree in accordance with the Codacons-supported request.
"Today's Minister of Public Administration will present figures on the lower absence of work due to the disease – writes consumer protection association – the nation's 'pillar chains' is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct employees in public administration who have gathered to declare war against the illegal standards contained in the decree."
In Taru, it will be protested primarily against the exclusion of hospital allowances which depend on activities; the extension of the period in which it is possible to monitor the time limits for the inspection visits and the other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Work injuries, Napolitano: "Resolute prevention"
Every day in Italy there will be 2,500 work injuries, three people will die, and twenty-seven will remain disabled.
Inail's values confirm that in 2007 we have approximately 1,200 deaths as a result of work shocks.
These values testify to the seriousness of the crime, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost double deaths compared to murders.
In order to revitalize the attention of the institutions, social and information media regarding this dramatic problem, Anmil today celebrates the 58th National Day of Labour Impact Victims set on the second Sunday of October in all Italian regions.
"The worrying data extended by Anmila and the tragic news of these days confirm the importance of the question of job security," confirmed the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in a report sent to President Anmila, the National Association for Frozen and Disabled for Labour, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his deep admiration for the continued joint efforts on safety at work, on the protection of injured workers, on the assistance of families of victims and on the participation of the public opinion."
"Naturally, we have been raised 'suffering', sincerely shared face-to-face with tragedies that cause dissatisfaction in the media and participation in public opinion, but every day reality again offers us dramatic cases, even recurring in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is also a source problem here: it is crucial to invest in education and information.
In particular, numerous initiatives are being launched in the field of education so that young people facing the world of work can gain a clearer understanding.
It is necessary to note this phenomenon, not to give up due to its worrying social seriousness, to apply and improve legislative standards.
The President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed, "as a result of the loss of work, it creates an absolutely critical social state, as it violates the conscience of each of us and compels all institutions to make a convincing effort to put an end to this state."
"As regards labour impact data, it seems to be showing a certain positive trend, but it does not support the fact that the number of deaths caused by labour losses is as alarming," noted President Anmila Pietro Mercandelli again.
"We would not want this "deciding effort" to lead to less attention, because at the very moment the attention will rise, tragedy will break out.
"We believe that in general there is still too little to stop the problem of impact and there are many activities that may have an impact on this problem.
It is necessary, according to our opinion - Mercandelli stressed - to increase controls and inspections, but also to engage more strongly in the training of workers, which is from the age of school."
"There is still a need for further efforts - he added - with regard to communication and public participation.
But there is a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers to the phenomenon, which represents an exceptional social phenomenon."
Mercandelli has finally declared that it is a progressive degeneration of the level of entitlement to compensation provided for the victims of work and the "relieve of support care" to which the system has been granted in recent years."
"The aim is therefore to return the employee's insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of those who hurt himself must not depend on spontaneousness or giving time from time to time to the legislator."
Mp3 players accused, exposed to risk
Listening to longer sound music and using portable audio devices as Mp3 players may cause permanent hearing damage.
According to today's Communication from the European Commission, which, in an official report extended in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Committee on Health Risks, which has recently been established and identified (Csseri) Eu.
"From this scientific point of view – we read in the notes – it follows that 5-10% of those who for at least five years listen to music using portable music instruments, weekly more than an hour a day and maintain a high-volume device, risk lasting loss of hearing ability."
"It worries me that so many young people who often use portable audio devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can inadvertently harm their hearing in an uncorrected way," admits Meglen Kuneva.
"From scientific findings – the leader continues – there is a clear risk and it is necessary to react quickly.
The most important thing is that we have to encourage the consumer and publish this information.
We must continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific discovery so that they become fully effective and keep pace with new technology."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this problem in the light of the high use of portable musical instruments and the increasing number of young people exposed to noise of this origin.
"Scientists – the executive official of the Eu – confirm that care needs to be taken and the European Commission is now checking together with other members and parties who have raised the problem of what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise, whose origin is portable musical instruments and similar devices."
At present, there is already a secure European standard that limits the noise level of portable audio devices to 100 dB but raises concerns about hearing damage that can be caused by over-exposure of noise-like exposure.
It is very possible to limit these damage by looking for a solution as a reduction in the level and duration of the exposure.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee Eu states that users of portable music devices, if using loud music (more than 89 decibels) for a period of only five hours a week, will currently exceed the applicable limits corresponding to the maximum permitted noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for a long time may lose their hearing after five years.
This problem should concern 5-10% of users of such devices and can be counted between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Germany leaves the Commission free course for the future of the capital
Today, we start, we close in March, we'll have sums in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli to workers "The Commission for the Future of the capital of Rome", which met in its new home this morning behind Caracall's spa.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and other 49 members of the Commission will draw up manuals for Rome.
When the door is closed in March, Giunta and the General Council will evaluate the analysis and projects so that they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" Campidoglia and his advisor Giannio Alemann in June.
"The Commission is completely independent and there are all political, social and cultural ideas – it wants to highlight Germano – it will have to secure proposals for the development of Rome, which will finally use the political decisions that remain with the Gionta and the General Council.
It's not about any exchange of functions, but it's just about trying to have a place to work on a large project for Rome.
The work will be completed in March and will then be dissolved because these institutions must have a precise time limit.
In June – the mayor announces – we present a strategic plan and will use the work carried out by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome."
To the one who accuses the Commission of negligence, given that its views will not be binding, the German sector: "All matters depend on the work which the Commission will be able to do and the quality of their proposals.
If they are qualitative, like the Commission's Attali's proposals, and I am sure of this in Rome, its benefits will be decisive.
Too often politics will pay off everyday problems and emergencies that will take place from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to stress that "this Commission is neither an unnecessary business nor a bluff: it is completely free, the citizens of Rome will not be the euro and will serve to think and engage the best intelligence in the capital".
For Germany, in essence, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan as a starting point, neither definitive nor improbable, so that it is possible to allow our city an authentic entry at the level it needs, and to think by the unified spirit of its future."
The future, which explains the mayor of Rome "will not only be limited to the current general border, but will look much further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal statute, but also "including the role that Rome can and must play as the capital city of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
One famous American president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the US economy and maintained relations (as well as today as a private citizen) with an enemy of Islam."
Attacks against Obama are growing just as the election date is approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on the web: "This man is full of ambition.
But both of them are stubborn: they think they'll get to the highest post of the nation, who has two governors and five black senators everywhere!"
In fact, these attacks don't say much"; they are attacks of a clearly racial origin and do not answer the question of fans: will he be a good president? And then we have surveys; they all say that Obama wins and with a great leap.
In this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not according to the brain.
A newspaper from Mississippi, from the ruins of the southern United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the polling booth we know well who gives his voice to the American patriot.
There will be one page of American mentality on the top, which has remained silent until the last moment.
Tell me what you want, we'll finally take care of ourselves if Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear that if Obama was to win, we'd leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
But in spite of all this thinking for the Democrats, the main weapon is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: what mistakes did Bush make during his mandate? eighty-nine percent answered: Iraq.
America's changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and sent him home with a sling to his ass.
In Iraq the lives of 4,500 soldiers were lost, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet Iraq became the majority of Bus' weakness.
Whoever goes to Georgia W will have to do a huge task.
The U.S. Economic collapse has also been felt by journalists: there is a period of investigation in the newspapers, and many blame the internet, the "killer" of the press.
POW Research Center asked five hundred journalists about their status as professionals and the assumption of the future.
Well, today almost all reporters are pessimistic about their future.
However, the questions did not openly say that they were less concerned about confidentiality.
He doesn't feel isolated like he used to.
The problem is for American money journalists, the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of a ruined economic model.
In addition, the gaps in the newsroom, in the rooms where editors work to put the newspapers together, are a huge problem.
According to the reporters questioned, it is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional journalism to change as the general public understands it.
American reporters come forward with a clear, yet complex pessimism.
Six out of ten press journalists and executive seniors are convinced that the journal is on the wrong track.
In the local area, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web goes.
More publishing takes the way to the Internet, which many look at as "killer" prints.
"Economic pressure" to which reporters point out has increased by 79%.
Five hundred of the reporters in question admitted that they deviated from technology in hopes that their newspaper "did something good".
The biggest breakthrough in American journalism is among those who run newsrooms – that means leaders – and reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are certain that their reporters share their values, while at local level the value decreases to 23%.
This has something to do with "security of work."
Leaders who think that losing a job over three years is 47% at national level.
With regard to journalists, they move 30%.
As for "certain work" concerning staff (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on the contract.
In a vast nation like Usa, with three hundred million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, TVs and the Internet employees often offer what they want, and so it's a question to take or leave.
Leaders almost always receive huge payments, and the editor can earn even ten thousand dollars a month outside the payment of pensions and insurance.
As for the permitted, the argument is complicated: a number of days after the first year, a number of days after the third year until the 15 days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, according to their own knowledge, are often sick during the course of one year.
It's just a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: SOUD IN ROMANA, DANILO COOPOL STATE IN GROTTAFERRAT
The President of the Second Criminal Senate of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinauda, decided to refuse to introduce an entrepreneur with the realities of Daniel Coppoly, who requested that he move from his city, Grottaferrats, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in connection with the anti-sale sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial on its own costs, he received a release last week from the domestic prison, which was converted into a forced permanent residence in Grottaferrat.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, asked that the business with reality could change the place of stay from the rural town to the main city.
However, according to the Court of Justice, this move (on which pm was expressed) would allow him to influence his company and to obtain evidence which he was accused of.
Elity in Danger
This event occurred several days ago, when the House of Representatives voted against the saving plan to provide $700 billion to the White House: a large part of the Americans were more interested and interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is confirmed by the New York Times yesterday, which informs us that the current crisis is spreading to the Republican side, constantly more divided among its old East Coast soul, smaller, focused on federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, which is on the contrary conservative, hostile towards "the Washington" and the world of finance, particularly in the states in the middle and south.
A soul that was arrogantly manifested by the vote that I was talking about at the beginning...
However, this just quoted thing is just an example of changes, big changes that the current economic earthquake already shows: not only in the United States, but in the whole West, and perhaps not just here.
Both in Usa and in Europe, it seems that this crisis is acting as an accelerator of phenomena that have been incubated for a long time, which inflame in the new climate and finally come to light.
The first of these is the revitalisation, extraordinary revitalisation of the market, the dual category of State-power in relation to certain renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis is, indeed, a crisis in banking financial institutions, which of course have strong external ties, but in which the budgets of people and families living in one country, in one country, are mostly covered.
This created a political problem for those who run it at the same time: it means how to respond to the problems and protests of people and families, who are beyond the reach of voters.
The short-term crisis is a global economic but politically almost exclusively national one.
The political internationality seems to be largely out of play or to have nothing to add: the obvious evidence gave the European Union, which is always divided as between different interests and different state strategies, and which cannot be decided on for one common policy line.
And so everyone is waiting for the influence of the government of each state, saving plans, revitalizing the market, new rules and especially the distribution of funds: when we get to the press, only the states have economic resources, the amount of financial resources to be able to try to make things right.
And also their own necessary means and powers to use them: two sources of irreplaceable values, under certain circumstances, in which no market and no international organisation will ever be able to have a similar amount.
This new emphasis, which the crisis puts on a state-national element, is still in full line with the growing importance that attempts to align recent economic progress with one factor closely linked to it: territorial ownership.
Paradoxically in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the Kingdom of the Network, ever more sophisticated technology, intellectual, while we were convinced that the world finances were already destined to rule the world, we realized nothing that our future would have to be more and more confronted with such little immaterial things as water, cereals, oil.
All the things that he would say can be moved from one place to another on earth, but in any case, they are connected, absolutely, to restricted space, territory.
So whoever becomes their ruler has a lot more tickets in his hand than he does, and who has the shame of living in a place with no grain, no oil, and no water.
I'm getting to the second newspaper that predicts a break.
Who is talking about territory, state, government, is talking inevitably about politics, that is, leadership.
In view of the economic crisis, it seems that two convergence phenomena are developing.
On the one hand, it is aware that there is an objective need for authoritarian leadership, an application for someone who can understand the situation.
On the other hand, there is a discreditability towards existing leadership, in particular economics, which has proved to be equally inadequate and full of dark places.
Together, something even deeper and in a sense disturbing: discreditation, impatience, feelings of inability and impatience that are trying to control the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
It seems, however, that even more widespread in the vast masses of the population is the belief that their actions are the same as the thoughts of the popular elites so far, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the right sense of the word, that the elite has already exceeded its time and is disgusting to most opinions.
The demand for leadership is short on the ground, but a strong movement for the removal of the ruling classes and traditional political arrangements is reflected in the unresolved election "defences" or unexpected changes in the collective order in the last and most recent period, from the conservative entry into Austria-Bavorska to the fall of the Labourists in Great Britain, to the support of US congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right to do so in Italy).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their formats, they have more problems to understand, so to represent, which, not from today, is created in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is re-enforced, growing, potentially exceeding the cloum.
Before this, it would be too late to talk about a permanent "mass-resistance".
But we certainly can't say that it means having a very open eye.
Super sticky to walk around the walls
To overcome the laws of gravity through super glue and in the future walk through walls like Spiderman.
This is an object of various American research centres, and now the team of four institutions is very close to it.
Scientists have managed to keep the stochylogram body glued to the vertical wall using stickers of only 2.5 centimeters square.
STUDIUM – American journal Science published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, in Akron, the Georgian Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material produced by the team of researchers is the development of existing materials that use a specific structure of carbon called carbon tortoise tubes.
"We can imagine the base of the glue as a series of pipes set up as an organized spaghetti" explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgian Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by the feet of a gekon, covered with microscopic chappies, which allow animals to ensure a perfect landing.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, showed that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the knives of these beaches and at the same time "it is easier to slip away from the wall", explains Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering of Dayton University.
-"This material could be useful as a provisional adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk around here like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers are thinking of far less fascinating use as a combination of electrical devices, because the carbon tubes are heat and energy guides.
Other applications could relate to aerial space engineering .
For the time being, no superhero.
OTHER RESEARCH – Also the University of Berkley, California, is dedicated to researching a new glue.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, California scientists presented a adhesive made of micro fibers as hair that cleans itself from dust moving around the surface to maintain perfect attractiveness.
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription.
Watch out for the grep, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks that are consumed mainly in summer because they are refreshing and full vitamins, together with some life-saving medicines, their use changes to enhance or reduce their effectiveness with serious health effects.
To make David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London highlight the risks of both ready and fresh in combination with the use of some medicines, at the just 263th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, a new blower: just one glass of grape, orange and apple juice to reduce the consumption of some life-saving drugs, to cancel their beneficial effects and expose patients' health to risk.
The flu jus has already been accused of being responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmics, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological drugs to the toxic level.
RISK – The Italian medical agency itself announced this in the newsletter two years ago and expelled doctors and patients so as not to underestimate the dangers arising from this medicine and to take care of what they drink in the event of taking medicines such as Diazepam or methadone.
NEW GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contains substances that kill medicines.
A long list of effects of grapefruit and other juices.
This is where Michele Carruba, director of the Pharmacovigilance Department of the State University of Milan, calls for: "These findings are most immediately reported to the most diverse international and national pharmaceutical agencies, which may set up and exchange information instructions for medicines.
So always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines you receive and if you encounter something unclear, do not get upset, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for an explanation” stressed the expert for Ansa.
Nobel Prize for the Economy of Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his study of commercial models and location of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokenján who teaches at the University of Priceton and is known as the editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important criticisms of Bush's foreign, economic and political actions.
A few months after the assassinations in September 2001, on the days of Enron's execution, Krugman predicted in a comment issued in the New York Times that the second event would be, in the sense of the consequences in the history of the United States, much more important than the first.
A prediction that caused a slight controversy that had been counted to him for years, but proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and shocked at the speed with which the collapsies like Enron and Worldcom disappeared from public interest, Krugman declared at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Binho Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is a "economy of great importance", but also a popularist who has a "very aggressive style, especially critical of Bush's liberal administration's surpluses".
Open Office, we have the third issue of the package "anti-Microsoft"
It is the day of Open Office.org 3.0 issue, an open source package of personal products that aims to penetrate more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the more familiar Microsoft Office.
After about a year's work of volunteer workers controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office shows wide audiences with different news: the welcome screen and the revised and improved opening window are added further, far more important, as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format 1.2, the latest standard version of ISO.
The emphasis is also placed on working with the Office 2007 package, Open Office is able to open the document even with the new Microsoft application (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special features of some models such as what allows to reduce the dimensions of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the possibility to transfer the PDF file to the graphic implementation model and keep the original view of the page.
From this point of view, we can still create "PDF hybrids" documents that resemble typical Adobe format graphics and have the properties of a table processor or text program.
Cooperation is an element that has gained a lot of improvement within application programs: it is excellent to work together between different users and to avoid conflicts of change, in the text programme, each employee is assigned one color to comments in order to be clearer identification in the audit phase.
Some companies are also working on transferring some of the Open Office functions to the Web (on the cloud), and in the following weeks the final outcome should be postponed.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, added to the English version which is on the mirror since Friday.
Besides Windows and Mac OS, the package is usually also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation cd may also be sent to the home or workplace on request.
And if the theme of freeness can be an extension to households, the Open Office package is very well placed in the business area, and can already be counted with the various projects carried out in public administration and in schools.
And there is no shortage of training, consultation and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacement Word; Calc is a table processor that aims to replace Excel; Impress for presentation similar to Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of more famous Access, is a program that allows to work on databases; Draw, at last, is a graphical model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5th million downloads, and when we consider that today we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of a new version, it is possible that this expected number can be exceeded.
Also Kohl results are positive, this is the fourth case of doping
A new positive case on the last Tour de France: it's Bernhard Kohl's Rakušan, from the Gerolsteiner team, a third-class winner and a top top winner shirt.
The report was quoted by the L'Equipe log site.
26th year Kohl is the fourth positive racer on Ceru, the third generation Epo, after italccard Ricco and Leonard Piepoli and the Germans Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl blood samples are among those performed in recent weeks by laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If control analyses confirm the positive on Ceru, Rakušan loses third place on the Tour and will have to face the two years of disqualification.
The report on the positive of Kohl in the third generation confirms the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordy, who announced that he had already informed the outcome of the Austrian government.
The 26th year of Rakušan took place on stage winners after Spanish Carlos Sastrem and American Cadel Evansema, also won a scored trick of the best rider.
IMGRANTS: The new York team is looking for, is it Italian racist?
Italy "as the country of immigrants has only become the primary target of immigrants" adopted with resistance in the last house.
So it's in one long article in the New York Times that devoted this article to the debate on racism in Italy, and started with the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, because he stole a box of dried.
This case illustrates what the New York Times define as "north paradox": the northern areas are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" is registered, but also "the strongest anti-government thinking in the country and the strongest support of the North League".
To confirm the increasing tension between Italy and immigrants, NYT cites cases of intolerance from Milan, Parmy, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not just that.
The new legislation required by the Legou, which seeks to curb immigration and facilitates the removal of illegal immigrants, is cited as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
The trend highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinale, asked that the state and the church work together to defeat racism."
Students for expensive rent - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students doesn't know the crisis.
According to the latest research, Sunia, rental committees, a single room can be rented in Milan up to 900 euros, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"Ev has already achieved such dimensions that the whole class of students lost the right to study due to the overall too high prices that their families would have to bear – explains the leading office for Sunia, Laura Mariani – in this city a large demand from the students has deformed the market in such a way that it has promoted the process of rising prices that has also increased on residences."
In most cases, rental offers contain several offences: contracts in a free way, unregistered, without limited rent, associated with the leases.
For Sunji, an exceptional effort could be made to regulate the prices due to the tax revision.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in the area of Brianza, there is a need for a single bed of about 450 euros, the minimum price of 650 (Bande Nere zone) over the average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) to a maximum of 900 (Vittoria zone).
In Florence there is one bed on average EUR 350/400, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the university, there is a need for 250/280 euros per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single bed.
In Rome, in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), they want approximately 600 euros for a single room, 450 beds in a double room.
Values are slightly lower (550 euros per single year) in areas close to other universities (Ostenses and Cinecittà).
We will save only if we move to peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 per single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and so on.
In Naples, there is a bed of EUR 300/450, a room of EUR 400 to 600, with the highest prices in the areas of Policlinica, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari they want for a bed of 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have a greater impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities such as Perugia, where the most frequent event for students from countries outside the European Union is finally another anomaly: an increase of about 25-30% of the fees they want for foreign students compared to Italians.
Thanks to the old movie Paradise, the cities are ruining the historic halls
Cinematographic historical halls close in favor of Multiplex.
"The city without a movie is like blind, it's like a face without eyes."
The picture offered by director Giuseppe Tornator is a successful documentary of what is happening in large Italian city centers, but also in rural towns.
The process of limiting cinemas, the birth of large multistations in the suburbs and the subsequent destruction of monostations in the central areas of cities is one of the events that seem to be inevitable and irreversible, but it also has all the signs of a genuine cultural crime.
Often the historic places occupied by memories "is as if we had come to a friend, a well-known person with whom we shared a piece of travel and a lot of emotions", feels director of New Paradise, a film that won Tornator Oscar 20 years ago and a great jury prize in Cannes, who explained the poetry of a village cinema and the grief of a way of life that probably lost the cinema forever.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years 316 cinemas of traditional type have been closed, and the highest bill has paid mainly the halls in the most important cities: 10 min in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 min in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions the most affected locks are Emilia-Romagna, with the loss of 82 cinema halls, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And the evidence that their first responsibility is the multiex approach is that these three Italian regions have registered the highest number of new cinemas: 195 are paid more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian procedure has developed in a nationwide way" says Paolo Protti, President Anec, "it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to ensure that those already existing survive, because when one movie closes the city, not all its visitors are willing to move to multiplex.
Then we don't even talk about insufficient funding for operators: the previous state debt is about EUR 10 million.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
It would take between EUR 16 and EUR 18 million a year to support the sector."
An interesting case is the Bolognan case, the first Italian city that is concerned with the closures and which decided to find the eastern sign of the protocol between the municipalities and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in historical centres and in the suburbs.
The planned standards include tax benefits for operators and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: the spectators will be able to travel to a restricted transport zone and will have special parking prices.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna's introduction of other measures."
However, it is certain that in order to be able to face the great power of multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The protection of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important: the closure of the Super Film in Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was a spark that convinced me to set up "New Paradise" which I've been thinking about for 10 years.
I've been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I've been going through before the government or Quirinals in the National Street, where I've shared so much emotion that I don't have to look at the letters of black work, I'm turning on the other side."
Link between politics and mafian group 'andranget, mayor of Gioie Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the election of the city authority according to the interests of the Mafia group Piromelli."
The charges against the Mafia Director in Calabria against the mayor and mayor of Gioie Tauro Giorgi Dal Turrione e Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarn Carl Martelli, who was arrested this morning for external cooperation with the Mafia organization, are difficult.
In the railways too, Gioacchino Piromelli, an old mediator between the clan and public administration, and his grandson, a lawyer, the name of the chief, already accused of committing mafia crimes, sentenced to EUR 10 million.
"They ignored all legal and moral standards, as well as common sense," state representatives wrote, when two local authorities expressed their desire to pay counsellor Piromallim's consultation.
"This would allow the Mafia group – the judges write – to officially enter the city authorities and thus strengthen the scope for control and management of public administration."
The President of the Agazio Loiero Regional Commission of California does not hide that "secret agreements between local institutions and organised criminal sub-worlds are many in his country: "There are areas in which mafia concentration is stronger than in others where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have a lot of local policies that relieve the pressures of 'andrangets, heroes that are still unconfirmed."
This morning 's arrest follows the arrest of July last year , by which the police showed that the Mafian group of Piromelli received a final strike .
Since the end of April last year, the city council of Gioii Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, and the reason for the alleged link between organised crime and local administration has been the local politicians who have been deprived of their functions in general administration.
Giorgio Dal Turrione, President of the Christian Democrats, who was elected at the time of the dissolution by the head of the coalition of the right Wednesday after the narrow election in May.
He screamed about the scandal when Prefecture ordered the General Council to be dissolved.
He called for the responsibility of the former Deputy Minister of Interior Marc Minniti and accused him of setting up everything for political reasons, but the judges in the arrest regulation signed this morning explained that the Mafia Group had even reached so far that she requested a change to the A3 road project.
From the other polls conducted in front of Dal Torrionov, public prosecutors wrote, "the intention was to move the demands of the entrepreneurs, represent some larger groups very close as is generally known, Piromillim and adapt the public administration's choices to the interests of the mafia group."
When the energy comes out of the wave, they get into your big game.
It is an infinite stock which covers more than 70% of the earth's surface and is now being discovered by large world energy companies.
Waves, currents, flow, flow are new sources of inexplicable energy, on which the air of wheels such as Chevron, is now trying to stretch out their hands to these sources.
The possibility of creating energy from sea movements has been studied for over a hundred years and in the 1970s in connection with the first oil crisis has intensified research.
When oil prices fell around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went side by side, but now organic organizations and new oil price increases gave the sector a new boost.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 announced that about 15 percent of the world's electricity consumption could be covered by the use of the wave of the sea.
This quantity would be a double energy that is currently produced in nuclear centres.
In addition, there are currents and flow and flow.
The giants are attacking.
the company that planted the marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 agreed to build the facility in northern Portugal.
When this goal was announced, it seemed a huge revolutionary step.
After two years, which is based on marine energy, there are still more companies that are based on marine energy than traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology – the speaker of a company that is connected to the oil line of the United States, in the economic daily Wall Street Journal – and is thinking about the possibility of working with us."
The cooperation we are considering is about obtaining permission from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary for the deployment of the project for the use of marine energy in Alaska.
We can't underestimate this signal, especially considering that it's the only oil in Alaska that the President Bush has recently come up with a plan for a new return.
In addition to Chevron, they monitor the traces of sea energy i Vertant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and the amounts invested up to now, although not known in detail, they show an increasing interest among observers.
Technology, the keru needs to be developed.
Experts are talking about technology, which is still in the beginning, because they don't know how the use of marine energy will affect the environment.
Meanwhile, facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and it does not seem to cause major problems to the ecosystem.
For greater energy production, however, it is necessary to use technology with a greater impact on the environment.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a color system that is connected to each other.
The force of the wave, which moves with the battles up and down, is changed by using the cylinders and the cylinders on the hydraulic pressure inside of these battles.
The pressure triggers the turbine that supplies energy to the generator.
Energy is delivered on the coast by sea cables.
Meanwhile, in the project phase, there are four devices of this type waiting only for federal approval and part of the energy could serve for military purposes.
On the contrary, Verdant Power is now producing energy for the shopping center and parking space using six pdsea turbines in the New York East River.
The movement of water during the flow and flow causes the rotation of turbines, which, by this rotational movement, is living in the generator.
Verdant said that they have a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorization to use this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the flow.
At this point, special interest deserves the potential of affluence and affluence, says the Institute for Electrical Energy Research.
Although it is an independent factor, the flow and flow are more predictable than the wind, the sun or the wave, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
It is in the energy sector that the New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, have already invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and predicted investment up to 35 million dollars in 2009.
