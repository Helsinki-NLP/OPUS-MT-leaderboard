The members of the Gales Assembly are concerned that they are being taken by the Monk.
Continuation between some of the members of the Assembly, currently called AM, by the suggestion that they should change the name of MWP (Member of the Gales Parliament).
The debate took place on plans to change the name of the assembly by the Gales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from all over the panorama are afraid of being ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party said his group was concerned that the new name "Rima with Twp and Pwp."
For those who don't know Welsh, "twp" means "pump" and "pwp" means "caca."
A member of the Plaid Cymru party showed that the group's set "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Gales conservative said his group kept an "open mind" about the name change, but stressed that from MWP to Muppet there is only a small verbal jump.
In this context, the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced in a similar way to the English word in Yorkshire of the letter "u".
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the amendments, stated: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves."
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 granted the Gales Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals which showed great support for the name of the Gales Parliament.
With regard to the issue of the title of AM, the Commission preferred members of the Gales Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received most of the support in a public consultation.
It seems that the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could result in a headache for the president, Elin Jones, from which he is expected to deliver the bill on changes in a few weeks.
The Law on Reforms will include other changes in the functioning of the assembly, such as the rules on the inability of the AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will get the final vote on what should be called when they discuss legislation.
Macedonians flock to the urns in reference to change the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday if their country's name is changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote will decide to settle a dispute that has lasted for decades with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens took a long time insisting that the name of its North neighbour represents a claim from its territory and repeatedly opposed its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who in the plebiscite opposes the change of name, said he would make an omission of the vote.
However, the rapporteur's advocates, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, maintain that the change of name is no longer the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's camps keep silent while Harlem's churches continue to fight
"The elders I spoke to said that there was once a bar and a church on each corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, neither one thing nor the other."
He said he could understand that the bars would disappear.
"Now people socialize in other ways," he said.
"The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood to which people usually go."
As for the churches, he is afraid that the money from the sale of assets doesn't last as long as the leaders expect, and "before or after they'll be back where they started."
He added that the churches could be replaced by apartments buildings with communities full of owners like people who wouldn't help the neighborhoods remain sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore they will speed up the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that the new owners will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, a metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation changed in the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation was formed next to the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to the streets of 125th Street, a trade street in Harlem that was able to hire and climb to the black people.
A fire produced in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but as the Fragees of Johnson's father made plans to rebuild it, they took care of the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of the father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin, proudly baptized the cartoon as "the campaigns of the poor."
The expert who played the cartoon in July called it another way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also pointed out that it was the first carillon of the world played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who changed it for the largest carillon of the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one took his place in St. Martin.
Those who take care of St. Martin over the past few months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the organ that reigns in parish and which is made up of secular leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing his concern that the latter "is intent on affecting the costs" together, even though it did not participate in the recruitment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some frescoes complained of lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark hits a boy while fishing lobsters in California
The police reported that a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while practicing submarine fishing in search of langotas in California on the first day of the season of that cruise.
The attack occurred just before the 7th of the morning near Beacon's Beach, Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that it was about half an hour walking with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy asking for help with the shouting, when he was born with a group of people to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was only an emotion to fish a langota, but that he soon realized that he was shouting, 'I was upset!
I've been hired!'
Hammel said he noticed when the boy arrived.
"I'll take everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' said Hammel.
The boy was transferred to a helicopter at the Council Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical state.
Unknown type of shark responsible for the attack.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press conference that they would split a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but that they determined it wasn't a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma damage at the top of the tower.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, Casablanca, to Swami's, to Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles observed that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with beauty corridors similar to those of the great stores full of specialist assistants.
As part of the considerable market for the beauty of the United Kingdom, which rises to 2,800 million pounds and continues to grow as fashion sales and household products fall, the biggest racers with beauty products will be tested in 11 shops throughout the country, and then pass to others next year if they are successful.
The investment in beauty is produced at a time when supermarkets seek to fill the booths that on their day occupied televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its offer of beauty products up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current collections of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with exclusive areas similar to those seen in tents like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most of the products are suitable for vegans, something increasingly demanded by the newest customer.
In addition, the perfume shop, The Fragrance Shop, will prove concessions in two Sainsbury's establishments; the first opened in Croydon, not south of London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a change that translates into buying small quantities of food daily in small shops means that supermarkets have to do more to convince people that they visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that the establishments will increasingly appear to commercial centers, as supermarket chains try to compete with discount tents like Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced Argos and Habitat sales points in hundreds of tents, as he bought the two chains two years ago.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernise its pharmaceutical and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but association came to an end after a dispute about how to distribute pharmaceutical revenues in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business consisting of 281 tents in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It was noted that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetic brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 tents.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We transform the image of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained personnel that you can turn to for advice.
Our range of products is designed to adapt to all needs and attractive and practical locations means that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges old shopping habits."
Peter Jones "hot" after Holly Willoughby retired from business of 11 million pounds
The Dragons Den star, Peter Jones, went off "furnished" after the TV show Holly Willoughby retired from a business of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of household clothes and Truly accessories.
His company was compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of this Morning used Instagram to announce his resignation.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragons' Den star, Peter Jones throwing sparks away from his lifestyle brand in the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources indicate that Jones was "furnished" when the television gold girl admitted during a tight meeting held on Saturday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business, valued at 1.5 million pounds, meant that she had no time to devote her to the home clothing brand and accessories of both, True.
The business came to compare with Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, and it was predicted that it would double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, used Instagram to announce that he was leaving True, Jones took a plane to Britain and addressed one of his vacation residences.
One source said, "Truly was different from one of Holly's priorities.
It would be their long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left all the people involved in the project.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a warehouse full of goods in Marlow's offices ready to sell."
Experts believe that the abandonment of this Morning's presenter is among the most profitable stars in Britain could cost the company millions of pounds, due to the considerable investment in products that come from coxines and candles to clothing and textiles for home, and that it could still delay its launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and his husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created True with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined as president in March.
The couple were together on vacation, and Jones had a 40% share in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the ITV I'm to Celebrity program.
A source near Jones declared last night that "We shouldn't comment on his business affairs."
A complicated conversation "and then we fall in love"
He played with the criticisms he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "a few of his own presidents" and for being so positive about the Nordic leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said putting his voice on "telegrapher."
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting held in June in Singapore, which Trump considered a great step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations for denuclearization have stopped.
More than three weights after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's major diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, communicated to the world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see the "responsible" by the United States to the first measures of disarmament in North Korea.
On the contrary, he pointed out, the US continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing to exert pressure.
Trump adopted a much more optimistic vision in his half speech.
"The things with North Korea are going well," he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this excellent relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had positive results: ending tests with missiles, helping free hostages and returning home to the remaining U.S. soldiers.
And he defended his unusual strategy when talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this amphitheatre, we'd have about 200 people standing here," Trump said signaling to the crowd that he was right in front.
An earthquake and tsunami devastated an island in Indonesia leaving hundreds of dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is an indispensable condition for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they made it very clear that they would not ask for international help, so it is a challenge," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear if foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster management agency, has ensured that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute with their help.
Given the constant earthquakes of Indonesia, the country is very badly prepared to face the wrath of nature.
Although in Aceh shelters were built for tsunamis, it is not usual to find them on the other side.
Although an alert was issued, the absence of a tsunami alert siren in Palu likely contributed to the loss of life.
In the best case, traveling among many of the islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was highlighted in Lombok to meet the victims of the earthquake will go to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new calamity.
President Joko Widodo's electoral campaign turned around the improved infrastructures of Indonesia, producing money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is affected by a great lack of funds at the end of next year's re-election.
Mr. Joko is also affected by the continued sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a way of living the most conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were murdered and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes because of the clashes in the streets of Christian and Muslim gangs, who use machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
View: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge marks the goal of the empatt in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League in front of Chelsea with a goal in minutes 89 on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a passage from Xherdan Shaqiri, still about 27 metres from Chelsea's gate with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the ball with his left leg before he fired a shot at the second pole.
The balloon went over the area as it went up to the top left corner of the network.
The ball ended up falling over a Riszabalaga Kepa that jumped in the air and entered the network.
"I was just trying to get to that position, to organize us, and players like Shaq always play the ball as hard as possible, so I tried to make as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"Come near Kante and give me a touch without thinking too much and I just shot."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the rest after the Belgian star Eden Hazard marked in the 25th minute.
The Blues' front-end passed the ball of heels to Mateo Kovacic in that game, before he turned close to the middle of change and ran into the Liverpool field..
Kovacic made a wall in the middle of the field.
He made a beautiful deep passage leading Hazard to the area.
Hazard overcame the defense and ended up in the second suit marking with a gunshot that Alison Becker was unable to stop.
Liverpool is en route to Naples in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do her own thing with Videoton at UEFA Europe League on Thursday afternoon at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths from Indonesia's tsunami increased to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, according to which the national disaster management agency reported Sunday morning.
Many people would be trapped among the ruins of the buildings that came down with the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that took place on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to a press release the spokesman of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with debris from ruined buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old murder suspect after a woman died in a coma
A murder investigation was opened after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 in the morning with white gun wounds on John Street, and was arrested by a 32-year-old suspected of murder.
The police asked the people in the area to see or hear something about it a step forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, 'The investigation is at its initial stage, but I'd like to make a call so that anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street at Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially the taxi drivers, to catch anything with the control camera that comes in contact with us, as they could have key information for our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the body found belonged to a neighbour of Birkenhead who was found within a property.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she was found that morning.
The investigation continues while the police say they're in the process of informing the family of the victim's most close relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that they wouldn't let anyone in or out of the building.
The man ran out of words when he found out what had happened.
Residents have just known they can't come back in within hours.
A police officer has been heard to tell a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
There's a woman on the scene crying.
Don't stop saying 'it'.
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the line with another train just outside.
Several officers remain within the cordon watching the block of apartments.
To anyone who has information, you are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, who calls 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on the 0800 555 111 phone number, quoting the 247 of September 30.
Parliament's Cromwell statue becomes the last monument affected by the struggle to "rewrite the story"
His ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects from England carried out by his fanatic and puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society has qualified Mr. Crick's suggestion to "disappear" and "try to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the withdrawal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace became a target.
The iconoclasty of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
If they had sacrificed Cromwell wrong by the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the opinion that existed in the 19th century, and part of the histography of a figure that many consider to be still worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith declared The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps by the end of the 19th century, that now, as a advocate of parliament before the external pressure, in this case, of course, it was the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a complete representation is the object of a continuous historical debate.
What's clear is that the 17th-century media conflict defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents a side of the division.
Your achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
A killer pig sneaks into a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China.
Last Sunday, South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by his name, "Yuan," was found dead with a blood artery sectioned and covered near a cutlery in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province.
A fat pig prepares to put the vaccines to pigs in a cutlery on May 30th and May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Apparently he traveled with his cousin on Wednesday from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave him another adjacent knife.
He said there was a big man in the cutlery with blood in his mouth.
The forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, almost 250 kilos, attacked the farmer until he killed him.
"My cousin had his legs bleeding and sneezing," said the cousin, called "Wu," to Guiyang Evening News.
The recording of the security camera shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market director told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent anyone from attacking anyone else, while the police gathered evidence on the scene.
It seems that the Yuan family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although they're not very common, there have been cases of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in the farm that the couple had in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a pig of nearly 300 kilos rushed a Welsh farmer against the tractor until his wife arrived and frightened the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs do not usually be aggressive, but that the blood taste can act as "disposer.
"They're just playing.
They're like children, very curious... they don't intend to hurt.
You just have to have the respect you need," he said.
The remains of the Rosa hurricane will bring strong and generalized rains to the southwest of the United States.
Forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa weakens as it crosses the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will take torrential rains north of Mexico and south-west of the United States during the next few days.
At 5 a.m. on Sunday morning, in the east, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds over 135 km/h and was located about 620 kilometers from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a wave begins to take shape on the Pacific Ocean and move east towards the East Coast of the United States. As Rosa reaches the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she will begin to push tropical moisture north, which will penetrate south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical humidity with the valley will create abundant and generalized rains in the south-west in the next few days.
At the local level, precipitations between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous sudden floods, fluctuations and the possibility of land spills in the desert.
The large tropical humidity will cause precipitation that will reach 50 or 75 l/m2 in point areas, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the south-west, rain falls from 50 to 100 l/m2, especially on much of Arizona.
The possibility of sudden flooding with deterioration conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
We strongly advise to venture into the desert under the threat of tropical rain.
The strong rains could form cannons that could become floating rivers, and the electric storms will bring local cold winds and dust.
The valley will bring strong rains locally to parts of the southern coast of California.
Total precipitations could reach more than 12 l/m2, which could in turn cause flow of smaller debris and svardial roads.
These would be the first rains of the region's wet station.
Dispersed tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in the last hours of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain extends at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The rain will reach Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will be a witness of large temperature oscillations in the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic, even though the tropics will remain quite warm.
This sometimes involves significant temperature changes in short distances.
On Sunday we will see a great example of drastic temperature differences in the U.S. center.
There will be a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country, a warm October begins, with temperatures exceeding 26 degrees from the southern plains to the north-east.
New York could reach the 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high probability of temperatures above average to the east of the country during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people followed in six television channels the passionate witnesses of the judge appointed to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political stagnation continues and the chains interrupt their usual programming for a new last Friday: an agreement designed by Senator Arizona, Jeff Flake, for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that he's 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh made his toys drunk and that he tried to get his clothes off at a party at the institute.
In a passionate witness, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely sure that didn't happen.
Nielsen reported Friday that more than 20.4 million people would have seen it.
The company reported the average audience in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other chains that retransmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people watching television from offices.
To make an idea, it's a hearing similar to that of a football final or Oscar's ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which largely supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all chains with an average of 5.69 million spectators during a trial that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial the interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure of Friday on TV.
After the office of the moderate Republican made a statement indicating that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, it was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning by demonstrators when he was trying to enter an elevator on his way to the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He stayed with his eyes down for a few minutes while he was being arrested, televisiond live at CNN.
"I'm here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said, "You have power while there are many defenseless women."
Flake said his office made a Flake statement, before the elevator was closed, he added that he would have more to say in committee hearing.
All television and cable chains were broadcast live in hours after the Judicial Committee had to vote to move forward the appointment of Kavanaugh to the full Senate to submit the vote.
But Flake said it would only do that if the FBI investigated the allegations against the appointed next week, something that called for a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a subsequent conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of playing politics with Brexit
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critic of abandoning the European Union to "play politics" with the future of Britain and to prejudice national interests.
Prime Minister Theresa May arriving at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
Another interview with him on the cover of the paper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, insisted on attacking the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the oranges from the other side was "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims Murdered: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson as a suspect of the LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect from performing the shootings that ended the life of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the LSU (state University of Louisiana).
According to the Baton Rouge Police Department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson, he was arrested and imprisoned for murder in second degree.
Officials released the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims would lose his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the scans from the scene and said they contain Simpson's DNA, as reported by CBS's affiliated channel WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said they admitted to being the author of the shooting that killed Wayde.
The defense reported that he had a US$350,000 loan imposed on him.
East Baton Rouge's Forensics Office issued a preliminary report on Friday that indicates that the cause of death is a bullet wound in the head that reached the neck.
The department commended the state police unit of Louisiana, the state police crime lab, the South University police is to the neighbors for their help in getting the arrest.
LSU's sports director, Joe Alleva, thanked the local command forces for their "silence and search for justice".
Yess was 20 years old.
The 2,01 wing was created in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Its average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 turns.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach, Will Wade, said the team was "suffered" and "smoked" by Wayde's death.
"That's what we worry about all the time," Wade said.
Assassin volcano on Mexico City
The ashes that the Volcano Popocatepetl dropped reached the southern suburbs of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre advised Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after detection of activity in the crater and to record 183 emissions of gas and ashes within 24 hours.
The center was overseeing several storms and tremors.
The images of the social networks showed fine layers of ashes in the parabrises of Mexico City neighborhoods like Joachimilco.
Geophysics have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 kilometres west of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Coping between the police and the Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on the Saturday after pro-independence protesters faced the anti-disruption police and as thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on the secession of Catalonia.
A group of proseparatists masked by the anti-disturbing police, ginding eggs and painting in dust, creating dark clouds in the streets that usually be sheltered by tourists.
There were also later refrigerations that same day with the police, who used the cockroaches to hold the lorries.
For a number of hours, pro-independent groups that co-ordinated "Nor forgotten nor forgiveness" faced unionist protestors who called "Long Life to Spain".
Fourteen people had to be cared for by minor injuries received in the protest, according to the local press.
The tension continues the skin flower in the independent region one year after the referendum of October 1st celebrated by the Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
The voters opted for independence, although the participation was low and the opposition to the secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote at electoral tables throughout the region in violent confrontations.
The pro-independent groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The event also produced but was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who went to the independent demonstration with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia could achieve independence.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they were able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite gaining an adjusted victory, although decisive, in the regional elections of last December, this year the Catalan proindependent parties fought to keep the momentum, with many of their most well-known leaders in self-imposed exile or held in waiting for trial for their participation in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police with his cell phone, said that the conflict was fueled by both gang politicians.
"There's more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial prison since last year, announced that the following year would be presented to the European Parliament in elections.
"Presenting me as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we suffer from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: they arrest a man after a car stops at a house
three men 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car stopped on several occasions against a Londonderry house.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. (flight time in Britain).
The police investigation inspector Bob Blemmings has declared the raid and the building in which the parts were damaged.
It's also possible that a fight against the car was fired at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingstone a 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingstone was won
The uplifting Livingstone surprised the Rangers by taking Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as an instructor of the Ibrox club.
The goal of Dolly Menga was decisive for Gary Holt's team to meet a level that took place after the hibernian, in second place.
Gerrard's team is still out of the house this year at the Premiership and next Sunday they're facing the leader, the Hearts, of which they're separated by eight points.
But sooner the Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Thursday.
However, Livingstone continues to be indicted in the division by the sixth consecutive party; chief coach, Holt, has not yet known the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller with me.
Livingston leaves opportunities in front of weakened visitors
Holt's team had to move far ahead of the time they marked, as with their control they caused all kinds of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened the way but his cross-shoot did not cross the threshold of the gate; then Alan Lithgow's shot came out driven by a Craig Halkett's head from the other side of the gate.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could put visitors at risk in the ball games.
And that's how the decisive goal came.
Rangers gave a free shot and Livingstone made a bag in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined their efforts to fix Menga, who hit the balloon and scored from the center of the area.
At that time, Rangers dominated possession but met with an impenetrable defense that prevented much work from being done by the Guardian Liam Kelly.
That pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced a stop from Kelly.
Rangers' wardrobe, Allan McGregor held a Scott Pittman shot with his feet, and Lithgow sent the ball out of another shot at Livingstone's stop ball.
Many cross-steps in the Livingstone area were produced that were continuously dissipated, while two requests of penalti were rejected: one by hand and one by Halkett's entry to the Glenn Middleton replacement.
"Penomenal" by Livingstone: analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from Tony Macaroni stadium
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingstone.
"And unitedly, they were excellent and still surpassing expectations in their ascending path.
Their game style and players have only changed since he returned to the highest level, but part of the merit is Holt in the way he has driven the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, ran a perfectly organized defense in a proud way, while Menga gave them no breath at all to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
Despite working well on occasions under the order of Gerrard, on this occasion they did not reach that level.
Last pass failed. They only managed to penetrate the host team once. All of a call for the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives an ambiguity in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skys during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to resolve the relationship between NATO's allies.
They abstained on many issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Then Erdogan directed the Colony to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
The city gathers the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police have claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from meeting in front of the mosque, but many Erdogan supporters have come to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning Erdogan's policies as well as the German government's decision to receive them in the country.
The duel of demonstrations reflects the division in front of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocratic by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies when he hits a car
A cyclist died in a collision where a car was surrounded in London.
The accident took place near the cross between the Beswyod Street and Evelyn Street, a transit street in Deptford, on the west coast of the city, around 10:15 a.m. (Summer time in Great Britain).
The car driver stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died in the act.
The accident occurred months after another cyclist died in an accident with a escape on Childers Street in a little over a mile and a half of the accident on Saturday.
The metropolitan police showed that the officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
There are street closures and buses were diverted and recommended to the motorists who avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six officers are injured in disorders
Six prison officers were injured in an altercation in high-security prison, according to the prison officer.
The disturbance began at Worcestershire's HMP Long Lartin around 09:30 (flight time in Britain) on Sunday and still continues.
A "Tronado" unit of specialized officers came to deal with the disturbances, in which eight prisoners are involved who are contained in a pavilion.
Officials received attention for slight injuries in the face.
A prison service spokesman said: "The prison personnel were particularly trained to deal with a continuing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members had to be cared for by injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons and we're clear that the officers will be handed over to the police and could spend more time between bars."
HMP Long Lartin hosts more than 500 prisoners, among them some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was known that the director of the prison center had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-disruption officers had to go to prison to calm down a revolt in which the staff was attacked with ball balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (the places affected by the drought could benefit)
It's rare for tropical depression to affect Arizona, but it's very likely that it will occur early next week, when the remaining energy of the Rosa hurricane passes through the South-west Desert leaving the possibility of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorology Service has already issued sudden flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday of western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, the west of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is hoped that Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and that the last hour of Monday will come with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service reported on Twitter that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of depression or tropical storm on a 320-mile-long radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that spread on a 64-mile radius of Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Meteorology Service provide 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with quantities isolated up to 150l/m2 on the Mogollón Board in Arizona.
Other areas of the South-West Desert, such as the Central Rocks and the Gran Conca could reach 25 or 50 liters, with possible total islands of 100 l/m2.
For those outside the danger of sudden floods, the rain of Rosa could be a blessing, because the region is deeply affected by the droughts.
Although the floods are a very serious problem, some of this rain may be beneficial, as the southwest is experiencing droughts.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme dry, the second largest category," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa will play ground on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who will still have the force of hurricane on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 136 km/h, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north at 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm is finding cold water in the Pacific and therefore losing power.
For this reason it is hoped that it will touch land in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or the night of Monday.
It could rain with great intensity in some areas of Mexico, assuming an important risk of flooding.
"The total precipitation between 75 and 150 l/m2 is expected from Lower California to the north-west of Sonora, and it is possible to meet up to 250 l/m2", reports weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's border the first hour of Tuesday as a tropical depression and then she will continue going up across Arizona and enter south of Utah the last hour of the night of Tuesday.
"The main danger of Rosa or what is left of her is the strong precipitation in Lower California, in the north-west of Sonora and in the South-west Desert of the United States," the National Centre of Furacáns reported.
It is hoped that these rains can cause sudden water drums and spill streams in the deserts, and land spills in mountainous lands.
Aggression in Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder and found a 16-year-old boy with white gun wounds.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, Saturday around 04:00 (flight time in Britain).
He was taken to the hospital, where he stays "stable."
According to Somerset's police, three 17-, 18- and 20-year-old boys were arrested in Radstock's area during the night.
Officials asked for the collaboration of anyone who had a recording on the mobile of the event.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered the mosque and the cholera' of the Democratic Party
"Voice for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the defamatory and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a myth in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "suffered the mosque and the cholera" of the Democratic Party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, where he categorically and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's charge that she assaulted her sexually decades ago, being a teenager.
Ford also testified in the trial on his charge.
The president said Saturday that that day the "United States" were witnesses of Kavanaugh's brilliantness, quality and bravery.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best judges of our times with a history of implicit public service," he said, addressing the crowd of West Virginia admirers.
The president referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh while discussing the importance of the Republican results in the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks are missing for one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don't do it, but I really do," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere fighting for big candidates."
Trump argued that the democratic mission is to "oppose and obstruct".
The first procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh was expected to take place before Friday, as CNN indicated an assistant of the Republican Party.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia cause hundreds of deaths and the number continues to rise
The authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died, many of them dragged by giant waves that broke into the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach of the town of Palu when waves of up to six meters broke down on the ground to the luxury, leading the lives of many and destroying everything to its own pace.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"Yesterday, when the threat came, people were still with their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, so they were relieved," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson of Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB in a prison ring in Iacarta.
"The tsunami didn't just come, pulled cars, trunks, houses, pulled everything it found," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami ran high sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people went up to the trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs spread by the national disaster management agency showed a lot of damaged tents and buildings, torn bridges and broken bridges and a water-round mosque.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was located in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the huge Friday earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's geography, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could magnify the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "quantious" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals and hotels came down.
The bodies of some victims were trapped under the ruins of the ruined buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the victims and the damage could be greater along the northern coast of Palu, a zone called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the seismic.
The communications remained "totally paralyzed and no information" by Dongala, Nugroho added.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a communiqué, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," he said.
The agency was severely criticised on Saturday for not informing about the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, even though officials said the waves would arrive at the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of a fan shared on social networks, you can hear a man lying on the back of a building shouting in a frenzy warning of the arrival of a tsunami to the people on the street.
In a matter of minutes, the water blows against the shoreline leading forward buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to certify the authenticity of the burn immediately.
The seismic and tsunamis caused an important elimination that led to the cut-off of communications throughout Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue tasks.
The authorities claim that the army has already begun sending cargo aircraft from Iacarta and other cities, but the evacuation continues to urgently need food and other basic needs.
The city airport has been reopened but only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit the evacuation centres of Palu on Sunday.
The victim balance of Indonesia's tsunami exceeds 800.
It's terrible.
During the journey that World Vision staff traveled to the city of Palu, where the employees retreated into shelters of wool raised in the courtyard of their office, they contemplated scenes of total destruction, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's terrible.
Even when the groups began the unpleasant task of leaving assistance in the event of a disaster, some complained that they were preventing Paul from travelling to foreign humanitarian workers with great knowledge and experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, funds, supplies and personnel from abroad can only flow if the place of calamity is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the level of a province," said Aulia Arriani, a voice from the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can open up to international help, but it has not yet arrived."
When the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, family and friends of the disappeared ones were caught in the hope that their loved ones were one of the miracles that alleviated the depressing argument of natural disasters."
On Saturday, they took a child out of a dumpster.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, a trainer of the national Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi added that some of the people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were their students.
"As a person with extensive experience in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel among the parapentist community, he desperately tried to send messages from WhatsApp to the competitors of Palu, who were participating in the beach festival
However, only one black mark was shown in the messages instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he added.
Roban $26,750 while reloading a cashier in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, a thief stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who recharged a cashier in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
In the press note, researcher officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car emptied a boxer in the leisure complex and was prepared to deliver more money.
While he was busy, another man came running from behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money he had to deliver.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify how much they were involved in the incident.
If you have any information about your identities, contact the Newport police calling number 859-292-3680.
The Kanye West flag changes its name by Y
The Kanye West breeder changes the name for Y.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "To be previously known as Kanye West."
For some time now, the 41-year-old West has been known to the nickname Ye, which used as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
The change occurred before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to launch its new Yandhi album.
He will replace the singer Ariana Grande in the program, who cancelled her assistance for "emotional reasons", according to the program's creator.
Besides being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously explained that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ti'," said that same year West while talking about his record with the Big Boy radio presenter.
"So I'm you, it's us, it's us.
I passed from Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye, which is a reflection of goodness that is in us, of evil, of confusion, of all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is another of the famous shepherds who changed their name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, even though this year he announced he prefers to call him Love and Brother Love.
An old West collaborator, JAY-Z, also stood up by putting and removing the script and using the capitals.
AMLO undertakes not to use military against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, committed himself not to re-use the military force against the civilian when the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against the students arrives.
López Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that "he would not use the military again to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square killing about 300 people at a time when the student movements were invading all over Latin America.
Lopez Worker promised to support Mexican youth by giving monthly help to the boys who study and open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag boys to criminal gangs.
U.S. should double investment in U.S.
According to the investor and professional of IA Kai-Fu Lee, Google, Microsoft and Apple, U.S. should double the amount you invest in IA in view of China's growing activity in the field.
The comments were made after several parts of the U.S. government made announcements about IA, even though the U.S. lacks a formal strategy about IA.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan the previous year: it aims to be the number 1 in innovation in IA in 2030.
"Duplicate the budget for research in IA would be a good start, since the other countries are far behind the US, and we're looking for the next great advance in IA," Lee said.
Duplicate funding could double the odds that the next IA achievement was made in the United States, Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI SuperPowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Director General of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of the leading Chinese AI companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an IA system that beat American Othello player with higher score and later was executive in Microsoft Research of Google's subsidiary in China.
Lee recognized old U.S. government technology competitions as the robotic challenge of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects and asked when it would be next to help identify the next visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers usually have to work hard to get government bags, Lee says.
"China is not who is taking academic leaders, but companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university geniuses to work in IA.
Lee stressed that changing immigration policy could also help the US to boost its efforts in IA.
"I think they should offer residence cards to doctors in IA," he said.
The Council of State of China published its Plan for the Development of artificial intelligence of a new generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established an artificial intelligence centre that is intended to include industrial and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the selection of the artificial information committee.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2,000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, you've now invested over $100 million a year in research in IA.
Meanwhile, the US legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence does not record movement for months.
Macedonians vote on whether to change the name of the country.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum if they wanted to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a movement that would resolve a dispute with Greece for decades and which blocked applications for admission in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbours represents a claim from its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would prejudice the ethnic identity of the majority of the slave population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the result would reach 50 per cent of the minimum required for the referendum to be valid.
The question contained in the reference paper was: "Is it in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The name change defenders, among them Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying for admission to entities such as the EU or NATO in Macedonia, one of the emerging countries from the fall of Yugoslavia.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said that they would have the result of the vote and that they would have done so definitively.
Change of nine would require a two-thirds majority of parliament.
The State Elections Committee stated that no irregularities were recorded at 1 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters deposited their vote.
"Come and vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old capital voter, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko deposited their vote for the Macedonian referendum on the change of country name that would open the way for his accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents for whom they boycotted the referendum.
"We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do so with our head high and not by the service door," Kavadarkov added.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not accepted as Macedonia, we can go to other countries such as China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO accession will bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate above 20 per cent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of entry into the EU and NATO," Zaev said after depositing his vote.
He said that a positive result would be the "confirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the requirement.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian television chain Telma indicated that 57 per cent of the people consulted planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said I would vote yes.
In order for the reference to be valid, the result has to be 50 percent more than one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first major blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May of the past.
See: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, crosses the whole of Brighton's defense and ends by marking a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took account of Brighton's defence with the Manchester City 2-0 Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously simple to mark the goal of the 65th minute.
The Argentine advance received a passage in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton's defenses before he went to the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
A defense was set up before several more on the edge of Brighton's area.
Next, he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English predecessor used the first toy area to return the balloon to Aguero, who hit the Brighton Mathew Ryan guard with a shot to the right of the network.
"Aguero's going through some trouble on his foot," said the City trainer, Pep Guardiola, to reporters.
"Let's talk about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's when it happened.
We were lucky you marked at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the blues the initial advantage in the front of the Premier League.
That goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the balloon at the depth of Brighton's field at that game.
He sent a beautiful passage to the right-hand side to Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several touches before driving Sterling to the opposite position.
The blues put the ball in the doorpost before they left the field.
The city will face Hoppenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to celebrate the party with the Rockies
With the Nationals outside the fight for elimination, there were not many reasons to force another title.
But a always competitive Scherzer expects to launch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there's still any involvement in the elimination for the Rockies, which brings an advantage party to Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division of the National League.
The Rockies have secured at least one position of the wild with the victory 5-2 on the Nationals Friday night, but they are still trying to close their first division title.
"Although we don't play anything, at least we can play the rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and with the other team would probably be playing at the highest level I've played this year.
Why won't I want to compete in it?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who the opening will be on Sunday, but they seem to be inclined to let Scherzer be what he launches in a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom it would be his start number 34, made another bullpen session on Thursday and will probably launch Sunday on his usual day of rest.
The right of Washington is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump celebrates a half in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding the election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of the outcome in the mid-term elections.
"Let's play everything we did in November.
Five weeks are missing for one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is something big, big... I don't, but I really do, and that's why I'm going to fight for big candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You've already seen this terrible radical group of Democrats, look what's going on now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, evil, and miscarriage.
They don't care who does the damage, over who they have to pass to get the power and control, that's what they want, power and control and we'll never give it to him."
The democratic mission is to oppose and obstruct."
"And they've seen it for the past four days," he said, qualifying the Democrats for "angrily, gullible, disgusting and lying."
He named the Senate Judicial Committee, quoting Senator Diane Feinstein by name, who received strong support from the public.
"Do you read your answer?
Has the document been filtered?
Mmm. Come on, what?
No, mmm, no, wait... it was the worst body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labor Party is no longer so open.
It is not tolerant to those who express their opinion
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, the truth is, I wasn't too surprised.
after all, I am the last of a number of laborers who are not well received, and everything to say to our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because he was faced with decision-making on anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for not being in agreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
on the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, random issues that Jeremy discussed with previous leaders.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday indicated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years I have been a laborer, the committee's meetings on Friday night were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, that is no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "more kind and gentle" policy has been forgotten for a long time, if it ever started.
It is increasingly evident that the laborist party does not tolerate different opinions and is judged if all opinions are acceptable to the party's leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the party, when partners with whom he was going to share a similar political vision began to expect me to stand back and adopt positions with which he would never agree, both on national security and on the EU's single market.
When I speak in public, and actually from a bit of the same thing, there's a tremendous aberration and attacks on the social networks censoring the central policy, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Laborist party.
And I don't care only about myself.
In fact, I know that I'm happier than some of my companions, because the comments that are addressed to me tend to be political.
I'm impressed by the professionalism and determination of the colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist comments every day and who don't give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult were normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with every move of "untrusted" or every change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower in focus.
Over the last few years, I've received a lot of advice that urges me to keep my head down, not to be so frank, and that then "everything would be good for me."
But I didn't put myself in politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party there are 32 still in school, led by the neglect of the Thatcher government that literally let my class fall, I have tried to claim better public services for those who need them, both being local councillor and government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could possibly confuse my political positions, and I do not agree with the party's current leadership.
To those who promoted Friday's motion, the only thing I would say to you is that as the country walks towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I don't understand that desire to waste time and energy questioning my loyalty to the party's leader.
But, in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, whether they are members or not of the party: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no political threat or convenience will deter me from acting as I consider the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: An Invited Ayr Stands in Head
The last two attempts may have changed the final result a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this bitter match of the Tenent's First League.
Now they lead the table and it's the only inviolable team of the ten.
Finally, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the risk-taking, that led the team to victory, and coach Peter Murchie had all the right to be happy.
"So far we've been tested in our party and we're still in doubt, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said, "You must recognize that Ayr has taken advantage of the opportunities better than we have."
The trial at the 14th minute of Grant Anderson, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, handed over to the Warriors, allowed Melrose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot caught a wrong launch.
Climo increased the advantage for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the middle of time, he turned a single shot, leaving the score 17-5 in favour of Ayr at rest.
But Melrose well started the second half and Patrick Anderson's trial, transformed by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
Then there was a prolonged stop due to the serious injury that Ruarid Knott suffered, who left the field on the floor and, from the resumption, Ayr made further progress through a trial by Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
The captain in the function of Ayr, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose went off to have another player with a Bruce Colvine test that was not consumed, at the end of a very pressure period.
However, the local team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for placarding the Climo when he had no balloon, McPjherson scored a trial from the penalty line at the back of Ayr's maul.
Climo marked it, as he almost made it from the resumption, after Kyle Rowe picked up the launch in David Armstrong's area and sent it to Gregor Henry's third line to get the fifth test of the local team.
Still Game player starts a new career in the restoration industry
Still Game star, Ford Kieran, appears to be ready to enter the restaurant industry after discovering that a restaurant company's director has been appointed.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, which writes and co-portiones with his old partner Greg Hemhill.
The two announced that the next nine seasons will be final, and it seems that Kierman plans another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Arigingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, although a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "prosper business" restaurants.
'The sea is ours': internal Bolivia expects the court to go to the Pacific
The sailors watched a shipyard covered with equipment in La Paz.
The public buildings wave a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazons are anchored from the slogan: "The sea is our right.
Getting it is a duty."
In Bolivia without sea, the memory of a lost coast to Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict of resources continues to live, just as the desire to reinvigorate the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps those hopes are at its highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the necessary impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and of course awaits a positive outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see CIX's judgment on giant screens throughout the country with the hope that the Hague Court will pronounce itself in favour of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile will be forced to negotiate Bolivia's concession from a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Indian president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has a lot in play in Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court would give Bolivia a reason, and that it would not change much if that happened.
The United Nations agency, based in the Netherlands, has no power to prosecute Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the CIX judgment comes only six months after the final arguments we heard indicate that the case "was not complicated", says the Chilean expert on international law Paz Zárate.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could be a late one.
"The topic of access to the sea takes a long time blocked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate says.
The charming rhetoric of Morales took away the good will of Chile, I suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume the talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep them after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in Haiti, rejected the idea that the court had made an unusually quick decision.
Monday Bolivia will have "a fantastic opportunity to open a new phase of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, even one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this topic for political purposes.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not take place unless it can trust the United States.
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong declares that his nation will not proceed to nuclear disarmament if he cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This comment is produced at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey seems to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy for more than three decades after the summit with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri claims it is "a utopia" that the continued sanctions and objections of the United States to a declaration ending the Korean War can double the North.
In Washington, they refused to accept the statement without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there's generalized skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris' fashion shows reveal the last line of giant hats that will soon be in the tents.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or well hide completely from the sun, don't look any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne discovered in the gateway a series of extravagance accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that abrased the public with the purest style of the Week of fashion in Paris.
The impossible shadows filled Instagram this summer and these designers took their most surprising creations out to the gateway.
Valentine's main piece was an excessive hat beak adorned with a wide abate imitating feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Among other large-sized accessories there were shoddy sandals, a magic hat and even a pin, but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had their lips sewn and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the tall sewing.
One of the creations seemed to be a complete dive team, with the glasses and the tube, and another a broken ice cone.
And if it's huge fashion, it's lucky.
The fashionable people said that giant heads could reach the tents.
The disproportionate hats come right after the "Bomba", the ball hat with an ab about 60 centimeters that takes the whole world from Rihanna to Emily Ratakowski.
The cult mark behind the impossible hat that invades all the social networks took out another great creation: a beach bag almost as big as the model fitted with a bathroom that carries it.
The orange rafter bag decorated with raffles and finished with a white leather strap, was the outstanding piece of the Spring Summer 2019 collection of Jacquesmus' La Riviera in the Fashion Week of Paris.
The famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I hope that the hats and big beach bags will reach the tents next summer, as the designer had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories'.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the citizens of the world
The private schools in Scotland maintain a history of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding results in the exams, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community materials.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS by their English stamps), strive to offer the best level to students and their parents.
Private schools have the goal of preparing their students for higher education, for the career they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a study plan to measure, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable theme within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that's enough.
But if you talk to him in his own language, he'll reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot depend solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent exams, we can see that the languages are at the top of the table and with the highest approved rates in private schools.
About 68% of students who studied foreign languages received an outstanding education.
Data, compiled from 74 schools that make up SCIS, show that 72% of students received a mandarin grade, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also achieved an outstanding degree.
This shows that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
At present, languages are being given the same consideration as materials such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private and all kinds of school programmes.
A survey carried out by the UK Employment and Training Commission in 2014 indicated that among the lack of language knowledge, 17% of the reasons why employers are costing their vacancies.
So linguistic skills are increasingly essential to prepare youth for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more job opportunities that require languages.
Regardless of the chosen career, learning a second language will have a real advantage in the future with life-long skills like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov among over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language as well as to keep a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a percentage of two digits, in this case 15%.
That's why it's so important to invest in a language for today's children.
Knowing a number of languages, especially those of developing economies, gives children the most opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, teaching languages differ according to school.
Some schools focus on the most classic modern languages, while others rely on languages that are considered more important for the United Kingdom by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of their children, private schools always have several languages to choose and specialist teachers in this field.
Scottish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever their future is.
We cannot deny that at this moment, in a global business environment, languages remain of vital importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence for Scottish youth.
It needs to be done well.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
Lebron begins with Lakers or Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the eveningers who want to see LeBron James playing for the first time with Los Angeles Lakers.
Team trainer, Like Walton, announced that James would play the initial match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still have to decide how many minutes you'll play.
"There will be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell posted on Twitter that James would probably play a few minutes.
After training at the beginning of the week, they asked James for his plans at the time of six Lakers' parties.
At these heights of my career, I don't need pre-emptions to be ready," he said.
Trump's election events come to Virginia on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaigns tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of Trump's five halfs scheduled for next week, including stops in cities like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote on a pause for your candidate to cover the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump intends to get support for the next half-term elections, given that the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump's half in West Virginia and how can you see it online?
Trump's mill in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m. ET.
You can see Trump's half in West Virginia following via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably deal with the matter of the trial held this week for the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense for the allegations of improper sexual conduct and has suspended the Senate's confirmation vote for one week while the FBI investigates.
But the main objective of this series of myths is to help the Republicans face the November elections with a new impetus.
So these five halfs that Trump will give next week are aimed at "dynizing volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important to your agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible to the campaign season," Reuters said a Trump campaign spokesman who preferred not to be appointed.
In the middle of the night, which will be held at Wesbanco Stadium, it could bring together the supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage of the Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
The Saturday will be the second time in a month when Trump visits West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate from West Virginia to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, last in the polls.
"It's not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to come to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows endurance to fight and keep the hope alive to the individual parties of Sunday
After three individual sessions, the foursome of Saturday afternoon might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating pendulum of impulse is a completely invented sport concept but in which athletes really believe, and especially in competitions like this one.
So where would they say the impulse is now?
"They have an advantage of six points and now they're four, so I guess we'll take that as a little impulse," said Jordan Spielth as he left at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four advantages with twelve more in play.
The Americans, Spieth said, feel they have a little wind in their favor and much to be encouraged, among other things, by the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each account with three points four.
Spieth has been lethal from tea to green and is preaching with example.
Those gutural screams were made stronger as he advanced his round, making a crucial putt to embark the fourth party when he and Thomas were two points down after two.
When I got the putt that made them win the 15th, he threw a similar scream, the kind of scream that says he thinks the American team is not out yet.
"You just have to concentrate and worry about your party," Spieth said.
It's the only thing left to these players right now.
18 holes to leave footprints.
The only players with more points than Spielth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup's indisputable story.
The strange but adorable European couple have four and cannot be mistaken.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a crazy Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and not last nine holes Friday morning.
That route, and the way in which it seems to flow its energy to the crowd and from it, confirms them as rivals beating Sunday, and there could not be more popular players to win a victory when the sun is set on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly exposed Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourballs in the morning, when he confronted Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first trip ended with the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole they've never been close to leaving.
But on Sunday, there will be no one to help get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see closely the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the way they can change a strategy in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and they have a significant advantage the last day, but this forum session has also shown that the US Team has a hard fight, something that some, especially Stateside, have doubted.
Europe has an advantage of 10-6 the last day of Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after leaving the fourballs and the foursomes with an advantage of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulties to climb four points to the marker in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who was trying to preserve the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning fourballs, putting the 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more stamina, winning four games, but they couldn't cut the advantage.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from the 12 individual Sunday parties to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novel to win four points followed, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points of the four initial parties in the history of Ryder Cup.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they matched perfection to defeat a disarmed Woods and the American novel Bryson Dechambeau with a more categorical 5&4.
Woods, who fought two parties on Saturday without punishing or glory, showed occasional lightnings of brightness, but now lost 19 of 29 parties in fourballs and foursomes and five follow-up.
Justin Rose, who rested in the morning's furballs, came back to meet his wife Henrik Stenson in the fursoms, winning a defeat in front of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, numbers one and three of the world.
Europe could not always win on a nice day of breeze in southwestern Paris.
The three times champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas fixed the reference point for the Americans getting two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 victory over Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and they won Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 again in the foursomes after they lost the first two holes.
There were only two times in Ryder Cup's history where a team goes up four points in the individual, even though as the current trophie holder, Furyk's team just needs to mount it to keep it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of reach.
North Red says no to unilateral disarmament if you don't trust it
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions had increased his distrust in the United States and that the country would not surrender its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea would take "important steps to show its good will" last year, like stopping nuclear tests and missiles, disarming nuclear testing camps and commiting itself to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we don't see the corresponding answer by the US," he added.
"Without confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament first for us."
While Ri resumed the already known Norwegian complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" denuclearization due to which North Korea would be rewarded as it took action, its declaration seemed important, as it did not reject unilateral denuclearization as happened with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri made reference to a joint statement made by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump on the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed himself to the "denuclearization" of the Korean peninsula while Trump secured North Korea's security.
North Korea has long sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first lay down its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted to relax the harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "unnuclearization first" and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal of coercive success, and even if they oppose the "declaration of the end of war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is an impossible dream, for those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions exacerbate our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader mentioned in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korea leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other part of this topic of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached a dead point."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year's speech when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to attack the United States with Norwegian missiles after the "evil president" Trump called Kim "the man who shot you on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, which last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take action to disarm her, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions should be maintained until North Korea is disnuclearized.
The Trump Wednesday said there was no time for that, and that "it's been two years, three or five months."
China and Russia discuss whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, on Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council that: "The fulfilment of the Security Council's sanctions must continue firmly and without exception until we observe total, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut the funds for Pyongyang nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri on the side of the UN General Assembly and then commented that he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that he had made progress, only a few hours before North Korea complained about him making "mafia requests."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States adopted the "relevant measures".
He pointed out that Kim had told you that the "responsible measures" he requested were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and the advance towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
This year, a new course at Harvard University is making all its students sleep more in order to combat the growth of masquerade culture to study all night inspired by caffeine.
One academic found that university students number one in the world often do not know the basic aspects of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Muller, designed the course, which he believes is the first of this kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact that lack of sleep had on learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl came up and said to me, 'Why do you just tell me this now, in my last year?'
He said no one had told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me," he commented to The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to students the basic aspects of how to acquire good sleep habits helped with academic and athletic performance, as well as improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to present the course after discovering that the students had an important lack of sleep during the week.
The duration course involves a number of interactive tasks.
In a section there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on coffee bowls, curtains, trainers and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deficit affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine in bedtime.
In another section, inform participants how the lack of prolonged sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, brain failure, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe that you have the right to know this information, just as we have the right to know what the health effects are if we choose to smoke tobacco," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride of spending the whole night awake still exists, says, and adds that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students who needed sleep was a growing problem.
Ensure that you sleep enough and that you have a good sleep must be the "secret weapon" of a student to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, signal it. Even avoid getting fat, since sleep deprivation makes the brain enter in induction, which makes you hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physics, helped Professor Cheisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push a course across the campus.
The next step, hopefully, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting up an alarm to lie down, as well as when they wake up. Similarly, it is recommended that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit electronic displays and LED lighting, which can unbalance the circadian rhythm and cause problems to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal to defeat men of Gerrard
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when the Dolly Menga attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disarmed team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingstone.
Ibrox's team wanted to record their first victory at home since the 4-1 triumph in St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach, who left his team at eight points of the Hearts, leader of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the break and a little inspirational alignment of the Rangers never gave the feeling that he was jammed.
While the Rangers went down to the sixth place, Livingstone went up to the third place and is only behind the Hibernate with a goal of difference.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after the Calum Spence line judge had to deal with a wound in his head with the supposed launch of an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that dragged Ayr into the semifinals of Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with the 11th of Livingstone who put a point on the Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way in which his group had suffocated their opponents at all times.
The Rangers may dominate possession, but Livingstone did much more when they had the balloon.
They could have been marked in just two minutes when the short passage of the first time in Menga sent Scott Pittman to the doorway of Allan McGregor, but the central champion wasted this great opportunity.
A powerful free shot by Keaghan Jacobs came to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner, Alan Lithgow, only managed to nail him to the second floor.
The Rangers took control, but it seems they had more hope than conviction about their game in the offensive area.
Alfredo Morelos no doubt felt that they would have asked for a penalty at 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless were shocked, but the arbitrator, Steven Thomson, ignored Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only made two shots at the door in the first half, but the old Ibrox guard Liam Kelly, only had problems with Lassana Coulibally's head end and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While the opening of Livingstone in the 34th minute could have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Rangers failed again in the face of the strong formation of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fitted the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept the cold blood to choose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerard acted on his retirement by changing Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, a change that almost had an immediate effect when the storm made a pass to Morelos, but impotent Kelly ran from his line to block him.
But Livingstone kept devouring visitors by playing exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up a long ball after another.
Holt's team might have extended the advantage in the final moments, but McGregor got up perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow got his head off the corner.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, claimed another penalty when he met Jacobs, but Thomson made the look fat again.
German: Geiger's Inventory
And now a page of our Sunday Morning Sunday Sunday: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and CONTADO... was the day the physical future of Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led him to the device known as Geiger counter.
A peer of science since then, Count Geiger also became a fundamental element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" ("The Crown Camps"), played by those apparently insolvent vacuum scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earpieces, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted by the radioactive activity of minerals."
Evans said, "I'm sure you're crashing now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the defective cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the defective cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immunological system to recognise defective cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of a patient's immune cells, altering them in the laboratory
They can "see" a common protein to various types of cancer and reinject it
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize the defective cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of a patient's immune cells, which change in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein to various types of cancer called HER2 and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "incentives the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the extraction of patients' immune cells and "sensinalas" to deal with cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West boarded a speech for Trump using a MAGA chapter (Make America Great Again) for its appearance in the Saturday Night Live program (SNL).
And the result wasn't good.
During a Saturday night live program, Kanye West was supported in the study after a confusing presentation in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would be presented as a candidate in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he carried a hat from Make America Great Again, he criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times I talk to a white man and say, "How can you like Trump if he's a racist?"
If I were concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the program with a satire staged by Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star was making fun of Brett Kavanaugh's witness to the United States Senate Judicial Committee about the sexual assault demands made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, Chris Rock went up the images of West critique on social networks.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that there had been a bad time in the builders because of their heads.
"They spent time with me in the building.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
I've been intimidated!
And then they said I was going to go," said Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see how I'm going to get my pick?" saying that I'm going to "use my superman hat, because it means you can't tell me what I have to do."
Try with love."
His comments led to apologizing to the audience at least twice, and the members of the SNL list seemed to have been embarrassed, he informed Variety magazine, with the following witness that a person who was there gave the publication: "All the study remained in absolute silence."
They had appointed West as the last substitute for Ariana Grande, whose old boy, the rapist Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left a lot of people perplexing with an interpretation of song I love it ("I love it"), dressed as a water bottle Perrier.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "For one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for making it to MAFIA"
However, the presenter of an interview program, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying that West was simply "to be who he is and that is absolutely wonderful".
"So and all, I chose NOT to reward anyone (buying his music or clothing or supporting his 'art') who I think is embraceing and spreading an ideology that is prejudicial to my community.
It's free.
Just like us," he added.
Before the show, the boss announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it was now "to be officially known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name; he follows Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The Snoop Dogger had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the last legend of music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as Prince.

The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword management role as Jon Snow in the violent fantastic medieval series of HBO Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of machista hero, saying that these roles on the screen translate into what it seems that young people often have to be hard to respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something has failed" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo (#EuTamén).
Kit, who recently married the co-protagonist of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that she felt "very strong" to address the problem.
"Personally, I feel pretty strong right now, what are we wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can partly be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its very male characters.
He continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets; what makes young people feel that they have to be that particular part of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time; how do we change that?
Because, of course, something went wrong with the boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not do any prequela nor sequela of Game of Thrones when the series reaches its end next summer, claiming that "just enough horses and battlefields".
As of November, Kit will play a role in True West (the true West), Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he thought his encounter with his wife, Rose, was the best of Game of Thrones.
"I knew my wife in this program, so somehow she provided me with my future family and my life here ahead," she said.
Rose interpreted Ygritte, the love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the land of Leslie's family heritage in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, the health authorities have declared.
40,000 new cases have been reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which marks a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has been rapidly spread by some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way had been practically reduced to zero, the Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in interim terms, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been discriminated against in China in 1997, but they ensure that discrimination against LGBT people has been extended.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have sexual relations with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that a member of staff is filtered data from the senators of the Republican Party, "hazardous lies" and "conspirating theories"
On Saturday, the US representative, Maxine Waters, denounced the allegations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three senators of the U.S. Republican Party on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were being made by websites and commentators of the "ultradreit".
"Truths, lies, and more infamous lies," said Waters in a Twitter statement.
According to the report, the information disseminated included the private addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill, the headquarters of the U.S. government, during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of improper sexual conduct against the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The filtration appeared shortly after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Puntit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with the Waters department and revealed the information of a Waters staff member, Capitol Hill reported.
"This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and false accusations, was not responsible for any way of filtration of this information.
This baseless charge is totally false and a complete lie."
Waters' statement soon provoked online criticism, including those of the former Press Secretary of the White House, Ari Flescher.
"This nonsense was made angry," wrote Flescher.
"You'll understand that you don't have the temper to be a member of Congress.
When they accuse someone of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't get angry.
It should not be challenging.
You must not question the defendant's motives.
It must remain approachable and serene."
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, to which critics accused him of feeling too angry during the hearing of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who presented himself to disband Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very strongly if it was true," he said on a tweet.
In his statement, Waters said his department warned "the law enforcement authorities and appropriate authorities of these false accusations.
"We will make sure to discover the culprits," he continued, "so that they are legally held responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all and every member of my team."
Johnny English Strikes Again (Johnny English: Again in Action), the peer parody without Rowan Atkinson's power
It is already traditional to look for Brexit's transcendence in new films from a British point of view and it seems that this can be applied to the return of the Franky of this parody and comedy of action by Johnny English, who began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Will the ironic satire be converted into a matter of obviously stupid that we are in the new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent character of Johnny English's eyes and face of rubber renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that this is a general comical creation designed for non-anglographic film territories.
Of course, it's the stupid secret agent who, despite his strafal claims of a daring glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a uncle of Mr. Bean and a piece of that guy who contributed with a single note on the topic of Fire Cars at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics 2012.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's now forgotten television ads, where he sowed chaos at his step.
There's a couple of good times at Johnny English's last date.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while he uses a medieval armor suit and the steps of the rotor make a brief shock against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy jumps into sight, but it gives the impression that humor has little strength and is strangely superfluous, especially when this kind of "serious" movies, like 007 and Unmistakable Mission, are already using comedy convincingly as one of its ingredients.
It seems as if the humor was directed to children instead of adults, and in my opinion, Johnny English's extravagances are not as imaginative or focused as Atkinson's movie jokes when incarnate Bean's character.
Now the permanent topic argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber pirate infiltrates on the network of supersecret web spies in Britain and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, to the distress of the agent who's in service, an unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the culmination of a prime minister of Pompus and conflict, who already suffers a total political impoverishment crisis: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself with this character that almost looks like Theresa May, but you can't do much with the script.
Your infuriate intelligence advisors that, as all active spies were committed, they must get someone out of the retreat.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English as a person, who now works as a professor in some snob institution, but gives extra-official classes about how to become an infiltrated agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the spy academy to a rock school.
They're taking English back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meeting with their old and suffering companion, bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a man married to a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So the Batman and Robin of the misconceptions of the Secret Service of His Majesty return to action, meeting the beautiful fatal woman of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletin.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously subjugated to the charm of the technological multimillionaire charismatic who claims that he can solve British computer problems: the late Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odise of ridiculous falcaturades: ladies' clothes, they light up a bright French restaurant; they create a riot that puts them illegally on board the luxury yacht of Volta; and English provokes total anarchy by trying to use virtual reality helmets to familiarize themselves with the inside of the Volta house.
Obviously, all arrests come out of this last sequence, but in a kind and scandalous way that it is, it seems pulled out of a child television program.
The result is quite regular.
And, as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help thinking: the British film industry can't offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for British workers to work four days a week, but it covers five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will make British work four days a week, but cover for five
The party would like entrepreneurs to pass the savings achieved through the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to workers by offering them an additional day off.
In this way, employees would enjoy a weekend of three days, but would continue to receive the same salary.
The sources say that the idea would be "adjusted" to the party's economic agenda and its plans to attract the country in favour of the workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions supported changes of four days a week as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
An important source of the Labor Party told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen from day to night, but a four-day work week is an ambition that adjusts to the party's approach to balance the economy in favour of the worker, as well as to the party's general industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
Thus and all, the Labour Party currently does not support ambition in its entirety.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said, "A four-day work week does not go into party policy and is not being considered by this party."
The chancellor in the shadow, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference last week to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr.McDonnell said he was determined to recover the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in public service companies.
The plans of the chancellor in the shadow also imply that the current shareholders of the water companies do not recover all their investment, as a laborist government could make "deductions" due to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed the plans to place workers on company councils and create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of the shares of private sector enterprises to employees, which are paying annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy count the "60 minutes" if the FBI's investigation about Kavanaugh could make them change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least one week's final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court. The question is whether the department's findings could influence the Republican senators to withdraw his support.
On Sunday, on the issue of an interview, the reporter of the "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring out something that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy showed up more openly than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said I'd go to the audience, and I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charge came out and asked him if he had done it.
It was firm, determined, rotating."
However, Graham's vote seems unfavourable.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh is determined and would make an explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I know the following: Brett rejected it round," Graham added in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people you mentioned couldn't verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive star poster that will act and an equally impressive mission to end global poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people go to the Great Lawn area of Central Park, not only to enjoy events such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to create awareness of the real objective of the event to end poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the assistant audience had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as making a volunteer, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way to help create awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But what is the degree of success achieved by Global Citizen at 12 years of achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a xenunic way of convincing people to ask for action or is it just another case of so-called "clitivism", people who think that it makes a difference when signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported that it has registered more than 19 million "actions" of its followers, stimulating a set of different goals.
He claims that these actions helped stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to over $37,000 million set to influence the lives of more than 2250 million people before 2030.
In the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements derived from their actions, of which at least $10,000 were already disbursed or recovered.
The group estimates that so far the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a United Kingdom investor and executive society that committed itself to "helping children develop to their maximum potential", with the promise to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, the donors, the national authorities and the supporters of Global Citizens like you, we can turn social injustice of malnutrition into a note on the page of history," the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced funds for the The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website, "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult path and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But in the same way that it happened with the great anti-apartheid movements and in favor of the civil rights that precede us, we will achieve it, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will perform at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to carry out a "block" to hinder Russian energy exports, the US Interior Secretary announced
"If necessary," Washington may use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, including that of the Middle East, revealed the US Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria, especially where the legitimate government is operating, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with the energy in the same way they did it in Eastern Europe," he said, as reported.
Moreover, according to the officer, they have the ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, together with the marine, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke thus addressed the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to deal with Russia and Iran, taking into account that in practice it is the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia consists, more or less, of taking advantage of and replacing fuels," he commented, at the same time referring to Russia, saying that "it has only one tactic" with a hydrocarbon-dependent economy.
Statements were made while Trump's administration was on a mission to boost exports of its natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the most economic option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's administration officials, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unadequate" project of Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into a "cativa" in Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the North Stream oil pipeline 2 of $11 billion, which was set up to double the capacity of the existing oil pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a mere economic project.
Kremlin argued that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is only argued for economic reasons and that it is an example of disloyal competition.
"I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who took place in September in Moscow.
The US position received Germany's reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry leader, the Federation of German Industries (BDI, for its German stamps), urged the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, BDI president, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine his candidacy to the presidency in 2020, said Senator de Massachusetts
On Saturday, Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said he would carefully examine his candidacy among the mid-term elections.
During a public assembly in Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair the broken government and that includes a woman in power," he said, according to The Hill.
"On November 6, I will carefully examine my candidacy to the presidency."
Warren felt about President Donald Trump during the public assembly, claiming that he was taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was frank in his criticisms to Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren commented on a tweet "of course an FBI investigation is required before the vote."
However, in a survey published on Thursday, it was shown that most of Warren's own voters do not believe that it will be presented in 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said that the senator would not submit his candidacy, according to a poll by Suffolk University Political Research Centre and Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The investigation showed more support for the candidacy of the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent names of the Democrats in connection with a possible candidacy in 2020 include the former vice president, Joe Biden, and the senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide it before January, he informed the Associated Press agency.
Sarah Palin cites the post-traumatic stress disorder (TEPT) of Track Palin in the middle of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September
On Monday night, they arrested and accused of an incident of domestic violence
"With what my own son is going through, with which he's going through again, I can see myself reflected in other families who feel the consequences of the TEPT and some of the wounds with which our soldiers return," explained the audience in a half of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said his arrest was a taboo theme and that his son and other war veterans "are becoming different, hardened, wondering if there is any reason why the militia and airmen, as well as other members of the army, offered the country."
They arrested him on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused him of domestic violence against a woman, which interfered with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon at the same time as he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and Columbia District Challenges New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia District support a judicial remedy for a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, representatives of 18 states and the district submitted a friendly report from the court in Washington to support an asylum-seeker who challenged politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant part of the Grace Sessions price v. that the American Civil Liberties Union (United States of the Civil Liberties Union) presented in August did not reveal itself against the federal policy.
He told her that her "and her children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but the US officials refused her asylum application on July 20.
Detrived Texas.
The state lawyers who support Grace described O Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum-seekers for the United States, such as nations that face generalized problems with criminal organizations and related domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy withdrew a 2014 decision from the Board of Immigration Appeals (Immigrant Appeals Council) which allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be adjusted according to the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and that prohibition violates that principle" was explained in the court's friendly report.
The prosecutors continued to debate in the report that the policy that rejects the entry of immigrants harms the US economy, explaining that it is likely that they become entrepreneurs and that they "provide labour".
In June, the general prosecutor, Jeff Sessions, ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims who were victims of domestic abuse and violence by criminal organizations.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions declared in their policy announcement on 11 June.
The asylum has never been designed to alleviate all the problems (including all the serious problems) people face every day around the world.
Rescue efforts desperate in Palu as the number of victims doubles in a career to find survivors
For survivors, the situation got worse and worse.
"The circumstances are very tense," says Risa Kusuma's 35-year-old mother, comforting her febrile baby at the city's evacuation center in Palu.
"Every minute comes an ambulance with bodies.
And clean water is scarce."
The residents were seen returning to their ruined houses, collecting their stolen property, trying to save anything they found.
There are hundreds of injured people and hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are flooded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Harris, who broke the back and shoulder, rest outside the Palu Military Hospital, where the patients were treated in the open air due to continuous and strong replicas.
The tears filled her eyes as she explained how she felt that the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor that she shared with her wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall smashed me, I think," Harris told the Associated Press, and added that his family was in a wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife ask for help and then just shut up.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of committing abuse with "propagandistic ads"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper preaching the benefits of trade between the US and China, U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of serving the US press to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, referred to China Daily's payment supplement at the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of going to the U.S. Congress elections, which will be held on November 6, because China denies.
Trump's accusation that Pequin was trying to get involved in the U.S. elections, marked what the officials of that country had called Reuters as a new phase of a growing Washington campaign to coerce China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a growing trade war testify to the level of tariffs in their respective imports.
According to Chinese and US experts, the Chinese countervailing tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were designed to harm state exporters like Iowa, which supports the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of China's main exporters of agricultural products, said Pequín was harmful to workers, farmers and US entrepreneurs.
In an article written by Branstad and published in the issue of the Sunday of the Moines Register, China "is intensifying this campaign of harassment by broadcasting propaganda ads in the free American press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of the appreciated American tradition of freedom of expression and press by publishing a payment notice at the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the post of newspapers located at the end of this street in Beijing, there are few dissident voices and there is no real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese may have on China's worrying economic path, as the media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he adds.
Even so, he says that "one of China's most important journals has declined the offer to publish" his article, although he has not confirmed that it is a newspaper.
Kavanaugh's disaster has lost the female Republican vote for a few days from the mid-term elections
Although many of the major Republicans support and defend Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, despite the various allegations of sexual assaults, analysts warn of a violent reaction, especially of female voters, in the next half-term elections.
The reactions around these accusations were numerous and most Republicans were positioned to proceed with the vote.
"These things can't be undone," said Grant Reeher, professor of political sciences at the Maxwell University of Syracuse School in an article published on Sunday at The Hill.
Reeher also claimed that the last hour of Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm the spirits of angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it in the near future nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national spokesman for the MoveOn progressive group in the Washington Journal, D.C.
On Friday morning, the opponents, at the flu of "Acercase November!", appeared in the Senate corridor, while the Republicans, under the control of the Judicial Committee, decided to proceed with the appointment of Kavanaugh, despite the witness of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, told Mic.
"The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democrats will overcome any expectations," said a neutral political analyst at the news site Stu Rothenberg.
"It is true that it is already high,
But it's going to be even more so, especially among the indecisive voters of the neighborhoods or those between 18 and 29 years old, who, although they don't like the President, don't usually go to the urns."
Before Ford's public witness detailed his charges of sexual assault against the Supreme Court's candidates, analysts suggested that it would be possible to have a violent reaction if the Republicans continued to confirm.
"This has become a disaster for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, president of the National Republican Committee, at the beginning of the week on the NBC News channel.
"This goes beyond the vote of the committee, of the final vote, or if Kavanaugh will sit in the bank of the accused or not. The problem is how the Republicans managed this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, who helps the election of the Democrats in the news channel.
However, it seems that the Americans are divided between believing the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh, even though they are more inclined to support this latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of the surveyed people believe that Ford's witness is entirely or probably in front of 35% that supports Kavanaugh's witness.
In addition, a 38% believe that the most likely is that Kavanaugh lied during his witness, in front of a 30% who thinks the same thing about Ford.
With the pressure exerted by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford, as well as those of at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified to the Senate Judicial Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked in a state of marriage when he was 17 years old.
On the other hand, Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court showed him the genitals at a university party when he was studying in Yale in the '80s.
World Wide Web Creator wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the last project of this technology legend, is a solid-based company, Berners-Lee's open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people can access that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee was lucky to have the intention of hiding Inrupt is "dominating the world".
"We have to do it," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "on-line personal data store" or POD.
Contact lists, to-dos, calendars, music and other personal and professional tools can be included.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in a single browser at the same time.
All this makes this personal data store unique is that the user has complete control over who can access that information.
The company defines this as a "personal power through the data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to its president John Bruce, is that the company provides adequate resources, processes and skills to help solid be available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security company owned by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, developers from around the world could create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that neither he nor his team spoke with "Facebook nor Google about entering or not a complete change that would change their business models from day to day.
"We don't need your permission."
In an article published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of a new solid-based website."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when establishing the World Wide Web Consortium community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has stood up as an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee continues to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic with this new web era," said Berners-Lee.
Mention to Bernard Vann, a clergyman decorated with the Victory Cross in World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who was decorated with the Victorian Cross during World War I received a posthumous tribute in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was won on September 29, 1918, in the attack of Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was murdered by a sniper four days later without knowing that he was granted the highest British military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were responsible for discovering a memorial in his honor at a show in Rushden (Northamptonshire).
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after his grandfather's fascination with his title.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann addressed his battalion through the Saint Quentin channel "through a dense fog and under the yoke of an intense fire of subways".
Later he hurried to get to the fire line and, with a "great courage," directed the line forward before hurrying with a cannon and no one's help, and throwing three people out of the enemy's detachment.
Lieutenant Vann was murdered by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions are "something he could never live with, but a lesson like that."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a crown of flowers after the parade, which led to the youth band Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to participate in the show" and added that "the value of this genius hero shows him the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig cut the list to MMA fans at the best time
Imagine that you've been taking all night smart to enjoy Bellator 206's full show, and when you get to the best of it, something's stopping you.
San Jose's cartel included 13 fights, being six main ones, and was streaming live in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
But on the 6th of the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald saw the faces, the UK's viewers were perplexing when they saw Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after having spent so many hours waiting to see the struggle.
A fan described the change to these childish drawings on Twitter as "a joke of very bad taste."
"The state legislation ruled that this content was not appropriate for the 6th of the morning, and that is why it had to change to child programming," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Marketing and Bellator Communication vice president, when he was asked for the re-transmission.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that they will take into account UK viewers in future programming.
"I think we'll be able to solve it when we think about the repetition," said Coker.
"But if it's 6:00 in the morning there, we can't solve it until Sunday, which will be Monday for them.
But we're working to find a solution.
When the change occurred, I began to receive many messages and not all were pleasant.
We were trying to solve it because we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're going to limit ourselves to five fights instead of six.
I'm very angry."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior due to her sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic jumper, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this made him find the motivation to triumph.
This 24-year-old athlete says he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he got to the institute.
Invited to the first edition of the Desert Island Radio 4 Discs program led by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he began talking about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a parent helped him to relativize the importance of winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual presenter of this program, is low by illness.
As a guest of the first Laverne-led program, Daley shared that she felt "low" to the rest of the people because "it wasn't socially acceptable that you liked children and girls."
He even said, "To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different is what moved me and gave me the strength needed to achieve success."
I wanted to prove that it was "someone" so that people wouldn't feel disappointed when they discovered their sexuality.
With two bronze Olympic medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance in Australia's Commonwealth games to ask more countries to depise homosexuality.
He decided to speak because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly and without fear of the consequences, and wanted to give hope to others.
The world's three-time champion said to fall in love with US director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "it was all a surprise."
Daley married this winner of a Oscar last year and said that the 20-year difference between them was never a problem.
"When you live in such a short time" (with only 14 years of age he first participated in Olympics and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone of your age who experienced similar highlands.
The couple had their first son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth made Daley completely change his perspective.
"If you asked me last year, my greatest motivation would be to win a gold medal," he says.
"But now I know there are much more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
To me, my medal is Robbie."
His son takes his father Robert's name, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
Daley's father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked his son to do was enter London in 2012, he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell you that I wouldn't be here to occupy that first row," Daley said.
"He was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and was at that exact moment, at the moment of his death, when I realized that he was not really invincible," he added.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that was the dream of my life: jumping in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympics, there was no better feeling" confirmed.
The choice of Heather Small's Proud song is not in vain either, as it's the melody that accompanied him during his preparations for the Olympics and still put his hair on his head.

A Mickelson in low shape ended up in Ryder Cup bank this Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to improve his technique so that this doesn't become an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who participates in the biennial event for the 12th time, stayed in the bank by decision of Captain Jim Furyk and was unable to participate in the fourballs or the foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action, as many other times for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day encouraging and working to improve his movements.
Although it was never the most precise of players, nor even at the peak of their career, at their 48 years of age, it did not fit in the adjusted Le Golf National field, where the tall grass usually punished the wrong shootings.
And if this wasn't enough, Mickelson got enlisted on Sunday's ninth match at the precise Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games this week.
If the Americans, four points below the beginning of the 12 individual parties, begin with a good footing, Mikkelson's action could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk trusted his husband, though he could not say much more.
"He understood perfectly the role he played today, gave me a palm in his shoulder, passed my arm and told me that tomorrow he would be ready," Furyk said.
"I fully trusted in myself.
It has a prominent place in the Fam Hall and has contributed a lot to the teams last week and this week.
I probably hadn't thought I'd played two games.
I thought I'd play more, but eventually it's the way things are, and so we think it should be.
Like everyone else, he wants to be out there."
Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record in the largest number of games played at Ryder Cup.
I could mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup, a career that never reached the level of his individual palm trees.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven halvs, although Furyk says his presence also provides untenable to the team.
"He's a funny, sarcastic person, he's enchanted and he likes to get in with people, he's a good guy to have on the team," he explained.
"I like to see the good that the younger players spent with him this week.
It's much more with a good player."
The Captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, is afraid of the disappearance of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the last day of individual Ryder Cup can easily become an uncomfortable journey.
The Great Danes started in 1997 in a party in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but they ended up reaching the finish line with a minimum advantage winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You still think we had a great advantage in Valderrama; just like in Brookline, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won a little," Bjorn, in the photo, reflects, after seeing the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 on Le Golf National.
History shows that this isn't over yet.
Tomorrow we have to go for everyone.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This does not end until the points are in the bookmark.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on it.
I'm not tired of saying it, I'm focused on our 12 players on our side, but I'm also very aware of what's on the other side: the best players in the world."
Enthralled by the performance of his players in a hard golf course, Bjorn added, "I would never sing victory before.
Tomorrow we face another beast.
Tomorrow is the day of individual performances, and there we also have to prove our worth.
It's great to be with a companion next door when things go well, but when you face things individually, then try your ability as a golfer.
That's the message you need to convey to the players, who get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will find that his players have a better individual performance than their companions, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points of four.
Furyk himself was in both two extremes of those rounds of the last day, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn, but ending up as a loser in the European miracle in Medina."
"I remember each of the damn words," he answered when he was asked if he remembered as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, gathered the players face-to-face the last day.
"We have 12 important parties, but you'd like to have a quick start like Brookline's or Medina's.
When you see the impulse going in a direction, there's a lot of pressure in those intermediate games.
We prepare our alignment by taking this into account and putting the players as we thought, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the fight and confront Rory McIlroy in the first match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the upper half of the ranking.
"I decided this order because I think it covers the whole way," Bjorn explained about his selection for individuals.
The new German warship once again
The German Army's newest fracture should have been delivered in 2014, to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but it will not reach at least next year due to defective systems and increasing costs, local media reported.
The position in service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leader ship of the famous Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was adjourned until the first semester of 2019, according to a military spokesman to Die Zeit.
The ship should have been incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but subsequent delivery problems affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships, which the Army commissioned in 2007, will replace the former Bremen class fractures.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, with different anti-hero missiles and anti-bullet missiles, as well as with hiding technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to unravel the newer fractures up to two years outside the source ports.
However, as Die Zeit well points out, these continuing delays mean that warships with the latest technology, and that they will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be old-fashioned when they enter service.
The unfortunate F125 was news last year, when the German Army officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss station in Hamburg.
It was the first time that Marina returned a ship to a builder after the delivery.
He knew little about the reasons behind this return, but the German media spoke of "critical defects in software and hardware" that made it impossible to use the warship in a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half the staff needed in the old Bremen class fractures.
In addition, it was discovered that the ship had a dramatic excess of weight, which reduces its performance and limits the capacity of the Navy to add improvements in the future.
The Rhineland-Pfalz of 7,000 tons is thought to weigh twice as much as the similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the project's total cost, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that the amazing amount of EUR 3100 million is already reached, compared with the initial 2200 million.
The problems of the newest fractures are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that German naval power is making water.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy is staying without ships fit to unload.
The officer claims that this problem is growing, since the old ships have been withdrawn, but not replaced by others.
Even so, he regretted that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg's fractures could join the Navy.
National Trust spys on the secret life of the bats
A new research that is being carried out in a Scottish Highlands firm is about to reveal how the bats use the landscape to look for food.
Results are expected to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland Association will follow the Pypistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus as well as the Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in the Inverewe gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor the activities of the pieces during the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys with manual detectors.
A sound analysis performed by experts from all recordings will determine the frequency of the calls of the pieces and that is being done by each species.
A habitat map will then be developed to create a detailed picture of the landscape scale of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Consultant, hopes that the results show that habitat areas are more important to bats and how they use each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and what is the best way to keep forests for bats and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have decreased considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by works of construction and development affecting children and loss of habitat.
Aerogenerators and alumina also pose a risk, as well as mosquito traps, some chemical treatments of building materials and domestic cat attacks.
The bats aren't blind,
But because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They use sophisticated ecolocation techniques to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land all over the country, takes the pieces very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who carry out periodic surveys, inspection of children and, at times, even rescues.
The organization even has the only and first reservation of bites from Scotland in Thrave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bites from Scotland.
David Thompson, State Manager, says this is the ideal territory for them.
"In Treve we have a great area for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, historic trees and a wonderful habitat.
But there are many things we still don't know about the pieces, so the work we're doing here and other properties will help us understand better what they need to prosper."
It stresses the importance of controlling the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance tasks in the property, as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single child of maternity can kill up to 400 females and females, which could eliminate a whole local population.
The bites are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them, as well as destroy their children.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish staff member of the Bat Conservation Trust organization, encourages people to help:
"There's still a lot left to learn about the bites and, in the case of many species, we don't know how it's going to its populations."
Ronaldo rejects the demands for rape and his lawyers will be prepared to demand German publication
Christian Ronaldo qualifys the allegations of rape against him as false, claiming that the only thing people want is to get to know each other using his name.
Your lawyers will ask the German magazine Der Spiegel to publish these accusations.
Portugal's and Youth's predecessor was accused of violating Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It's claimed that the football player paid the woman $375 000 so she wouldn't say anything about the incident, Der Spiegel published on Friday.
Hours after his publication, Ronaldo, 33 years old, caught this false news in a live video from his Instagram account, which accounts for 142 million followers.
"No, not a thousand times no.
What was said today is false," he told the camera five times the winner of the Golden Ball.
"People want to get to know themselves using my name.
It's normal,
They want to be famous just by saying my name, it's part of my job.
I'm a happy and respectful man," the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers will prepare to sue Der Spiegel for the accusations, which they qualify as "an unacceptable statement of suspicion in the area of privacy" according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would claim compensation for "moral damage for an amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident would have occurred in June 2019 in a suite at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga would have returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anonymously, according to the documents presented at the Clark County District Court.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, was bent on saying that he was a 99% knight, but that 1% betrayed him.
The documents ensure that Ronaldo confirms that they both maintained sexual relations with each other.
Mayorga also maintains that she went to the police and that she had photos of the wounded, but later she came to an extrajudicial agreement because she was terrified of the reprisals and worried about the public.
The 34-year-old woman said she wanted to withdraw the agreement while continuing to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet with the Royal Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer incorporated the Italian giant Juve into a 100 million-euro deal.
Brexit: Automobile manufacturers would leave the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom would regret forever the loss of its position as world car manufacturing leader in Brexit, according to business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is worrying that Toyota UK would say to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production of its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"It's necessary to reach an agreement," Clark added.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that if Brexit did not reach any agreement, the impact of the delays on the border could cost jobs.
The plant of Burnaston, responsible for the production of the models Auris and Avensis of Toyota, produced around 150 000 vehicles last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the EU.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will be witnesses of how production stops in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director General of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers also expressed their fear of leaving the EU without reaching an agreement on the functioning of border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that he would close his mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the risk of the subsidiary chain in the event of a failure to reach an agreement in Brexit.
The production line of Toyota is very adjusted, and every 37 minutes pieces of UK and EU car suppliers come to measure.
If, on 29 March, the United Kingdom leaves the EU without reaching an agreement, the border could be affected and delays and scarcity of pieces could be generated.
The company claims that it would be impossible for Toyota to keep a normal pace for more than a day at the plant of Derbyshire, so production would have to stop.
Clark states that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "calibrated precisely to avoid such conflicts at the border."
"It is essential to have an agreement, and we want it to be the best agreement, so that we can enjoy the current success, but also take advantage of this opportunity," said Today's BBC Radio 4.
"The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent chain of sub-minister."
Toyota could not estimate how long production would be stopped, but warned that in the long term added costs would reduce plant competition and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, an employee of Burnaston for 24 years and a union coordinator of Unite, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "By experience, I know that once these jobs disappear, they never return.
A government spokesman said they presented a precise and critical plan for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could get back together.
The White House has stated that Donald Trump's high-risk meeting and Rosenstein's justice sub-secretary could be delayed one more week due to the fight by the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Russia's assistants and Trump, and the possible impediment to justice by the president.
If Trump fired the attached general prosecutor, as if he didn't, which would put Mueller's independence at risk, he fed the rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke of using a microphone to record talks with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the President through the 25th amendment.
However, Rosenstein rejected the report.
But last Monday he came to the White House, among reports that indicated he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not have to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a shock at the Senate's judicial committee hearing that Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of improper sexual conduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation into the FBI's complaints against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared in Fox News Sunday.
In response to the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "There is not yet a fixed date, it could be this week or a further week, given that everything is going on in the Supreme Court.
We'll see, but you know I like the press being informed."
Some journalists have questioned that statement, since Sanders has been taking since September 10th without holding a press conference.
When presenter Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders claimed that the lack of an information session was not due to an aversion to reporters' greatness, although he added that it would not be her who denies that attitude.
You also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president grants more interviews than the previous president," he said, although he did not quote any sources that would leak those data.
They will continue to hold briefings, said Sanders, but insisted that "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the President of the United States, that is much better than addressing the questions to her.
You're witnesses of how we've been doing this over the last few weeks, and that's gonna replace a press round where you can talk directly to the president of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
However, solo press conferences are scarce.
Perhaps the president showed the reason this week in New York, with a free appearance and on strange occasions in front of the assembled journalists.
A letter from the Ministry of Health to calm the spirits in front of Brexit
The Health Secretariat addressed a letter to EU workers in Scotland's NHS expressing the country's gratitude and communicating their wish to remain in the country through Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter within six months of the United Kingdom leaving the EU.
The Scottish government has undertaken to cover the cost of requests for status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on abandonment continued, and it is planned to reach the decisions this autumn.
However, the UK government, for its part, also intensified its preparations for a possible situation of disagreement.
I know this is a period of concern for everyone.
That is why I want to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
The partners of the European Union, and above all, provide an indisputable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us."
Christian Abercrombie submitted to an emergency surgery after a head injury
Christian Abercrombie, linebacker of Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during the defeat of the Saturday (31-27) in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State trainer, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
Apparently, he was disappointed when he got to the band line.
The trainers and the medical staff gave him oxygen on the band line before taking him on a camel to do a later evaluation.
A Tennessee State technician reported to Chris Harris, a WSMV journalist in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Even so, he added that there are still no details of the type or scope of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to discover when that injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year red shirt student, is in her first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five entries in total on Saturday before leaving the game, which raised to 18 his total season.
A stamp tax will be applied to foreign buyers who purchase a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. This extra money will be used to help people without going home under the new conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of the Corbyn campaign to attract young voters
The increase in seal tax will apply to people who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will charge a higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom. Theresa May will announce that this extra money will be used to help homeless people.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more accessible housing and focus on people with high incomes.
The increase in stamp tax will apply to persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the money collected will serve to support the Government's campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping on the street.
The charge, which is added to the current seal tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second homes and the purchases to rent, may be up to 3 %.
Feenda hopes that the change will reach 120 million pounds a year.
About 13% of the new constructions carried out in London are marketed by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which is causing an increase in prices and making it difficult for people who want to buy a house for the first time to have more difficulty accessing the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "paltsma cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers that spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy is applied just weeks after Boris Johnson was asked to apply for a cut in the stock transfer tax to help new people acquire their first home.
He accused the great builders of keeping the prices of high housing by buying land and not using it, and urged Mrs. May to eliminate the percentages of tax revenues on moderate price houses to fix the "hungry of the housing sector" that is living in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposals for housing-related reforms, including the control of tenants and the prohibition of defamation in which the tenant is innocent.
He also wants to grant the councils greater powers when building new homes.
Mrs. May said, "Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And for that it is necessary to fix the disastrous housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to what you want to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not fair that it is as simple for those who do not live in the United Kingdom, as for companies based abroad, to buy housing as for British workers.
For too many people, the dream of being the owner of a house is too far, and the indignity that is supposed not to have a roof continues to be too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to train Scotland."
Sunderland's manager, Jack Ross, said his "last ambition" was to become the Scotland selector at some point.
This 42-year-old Scotch is enjoying the challenge of reviving the Northwest Club, which currently occupies the third square in League One, at three points away from the head.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"When I was a player my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in selection B, and that's all," Ross told the BBC Scotland Sports Sound program.
"I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden many times with my father when I was a child, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in running a club."
Among Ross' predecessors at Sunderland's training station are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he has not felt any concern about these so-consolidated figures in such a large club after rejecting previously proposed Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Will success for me depend at this time if I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the structure and facilities of the club are undoubtedly own by a Premier League club," he said.
"It won't be a simple task to come, but it's likely that you just think I've made it here if I can return the club to the Premier."
Ross only takes three years as a trainer after a period of assistance in Dumbarton and a period of 15 months within the technical staff of the Hearts.
In that period it helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and made St. Mirren stop to go down and win the Championship title next season.
Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than he ever found during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"I probably found myself in a real crossroads," he recalled, about taking over Alloa.
"I really thought training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds weird because I didn't feel bad, I made a reasonable living, and I enjoyed some success.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I continue to suffer from stress and work pressure, but I like training.
I've always liked training and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life."

According to one survey, the perfect time to take a painting is 5:30 a.m.
Summer heat wave increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulties, but it put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced an increase of 2.7 per cent during July, but consumption in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent according to the figures.
Peter Martin, a member of the CGA's commercial advisory board, in charge of compiling the figures, said: "The winter days and England's stay in the world of football for longer than expected led to a pattern similar to that of June in July, in which the pubs enjoyed an increase of 2.8 percent in consumption, although the restaurants suffered an even greater punishment.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the business volume of restaurants during June increased during July.
Pubs and drinking bars were the best results obtained with higher consumption increases than the reductions experienced by restaurants.
Food-specialized pubs also suffered the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
It looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars controlled drinking increased by 6.6 per cent during the month, and food consumption decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, employed by the RSM company for the analysis of leisure and hospitality activities, said: "These results suggest a continuation of the trend that has been taking place since the end of April.
The time and impact of the main social and sporting events continue to be the main factors in relation to consumption outside the home.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to suffer, however, a 4.8 percent drop per annum will be particularly painful if you add the constant increase in costs.
The warm and long summer could not have arrived at a worse time for the restoration business and time will be responsible for whether the temperature moderation experienced during August will provide the necessary breathing for the sector."
The total growth of sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent during July, reflecting the acceleration in brand launches.
The Buyer Box Peach Tracker Industry sales indicator of the UK pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operating groups with a total profit of over 9,000 million pounds and is considered the sector's benchmark.
One of every five children has accounts of secret social networks that hide to their parents
One out of every five children (some of only 11 years old) have secret social networks accounts that hide their parents and teachers according to a survey.
A survey conducted at 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of "False Insta" pages
This news caused an increase in the fear of published sexual content
Twenty percent of students claimed to have a "main" account to show their parents
One out of every five children (some of only 11 years old) are creating accounts on social networks that keep adults secret.
A survey conducted by 20,000 secondary students revealed an increase in the number of "False Insta" accounts (in reference to the social network for the exchange of Instagram photos).
This news caused an increase in the fear that sexual content is published.
Twenty percent of the students said they used a soft "main" account to show their parents while they had other private ones.
A mother who met with her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found a teenager who asked her to "viola."
The research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters" and Headmasters" Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of boys and girls between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC's head Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that there are so many teenagers trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the advice of the Scottish Federation of Athletics
Elid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Federation Council of Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most winning Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from their wide international experience over the past decade.
"Eilid enjoys a huge respect within the Scottish community, the UK and the world level, and we are sure that Scottish athleticism will benefit greatly from its incorporation to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm very keen to make athletes' spokespersons and I hope to be able to contribute and help direct sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Atlanta Games between a total of four Olympic gold and currently working as a usual commentator for the BBC, suffered a transitional ischemic attack that prevented him from walking.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago I suffered from an apoplexy.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine if I could get back and until I get back.
It was a exhausting job, but I was able to recover completely, I learned to walk again, and I'm currently doing austerity exercises.
"Thanks for the encouragement."
An announcement from a breast milk extractor compared to women with cows divided into public opinion on the networks
A parent milk extractor company divided public opinion into networks with an ad as compared to infants with cows that are moving.
To announce the launch of the declared "first extractor of silent mother milk portable world", Elvie published an ironic announcement in the style of a musical video to demonstrate the freedom that the new extractor offers to mothers.
Four royal mothers dance in a bowl full of rage for the cows at the rhythm of a song with letters like the following: "Yes, I move myself, but I don't have a tail" and "Because if you haven't noticed, they're not nudes, they're my breasts."
The chorus continues, "Mush, mush, I'm feeding babies, mush, mush, mush, I'm mushing my friends."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, provoked controversy on the networks.
With 77,000 reproductions and hundreds of comments, the video caused different reactions among the viewers. Many of them claimed that this poses the "horrores" of the dairy sector.
"Using cows to advertise this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to stay pregnant and give the light so they can produce milk, but in their case we stole their children days after giving the light," wrote one.

Another spectator commented: "Suddenly traumatic to the mother and the baby.
But yes, why aren't they used to announce a milk extractor for babies who stay with their babies?"
Another viewer added the following: "What ad with so little touch."
Other spectators defended the ad, even a woman said the song seemed "very funny."
"I feel like it's a great idea.
If I was still breasting, I'd buy one.
Taking out my milk made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little fired, but it's interpreted as a joke.
I think it's a great product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a fun announcement addressed to mothers who extract their milk (frequently in their places of work or in bathrooms) and feel like "vaces".
This is not an announcement to praise or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, this group of women revealed that they were dancing with the discreet extractors inserted into their subjects.
The concept on which the campaign is based is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the milk extractor Elvie is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and can be discreetly fit into a mother's subjection, which gives women freedom to move, submit their babies and even come out there while they're taking out their milk.
Ana Balarin, mother's executive creative partner and director, commented: "Elvie extractor is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a daring and provocative launch.
In describing the parallelism existing between women and milk cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of milk and all the challenges that entailed while we demonstrated in a manner of entertainment and close to the incredible feeling of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
It's not the first time that extractor Elvie takes over the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two creatures shot at the gateway to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children detained increased despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings remained relatively invariable, partly due to the strict rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump administration made it difficult to assign fathers to children.
Traditionally, most of the fathers were also immigrants without papers and were afraid to endanger their ability to stay in the country by taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that the potential employers and other adult members of their homes would have to send their fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the U.S. Customs and Immigration Service, testified to the Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had asked to recruit minors without company.
Subsequently, the agency confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80% of the people who are natives or who are part of their home are illegally found in the country, and a large part of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
That is why we will continue to pursue these individuals," said Mr Albence.
In order to process the children more quickly, the officials introduced new rules that would require any of them to appear in the trial before they spent a month in detention instead of 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to the refugee workers.
Many will appear through a video conference instead of a person to try to legalize their case against an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements for assistance will be quickly deported.
The longer they stay under custody, the more likely they will be to become anxious or depressed, which may cause violent seizures or attempts to flee according to the refugee workers and reports of the system published over the past few months.
The lawyers said that these fears increase in centers of larger dimensions such as Tornillo's, in which there are more possibilities that the symptoms that a child is going through are being misunderstood because of his size.
They also added that moving children to the camping area without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could be a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria requests the occupying forces of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouleem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is currently in its eighth year.
Mouleem, who also holds the position of Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were found in Syria alone illegally, with the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "be able to deal with them in a proper manner".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he communicated to the assembly.
Moulem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011 and millions of them had to flee their homes.
He also stated that Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "from all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has approximately 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish forces and the Arab Syrians who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in this country devastated by the war.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return were given and he blamed "some Western countries" for "dissemination of irrational fears" that caused refugees not to return.
"We appeal to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide assistance for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to put an end to the war.
UN diplomats claim that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral area in the last great rebel base of Idlib allowed for political talks to continue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, in which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that the military actions would have a destiny for the jihadists, including the soldiers on the Al-Nusra front linked to Al-Qaeda, who would "be eradicated".
The UN envoy of the Joint Staff is hoping to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draw up a draft post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions to ensure the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the body should be restricted to "review the articles of the current constitution" and warned against possible interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
Following that logic, Mr Trump would be able to re-elect in 2020 unless, as many liberals are waiting, impeachment and scandals put an end to his presidency in a premature manner.
Which would no doubt be "The most dramatic end of a presidency."
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among the observers.
Since 2014, the first-time audience rates have multiplied by more than two, to reach 1.05 million viewers in the CNN and almost tripled to reach 1.6 million in the MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime-time, an increase of 1.7 million over four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show's program led the cable channel audience indexes with 3.5 million viewers during the nights of important news.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because it's about something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, a drama showrunner for ABC "Designed Survivor", who is a secretary of the ministerial office who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys," the club has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver commented that he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? He asked you.
"He answered, 'Because it makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
There's entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else that appears on television, the plots that are arranged by Washington can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, if the immigrant families can reunite and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, it assumes something that goes beyond being an informed citizen spending six hours seeing a panel of experts discussing the use of "anonymous" sources by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear", the 1500-dollar avestre bomber of Paul Manafort's "a full of arrogance," said Washington Pos) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' scrupulous descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I won't look at Super Mario the same way.
"Part of what makes it seem like a reality show is that it's giving you something new every night," commented Brent Montgomery, high executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", a space that deals with the changes in characters and the daily argumental turns of Trump's show (the conflict with N.F.L., the compliments to Kim Jong-un...).
You can't afford to miss an episode or you'll stay behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he made the sun and a temperature of 26 degrees outside the house, on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked in the house watching the MSNBC while recording the CNN.
He wasn't able to get out while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy programs at the time and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss said.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

The external money comes to many to finance the nominations to the House for the election of half of the lexicure
It is not surprising that the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania is receiving a large flow of money due to the reorganization of a Congressional District with two representatives in positions in the career to occupy the same position.
This district located outside Pittsburgh which has recently been reorganized is represented by Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who won his place in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is represented against another representative in functions, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely superior to the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania was determined in January that the Republicans would manipulate the electoral circumscription of the former districts in their favor.
The election career in the new 17th Congressional District held a campaign funding festival between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Congress Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NCRC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after gaining a victory adjusted to the March special elections to the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, which enjoyed a wide-ranging follow-up.
That place was occupied by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States assessed the possibility of penalising O Salvador for its support of China and then dropped back
Diplomatics warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama would already recognize Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a pleasant meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and even held a hotel in Panama until his partners threw the Trump Organization steering team.
Officials of the Department of State decided to order returning to the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions of O Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "soon recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman in a statement made this same month.
However, only the possibility of applying sanctions against O Salvador, which received approximately US$ 140 million during 2017, including to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid, was discussed.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial assistance and restrictions on visas, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, US and Central American officials postponed the holding of a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent the emigration of people to the United States.
But in mid-September, important administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively putting an end to any possibility of applying sanctions to O Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is scheduled to conduct the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a symptom of the importance given to him by the administration, the diplomats said.
The three US envoys discreetly returned to O Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new message or harsh punishment from Washington.
A spokesman from Mr Bolton's White House declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal deliberations at all times and when the anonymity of the participants was maintained.
His accounts were corroborated by an external analyst near the administration and he also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity was preserved.
Study history
The next negative case could be the report of Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the case of possible obstruction to Mr Trump's justice, from which there are currently abundant evidence in the public file.
According to the report, Mr. Mueller is also conducting his investigation to find out if Mr. Trump's campaign has concurred with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump must report to that agency, just when you have to prepare for the elections, and you may finally have to face a popular jury.
They are very unknown and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall be inevitable, as well as that of his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officials were determined to give a coup d'état against Hitler if the western front resists and supports the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We fail and miss the opportunity to avoid the years of murders that happened later.
The course of history revolves around these points of inflection, and the inexorable progress of democracy is accelerated or backward.
The United States is facing several of these inflexibility points at this moment.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires the Deputy Attorney General of the State, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's research fate?
Rosenstein takes water to his neck since this paper reported that last year, he suggested to record secretly to the president and speculated that he was incapacitated for the office.
Mr. Rosenstein said The Times information is not true.
"How will we respond if the investigation that has just been requested by the F.B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not completed or is not impartial or if its appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed in spite of criminal charges of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-legislative elections for a Congress requiring responsibility for Mr Trump?
If we do not pass those tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my house, which I knew from the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, sent me to capture Shabat candles on that table that included a swastika.
With that legacy, how am I not going to be optimistic about the future?"

Rangers Graham Dorrans' player shows himself optimistic about the quick Vienna encounter
Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive empate achieved in Spain in front of the Villarreal this month, would put them in a very favourable position to be classified in the Group G of Europe League.
An injury in the knee prevented Central Campist Graham Dorrans from starting this season until the 2-2 empatt in front of the Villareal, but he thinks Rangers can use that result as a trampoline to get more important things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villareal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We went into the party believing that we could get something positive and we got a point.
We had the chance to win at the end, but in general, the empathy is probably a fair result.
They probably improved during the first half, but in the second we were superior.
Next Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope to reach the three points, but it will be difficult, because they have achieved a good result in their last party, but with the support of our audience, I am sure we will be able to fight to achieve a positive result.
Last year was hard between everything that happened to my injuries and the changes made on the team, but there's an excellent environment right now.
The team is good, the boys are having a good time and the training is good.
We hope to be able to fight, forget the past season and succeed."
Women care about their savings for their retirement
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey were clear as they wanted to be looked after, few people talked to their family about the matter.
About half of the participants in this study conducted by Nationwide claimed that they commented with their peers on the cost of prolonged care.
Only 10% said they'd talk to their children about it.
"People want a family to take care of her, but they are not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Life Insurance Department.
You can start next.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to take care of yourself if you don't communicate your wishes with a lot of anticipation.
Work with your advisor and your family to wake up where and how to receive care, as these decisions can be a determining factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor may also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Among the funding options for extended care are a traditional extended care insurance policy, a cash-life hybrid insurance policy to help cover these expenses or the self-security covered with your own funds, whenever you have money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to appoint a trusted person to monitor your medical care and make sure that professionals meet your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
It also values the possibility of signing a notarial power to manage your finances.
You'll have to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you're incapacitated.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your parent has a medical emergency and goes on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Please note that this information is detailed in a written plan to be prepared.
"Not only is the financial issue at stake, but who are the doctors who care for it?" asked Martin.
"What medicines are you taking?
Who'll take care of the dog?
Set up a plan."
A man gets several shots with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man received multiple shots with a compressed air rifle as he walked back home after going out at night.
The victim, aged 40, was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, in Devon, when he received gunshots in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which occurred approximately at 02:30 (British summer time) as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
Your wounds are not serious, and the police are looking for possible witnesses.
Teremotes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, caused the death of at least 384 people, a figure that is expected to continue to increase.
Because of the communication cuts, the rescue bodies were unable to obtain any information from the Dongala region, a zone located north of Palu which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake of 7.5 degrees magnitude.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
We then provided you with some key data on Palu and Dongala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Célebes Central province, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Célebes, with a population of approximately 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunamis occurred.
Dongala is a regency located over 300 km from the coast to the northwest of the island of Célebes.
This regency, a region less than one province, had an estimated population of 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the Central Célebes province, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Dongala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also affected the western part of Dongala in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia finds itself on the Pacific fire belt of high seismic activity, so it suffers earthquakes regularly.
These are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis that have suffered in recent years:
2004: An important earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh in Indonesia, north of Sumatra, which occurred on 26 December, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean, more than half in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes affected the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, in front of the Sumatran coast.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 degrees magnitude struck south of Xava, the most populated island of Indonesia, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, causing the death of almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 degrees of magnitude was caused near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake affected the Mentawai islands, located in front of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of people and caused the death of about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the Pidie Jaya Regency, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the destruction caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunamis of 2004.
There were no tsunamis on this occasion, but more than 100 people died because of the fall of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, which caused the death of more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily shot.
Arresting the eldest son of Sarah Palin for allegations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, a 29-year-old naturalist from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested suspected of a domestic violence offence, preventing the submission of a complaint by domestic violence and resistance to authority, according to a note published by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he removed his phone.
Palin remains in pre-trial detention in Mat-Su Pretral Facility units with a loan of $500, according to KTUU.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, in which he declared "no guilt, since then" when he was asked, he informed the chain.
Palin is charged with three minor A crimes, which means he could be in prison for up to a year and receive a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a minor B crime, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges are brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently found in the Alaska War veterans Tribunal.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic aggression, of preventing the submission of a complaint for domestic violence and of possession of Hebrew weapons in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of poking a fist in his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome that he suffers after serving with the army in Iraq.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia cause hundreds of deaths
Counted at least 384 dead after the earthquake that affected the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5 degree magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and the balance of the dead is expected to increase in the course of the day.
The earthquake was just ahead of Central Celebes, in the northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jacarta.
They circle videos through social networks where the moment of impact is shown.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek to apply a few times the death penalty to the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutors in New York are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York terrorist attack that caused the death of eight people, a penalty not applicable in the state since 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a biking attack on the West Side Highway Avenue in Lower Manhattan, tracking the lives of the pedestrians and cyclists he found on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to demonstrate that Saipov "intendedly" killed the eight victims and caused them serious "intendedly" injuries, according to the notification of the intention to apply for the death penalty presented in the South District of New York.
Both offences involve the possibility of applying the death penalty according to the judge's document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury presented Saipov with a charge of 22 crimes, including eight murder crimes in collaboration with an organized crime group, usually used by the prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a crime of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required a "notable planning and premeditation," the prosecutors declared by describing the way Saipov carried out the "atrocious, cruel and devious" attack.
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" as indicated in the notice of intent.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade ago, the South District of New York did not prosecute a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but finally the permanent chain was sentenced in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was performed after being sentenced by conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse during the days and months after the attack according to the court documents.
He told the investigators he felt good about what he did, as the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that in order to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the videos of the ISIS that he showed on his phone according to the charge.
He also asked to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, said the police.
It was declared not guilty of 22 crimes.
David Patton, one of the federal lawyers responsible for representing Saipov, indicated that they were "evidently disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a declaration of guilt with a permanent chain without a possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all involved people," Patton commented.
Saipov's defense team would ask the prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
A parliamentary tory claims that NIGEL FARAGE should be put in front of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize an army of people" today during a protest at the tory conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party stated that politicians had to " feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested that they should handle negotiations with the EU.
Regular Mr Peter Bone said before Birmingham's demonstration that the United Kingdom would "have already left" the EU if Mr Farage was the secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge that Mrs May faces in reconciling the divided lines of her party was evidenced by joining the Tories that are favorable to remain in the EU for an independent protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to maintain the commitments of his Chequers plan between the attacks of the Brexit, the opponents and the EU.
His allies insisted that he continue to fight to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and laborers to choose between their plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone said in the concentration of the Leave Means Leave of Solihull movement that he wanted to end the Chequers plan.
I suggested that Mr Farage should have been contacted to assume responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If it had been entrusted to you, we would already be outside the EU at this time," he said.
The member of the Wellingborough Parliament added: 'I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must abolish the Chequers plan'.
Showing its opposition to the EU, he said: "We do not fight world wars to serve.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone denied the suggestions indicating that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and wants to stay in the EU is completely false".
The member of the towers and party of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also came to the march, since he showed the reporters: "The only thing I say is: prime minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan has no popularity among public opinion, the opposition will not vote in favour of it, it is unpopular between our party and our activists who, to begin with, are those who occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel Chequers' plan and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said in the concentration that it is necessary to make politicians feel uncomfortable if they intend to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Today this is a topic of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit's decision and here we're meeting today to tell them we won't let them out with theirs."
In a message addressed to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit's decision, feel uncomfortable.
"We are mobilizing the army of people in this country who gave us the victory in Brexit and will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the EU's remaining partners took a march through Birmingham before celebrating a concentration of two hours in the city centre.
A few activists ran away with the Tories Against Brexit (Tories Against Brexit) message after the group's release this weekend.
Laborator Lord Adonis has mocked the conservatives for the security problems they suffered in a party application at the beginning of the conference.
"This is the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a free frontier, to enjoy free market without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It is an absolute farce.
Brexit's concept doesn't exist," he added.
Warren plans to think seriously or present himself to the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would think seriously of his candidacy after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday during a municipal session in a village in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will present the reelection in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It focuses on speculations that place it as Trump's successor in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon at Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his electors using the format of the council since Trump assumed the presidency.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to introduce himself to the president.
Warren replied that it is time that "we women go to Washington to solve the problems of our government, and that is why a woman in the presidency is missing."
A kill shot by Sims, LSU player, was performed
Baton Rouge police, The Angels, announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested by the murder of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge's police department announced the 20-year-old arrest of Dyteon Simpson in a press conference held at 11:00 (east time).
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help to identify a man who came out in the images.

Great prize from Russia: Lewis Hamilton comes to the world thanks to the team orders, which enabled him to win over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the time that Valtteri Bottas was ranked in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team orders would be decisive in the career.
Bottas, who was leaving the pole, had a good exit and almost left Hamilton only while defending his position during the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into boxes first and let Hamilton run traffic in the back of the group, something that would prove decisive.
Mercedes stopped in boxes one time later and went out behind Vettel, but Hamilton pushed him after several wheeled maneuvers that caused Ferrari's driver to leave the interior unattended the risk of being delayed after a double defensive maneuver on the third curve.
Max Verstappen left from the last row of the exit grid and rose to the seventh square at the end of the first round on the day of his 21st anniversary.
Then he led the race during a large part of this thanks to which he kept his tires to get to the end of the race faster and to advance Kimi Raikkonen by the fourth position.
Finally he entered boxing around 44 but could not hold any position in the last eight rounds, which ended with Raikkonen in the fourth square.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri did an excellent job all weekend and he was a real gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two squares," Hamilton said.
A poorly qualified body language
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Feinstein in an act celebrated on Saturday by his insistence that he did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, was charged with sexual abuse.
In a speech in an act in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of the witness given by Ford in front of the Senate Judicial Committee and commented in his place that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "miserable, repugnant and false".
"The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful that is happening in the last days in the Senate, when you see indignation, when you see that people who are angry and who are miserable, repugnant and lying," he said.
"When you see these publications and filterings and they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I wasn't."
Are you kidding me?
Diane Feinstein, did you do any filtration?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document? "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I wasn't.
Wait a minute.
Did we filter it?...No.", he added imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent him the letter detailing the accusations against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and filtered in early September, but Feinstein denied that the filtration came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't filter his story," Feinstein said to the committee, as reported in The Hill.
"I asked you to keep your privacy and do what you asked me to do."
But his denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who commented on the following during the act of Saturday night: "I told you that the body language was not the right one.
He may not be filtered, but he used the worst body language I've ever seen in my life."
Continuing with his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of improper sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
‘They are determined to recover power by any means necessary.
They are evil and repugnant, they don't care who's hurt, they have to lie down to recover power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the defeat on Friday at Elite League against Belfast Giants winning the game back for 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants gained an early advantage through two goals Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got into the local set before Dwyer re-established the Giants' advantage.
Francois Bouchard got into Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to win.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League of the season for the men of Adam Keefe, who managed to get back to winning Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with a balance of the three victories before the Giants.
Dwyer's initial goal was produced at 3:35 p.m. through Kendall McFaul's assistance, and the second came four minutes later by Beauvillier after David Rutherford's assistance.
In an early period of agitation, Sullivan put the local team back in the match at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to mark the goal of the match at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants moved in the marker before the first break when he scored his second goal at night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard regrouped the game with a goal through power play in a minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined each other to help Nielsen join the Dundee for the first time in the match at the end of the second period and secured the victory through the fifth goal of his team in the mid-last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play home in Milton Keynes their next game, which will be held on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers from an aircraft can escape a earthquake
An Indonesian air controller considered a hero after he died to ensure that an aircraft loaded with hundreds of passengers could safely be fired.
The balance of dead people is 800 and there are many disappeared after a great earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to feel in the area and are many people trapped under the castles of the city of Palu.
Although his workmates fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport, Palu, which was violently weighed down.
He remained in his seat to make sure that Batik Air's 6321 flight, which was on the exit track at that time, could safely be fired.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was going to crash.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesperson Yohannes Sirat said it is possible that this decision would allow hundreds of lives to be saved, reported Australia's ABC News channel.
We've prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Let's break our heart when we're buried," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the death balance may be thousands and the country's disaster management agency has stated that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The victim's balance is believed to continue to increase because there are many bodies under the helmets and many of them could not be reached," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman, said.
Waves up to six meters destroyed Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting help and life.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Drinkable water is scarce.
People are getting the minimums."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told the CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is fighting to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could become much worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" told CNN.
Indonesia suffered earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aviation accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that there is a missing one after a plane accident in a lake
The aircraft that operates a flight that exploded in a Pacific lake in Micronesia now claims that there is a missing person after previously claiming that the 47 passengers and crew would leave without incident the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a communiqué that since Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline reported that it was working together with the authorities, hospitals and local researchers to try to locate this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the most detailed requests for information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Ships in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crash against the water while trying to land at Chuuk's airport.
The authorities stated Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The aircraft reported that six passengers continued in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events continues to be unclear.
Both the aircraft and the United States Army confirmed that the plane landed in the pond before reaching the landing track.
Some witnesses claim that the plane passed the landing track long.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger of American nationality, commented that he came in very little time.
"That's something extremely positive," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that both he and other passengers managed to advance between the water that reached their waist to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He also remembered that the flight attendants were shouting and frightened, and that he suffered a slight wound in his head.
The U.S. Army reported that some sailors who were working close to the site in the pilot's improvement tasks also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to move people to the coast before the plane sinks about 30 meters.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people died in aircraft accidents registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none affected Air Niguini.
An analyst consists of the time of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution was sent to the trial on Saturday in the repetition of a man charged with burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst at the United States Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described to the jury how he used the records of a mobile phone to recompose the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the victim of 19, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received data from the location of several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was meeting with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting his previous claims as reported by The Clarion Ledger.
When these data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went down the road on Saturday and testified that that day was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "a liar, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks since he died.
Mobile phone records indicated that they only met for a week.
Rowlett stated that once after Chambers died, Tellis removed the messages, calls and contact information from Chambers' phone.
"Stolen of his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge showed that he was expecting the judge to be judged by the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A third of hip hop wants to challenge the negative perception that the genre has by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a Bristol group, claims that the hip hop has withdrawn from its origins with political messages and combating social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and get the fighting hip hop back to be popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common recently experienced a resurgence in the United Kingdom through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?
A New York Children's Guardian asks a couple after a "racist" message.
A New Yorker child guardian will demand a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message that would not be addressed to her from her mother in which she complained that she was "another black."
The couple refuse to be racist and compare the demand with an "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed her anguish by discovering that the guardian of the children Giselle Maurice was black when she presented her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON, OTHER NEGRA," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing his mistake, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the caregiver who had just gone, who was African American, had done his job badly and waited for a Filipino according to the New York Post announcement.
Mrs. Maurice paid her day of work and sent her home to a Uber.
Now Maurice is going to ask the couple to get compensation for the dismissal and requires a compensation of $350 per day for the six months of internal work for those who were initially hired even though there was no contract on average.
"Look, I want to show you that these things don't happen," he told Post on Friday, to add "It's a case of discrimination."
The couple replied to the charges of racism, claiming to fire Maurice was the most reasonable, since they were afraid they could not trust her after she was offended.
"My wife would send you a message that I had no intention of sending you.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco's husband to Post.
"But would they leave their children in the hands of a person to whom they have offended, even though it was because of a mistake?
Your baby just born?
Come on!"
After comparing the demand with an "extortion," Plasco stated that his wife had just had a baby two months ago and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are they going for a person like that?
That's not very ethical," the investment banker added.
While the legal process continues, the public opinion court quickly denounced the couple on social networks, attacking them for their behavior and the logic applied.
Paddington editors feared that readers would not be identified with a speaking bear as they could end up in a new card
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented the following about the letter: "It's hard to put on the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It's very fun to know now what we know about the huge success of Paddington."
After saying that his father, who worked as a camera for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book on a small toy bear, would be optimistic about the possibility that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "suffering" after his death last year.
From Paddington, to whom he describes as a "very important member of our family," he added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he finally achieved.
"He was a quiet man and nothing imagined," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who gets something: you're proud even though you didn't really do it.
I think he felt the success of Paddington a little that way.
Although it was a creation of his and a product of his imagination, he always gave all the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and had to fire me over the phone
After the landing, his daughter was rushed to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked unsuccessfully to save his life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was very bad, that he was not expected to survive.
"Then I received Nad's call to tell me that I was going to die in the next two minutes and had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications doctors gave him so that his heart would continue to slow down were slowly consuming and leaving his body.
I've died a while ago and now I'm turning off.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing it was happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation around families and people.
I had to stand up to it."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, at that moment of struggle for the loss of her daughter, entered the plane with the other passengers, without noting the calvary that was suffering.
"No one's detected it," he said.
"I had my head down and I had tears all the time.
It turns out hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this impressive feeling of solidarity for Nad.
That I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her."
Posts of afflicted women to avoid suicides on a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are taking cards to a galley bridge with inspiration messages and phone numbers to whom you can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and he committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want no father to feel like I have to feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile was in any room."
However, he left the job before he died and was "a very deep depression."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that a side effect is taking place."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people who can come and talk to, even if he's a friend.
You don't stay silent, you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, has lost Mark, her mate for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't comment on me being sad or depressed or anything like that," he commented.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we detected a change in his attitude.
Christmas day touched the bottom (when the children opened their agasalls, he made no visual contact with them or anything)."
He claimed that his death was a huge trauma to them, but they must overcome it: "He broke up the family.
They set us up.
But we have to keep moving forward and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is a thread while the FBI is starting research.
"I thought that if we could get something like what I was asking (a research for a limited time and limited range), we might get a little bit of unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be "blowing" due to the paralysing of the parties.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Its repetitiveness is due to a matter of time.
Five weeks are missing for half-legislative elections (November 6th). If, as expected, Republicans get bad results, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the man they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush was calling senators, exerting pressure to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to which, he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI carries out its report?
A vote will be taken in the Senate, which currently occupy 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice-president, to break the bill and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
Number of deserters in North Korea low under Kim's mandate
The number of North Korea deserters destined for South Korea has been reduced from Kim Jong One's access to power seven years ago, according to a South Korea legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean unification ministry, said that 1,127 deserts occurred during the last year, far from 2,706 of 2011.
Mr Park said that the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs charged by people on the other side of the border were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comments.
The vast majority of North deserters finally offer South Korea citizenship.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 Norwegians illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them have gone through China, which has the largest border crossing with North Korea, and it's easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized area that exists between the two Koreans.
China considers the deserters to be illegal migrants instead of refugees and often repatriates them compulsorily.
The relationship between the north and the south (which technically continues in war) has improved significantly over the past few months.
This same month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on the negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This occurred after the historic meeting in June between the president of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-one, held in Singapore, where they agreed to work a great way to eliminate nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States for the lack of progress ever since.
"If we do not have confidence in the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security and, in these circumstances, there is no possibility that we will disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Mr. Ri in a speech delivered in front of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and says it's not appropriate to access the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and assured that he was not fit by his nature to access the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview held on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival of Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever acted that way, she would call her hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's statement in front of the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the charges of sexual abuse on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, at times almost shouting and staying talking while describing his family and his years of high school.
He also explicitly condemned the democrats of the committee, catalysing the accusations against him as "a murder of the grotesque and coordinated reputation" organized by liberals angry with the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi stated that he believed that Kavanaugh's statement showed that he could not access the Supreme Court because he demonstrated that he had prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think you're dequalifying yourself with those statements and the way you attacked Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi objected when he was asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh if he was confirmed in the post and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
"What I have to say is this: if you're not telling Congress or the FBI the truth, then it's not appropriate to be in the Supreme Court alone, but in the court where you are currently," Pelosi commented.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Appeals Circuit Court.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she was concerned about the possible resolutions that Kavanaugh could adopt against the law of protection to the patient and the care of accessible health or the Roe case against Wade, since it is considered a conservative judge.
In view of the confirmation, Kavanaugh has raised questions as to whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be nullified.
"It's not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to enter the court and still wait for us to say, look what's right," said Pelosi.
And women need to do it.
It's a justified diathropist, months and years of rage going on, and it can't be kicked out without crying.
"We'll see when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's that weird, do I?"
He continued, "I received a lot of help from a woman who was executive somewhere, who said she was also crying when she was angry, but who developed a technique that consisted of that, when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, "You're probably thinking I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then, I kept going.
I think it's brilliant."
The tears are allowed as an escape valve for the anger in part because they are essentially not understood.
One of my nicest memories in one of my first jobs in an office dominated by men, in which I began to cry with an impossible anger to describe, was that a larger woman grabbed me from the back of my neck, a taller one that would always provoke me to fear, and led me to the bottom of the stairs.
"You never let them see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll comfort you if they come to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an adventure outside of marriage in a boat called Monkey Business and was withdrawn from the presidential career, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought that there was no reason why she could not consider presenting herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a well-thought decision," I said among the laughs 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another.
Someone named it Brancaneves and the seven pines.
Because the campaign was advanced, it was delayed in fundraising, so he swore he wouldn't go into the run for the presidency unless he could get $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of those who supported her contributed $1,000 to the male candidates, only $250.
"What do you think, that I have a discount?" he asked.
When he made his speech to announce that he would not present a formal campaign, he was overcome by emotions (by gratitude to the people who supported it, by frustration with the system that made it difficult to collect money and to address voters instead of the delegates and by angry with the existing sexism) who remained speechless.
"You'd think I'd had a nervous crisis," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how she reacted to the press with her.
"You'd think Kleinex was my sponsorship.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my stone?
"Woman?"
How can trade war between the United States and China be positive for Beijing
The initial bombings of the trade war between the United States and China have been overwhelming, and although the war is far from over, a distance between the countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, launched the first warning at the beginning of this year by recording Chinese key exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant scale this week was the application of new tariffs that affect an equivalent of $200,000 million, recording half of the articles coming to the United States from China.
Pequin hired each other in the same way, the most recent rate rising from five to ten percent in $60,000 million in American products.
China has promised to imitate US measures and it seems unlikely that the world's second largest economy will change in the short term.
To get Washington to step back, it would be necessary to surrender to his demands, but publicly bending to the United States would be much more embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing knows how to play its cards correctly, the pressures of trade war with the United States could favour China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the necessary conditions to start an economic crisis in the two countries is actually much more dangerous than previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a research center in Asia's Center for New American Security, a study center.
Syria is "list" for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria claims it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is requesting help to rebuild the country devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem said the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now all the necessary conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to be abandoned due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their livelihoods are in place.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people continue to live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would appreciate the help it can receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance from countries that supported the lifting.
Europe achieves victory at Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 defeating the US team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National club located outside Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive U.S. defeat in European territory and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who offered the most battle during the tournament, sent the ball to the water in the hole 16 of par 3, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer shined in all his series, becoming one of the only four players who achieved a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was installed in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated by the player with the worst ranking of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, in Denmark.
The first world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2+1 against Englishman Ian Poulter, which is possible to play his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight rival Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the European player with more tournament victories, with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry often, but today I can't help it.
It was a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to be able to get the drink back.
The important thing is the team, and I am happy to be able to help," said a excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passed the witness to his compatriot John Ram, who was able to defeat the U.S. flag of Tiger Woods by 2&1 on Sunday's individual match.
"It's amazing how proud I am today to be able to defeat Tiger Woods. I grew up playing that boy," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 at Ryder Cup.
It's a strange statistics for one of the best players of all time, a 14-larger winner, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble getting out of the streets all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-calibre golf course throughout the tournament.
The U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the frustrating performance of his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, Europeans were in difficulty.
We fight.
I take the hat off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
Your 12 players played very well.
We'll reorganize, work with the PGA of America and with our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll go ahead.
I want these 12 boys and I'm proud to be captain.
It's for taking out the hat.
They were superior."
