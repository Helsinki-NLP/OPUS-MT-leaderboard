Chief UN declares there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon states that his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict that lasts for almost five years and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again asked all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unify and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said Wednesday at a conference that he intends to meet with foreign ministers from five permanent countries present in the Council - the US, Russia, China, England and France - on the side of the ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban regretted that the divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and the regional forces "have made this unresolved situation".
The Ban asked the five permanent members to give evidence of solidarity and unity shown when they were able to conclude an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 survey figures showing Donald Trump has real chances
Some have tried to label him as a flip-flop politician.
Others called him a joke.
And others are waiting for the implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to throw Donald Trump from the top of the polls, it didn't work (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys showed that Donald Trump is leading with one percent of the two figures, and some voices are starting to wonder what this means for the chances of naming the real estate.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says Trump will win the race for nominating the Republicans.
Pointits shows that, in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance made Herman Cain a place in the polls, but none of them won in any state during the nomination.
And the reasons why it would be hard to fight the general election are numerous.
But external groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative club for Growth admit Trump's power and start supporting him with money.
We also present a few figures from recent surveys suggesting that the real estate is not just something passing:
The figures that indicate support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees.
Even before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two of the 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate movement.
By mid-July, the percentage had risen to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Today, six out of 10 Republicans have a favourable opinion about Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 people say they have a negative opinion.
These figures are maintained.
A survey conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of the Republicans in the region have a favourable opinion about Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the nomination race.
In a survey conducted last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of the Republicans said they would be "enthusiast" or "thank you" if Trump won the nomination race.
Only two out of 10 say it would be "survey" if Trump won the nomination race.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% declare it would be "enthusiasmed" to 40% who declares the same thing about Trump).
The closest to enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters claim that they would be "unthankful" or "suppressed" if the favorite Jeb Bush wins the nomination race.
Most Republicans don't consider Trump's temperament a problem.
Although Donald Trump was strongly criticised for the insults and his bombastic style, 52% of the Republican voters at the national level consider that the real estate movement has the right temperature to be president, according to the survey conducted by ABC News/Washington Post months.
We see the same figures in Iowa, where 52% of the Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to be a leader, according to the survey carried out last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% are of the opinion that he does not have the necessary personality to act efficiently and nearly six out of 10 independent people claim that his temperature does not have what he is looking for at the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are used to the idea.
When I take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a survey conducted last week by CNN/ORC, on the question who has the most chance to win the race for GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation has changed before the end of July, when four out of 10 would have been on Jeb Bush.
Full information: in the past, GOP voters did not read very well the future.
In the same period of the last election, four of the 10 Republicans elected Rick Perry in the nomination process, up to only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that the majority of GOP electors consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Even if Republicans or rebounded to another candidate, Trump is still in the front of everyone.
Some voices say the divided situation will probably contribute to Trump's victory, while Trump's support will be divided into more than twelve candidates.
However, a survey conducted at the beginning of September of the University of Monmouth shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a cooperation between Trump and the majority of other Republicans candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is located at a distance of 13 points from Carly Fiorina, 14 points from Marco Rubio, 15 points from Walker, 19 points from Jeb Bush and finally 33 points from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's almost equal to Ted Cruz.
The only candidate that beats him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman with 19 points in a hypothetical confrontation between one and the other.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they've decided.
A new survey conducted on Tuesday by CBS/NYT shows that over half of the voters who support Trump declare that they do not change their voting option.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this sense and no one can say that they will never change their mind.
46% say it leaves the door open to change its option.
However, Trump's most important opponent is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but it is twice as likely as voters who declare they have decided to vote with Trump.
Six of the 10 Republicans claim they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violators" at the opening of his campaign, two months ago, immigration was the main topic in the campaign for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic style will lead to a split between important Spanish voters and the Republican Party and will undermine rebranding efforts.
However, according to the ABC/Post survey conducted months, six out of 10 Republicans claim to agree with Trump on immigration.
So, it seems as long as the immigration problem remains in the light of the reflectors, so will the Doland Trump.
Frustration against authorities reaches new peaks.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by nearly half of the Republican voters, largely because of their foreign status.
According to the ABC/Post survey conducted Monday, six of the 10 Republicans claim that they prefer a political outsider to someone with experience in government.
People are also angry with the Washington authorities.
A survey conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the performance of the Republics in Congress, 54% being "unthanked" and 21% being "enraged".
Jeremy Corbyn starts at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQs has long been expected
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will later begin at Prime Minister's Questions, facing David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbyn will address the first of the six questions he has the right to shortly after lunch; his performance will probably be analyzed almost by the media and the Labour MPs.
As part of the weekly appearances, he asked for “less theatre and more facts”.
He also stated that he could give up some participations and give them to his colleagues.
The conference will be Mr. Corbyn's first parliamentary test as leader, coming after he called a "phantom cabinet" and after the speech he held at the annual TUC conference on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the decision of the leader of the Labour Party to keep silence on the birth of the national immunisation in a job held on Tuesday at the anniversary of the 75th anniversary of England's Battle attracted critics from conservative parliamentarians and kept the first page of the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn said that he "kept silence in a respectful manner" and acknowledged "the heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of England."
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's ghost cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight show that he would be recommended to the Labour leader to sing "independently" his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers in the ghost cabinet refused to be part of Mr. Corbyn's front team, arguing by differences of opinion related to the economy, defence and external, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant states that political differences are "collecting" in the Labourist Party following Mr. Corbyn's appointment regarding his position towards the European Union and limited benefits.
Mr. Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party will bring about changes that will eliminate the idea of limitation completely.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, Minister of Labour and Pensions, said the party "is very clear" in the exclusive opposition to government plans to reduce the "head" level from 26,000 lire to 23,000 lire.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth labyrinth leader facing David Cameron at the court in the last decade, since he took over the Conservative Party's leadership.
The laborist leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "outsourced" for questions to be addressed to Mr Cameron and has received over 30,000 suggestions.
Parliament's Islington North said that PMQs involves too high a level of confrontation and that it will refrain from replicating and attacking, committed to focusing on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges faced by young people.
Mr. Corbyn said Angela Eagle, the finance minister, will hold a seat at PMQs when he cannot participate - for example when Mr. Cameron moves abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the floor on occasion, saying he had approached the President of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this matter.
In 2005, when he took the lead, Mr Cameron said he wanted to give up the political style "Punch and Judy" often associated with PMQs, but he acknowledged a few years later that he did not succeed in his course.
Since the first transmission in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of a leader's rationale, the way in which it leads the House of Representatives and its position among parliamentary colleagues, although the critics claim to have become a cartoon and need a thorough reform.
" Framework in Joburg": Youth without shelter benefits from photography courses
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way to learn a job and win their life.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young people without shelter to take pictures of the areas in which they live and earn money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
Chief JD Sports says higher wages could damage extensions
President JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, states that an increase in the minimum wage in the UK could mean "a greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
However, it is unlikely that that purchasing power will exceed the higher costs for the labour force within the firm, he says.
Costs could have an impact on JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean less new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a side victim in the "furtuna" created around his friend, Nick Kyrgyos, and his behavior deserves better words of praise and does not criticize, in the opinion of President Dennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often called "Special Ks", was unsatisfyingly drawn in the light of the reflections by the scandalous side that Kyrgios had against Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters Tournament.
In a match of qualifications played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the chair arbitrator had to intervene twice to divide Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after Harrison said: "Wawrinka should have put him on the ground on Kyrgyos, and I should have put him on the ground on this boy."
Although he was last seen doing a dust rocket after he had muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tournament, angry Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is now in Glasgow, where he fights Sam Groth for the place two to the individual, after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against England.
"One thing I feel strong about is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was drawn a little into conflict," Healy said.
The truth is that he broke a rocket when he lost because he accused the crash in the US, but he's not the first player to break a rocket from frustration to himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he wouldn't be proud of it.
But to be serious, he was very well mastered in quite challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of trust.
He's got an extraordinary team, he's got a great family next door, and I think he was treated unfairly.
He is a 19-year-old very mature, he works hard and has joined the team, has had no conflict with other players, is highly respected in dress, is trained hard, is in an excellent form, is a very balanced and mature young and I think he deserves to be judged solely on the basis of his qualities and defects.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgyos into account for the important rebate match, which begins Friday, and described the "common decision" as the most appropriate for all, but supported the return of the player from Canberra in the long term in the team.
"First of all, we want the team to focus on the game completely and not think about the controversy around him [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick came up very quickly, as people like Feder and Murray said, he matured under the public's eyes and made some terrible mistakes and deserved to be criticized, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and I think he needs a time when he's not at the center of attention to be able to reflect, good thing for both the team and for him.
2016 Elections: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernie Sanders has fallen by half in national polls
The former State Secretary, Hillary Clinton, still has a two-digit advantage in the democratic race for national candidacy, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins the ground.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of the democratic electors (down from 58%), while Sanders is on the second floor, with 27% (up to 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not announced if he is to run for the presidency, is supported by 15% of the democratic electorate.
At least five months before the start of the primary elections, most democratic voters say it is too early to say they have decided on the candidate they will support.
However, Clinton supporters are more firm in their choice than other candidates.
In front of the CBS survey last month, Clinton lost land in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percent.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has decreased.
Support among men has decreased considerably and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton's advantage among the democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, now being equal to Sanders.
However, Clinton is still in favour of senior voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders, with one percent of two figures, among the liberals, but Sanders now has an easy advantage of 5 points in this group.
About half of the democratic voters at the national level declare that they would be enthusiastic about Clinton if they were chosen to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it only because it represents the party.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are excited about its choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who don't currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support her with enthusiasm.
While 48% of the democratic electors declare that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican electors who declare the same thing about the first class is lower, Donald Trump (35%).
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why she would want to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this function (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these aspects and eligibility shall also be mentioned.
Given that the vice-presidents are considering a possible candidate for the presidency, 57% of the democratic electors would like to see it underway - although a third I do not think it should run.
On the question of the second option for the party representative, democratic voters call Biden a majority.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half said that Biden would be the second option, much before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Sanders is increasing, from 20 points to 30 points if he does not run.
55% of the democratic voters consider Clinton the candidate with the highest chance of winning general elections; however, the figures have dropped from 78% last month.
Biden is located at a distance of two but the percentage according to which the most eligible has grown.
However, when asked what is most important in an elected candidate, democratic voters prefer problems instead of eligibility.
Like last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as the party's representative in the presidential run.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are well dealt with with a few key features of their party's primary electors.
The majority of the electors consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be integrity and trust and strong leadership.
Biden is seen best among all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of the democratic voters do not believe that H. Clinton is integrated and trusted, twice as much as those who declare this about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not have an opinion on him in this regard.
The democratic electors also generally consider that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
Referring to all these aspects, about a quarter of democratic voters do not have an opinion on Sanders.
As there are still questions about the use of a personal email address and a server by Hillary Clinton when he was the Secretary of State, most democratic voters are grateful for his explanation on the subject and say that he did not affect their general opinion on the candidate.
But things are different for the American public.
Half of the Americans are not happy with her explanation now, while only about a third are happy.
The public opinion was divided into March on this subject, shortly after the issue came to light.
The majority of Americans declare that that email-related dispute did not affect their general opinion on Clinton, although 36% say they have changed their opinion negatively.
Most Republicans, more than six out of 10, say they have changed their opinion about Clinton in a negative way.
Although democratic voters consider Clinton to be integral and trusted, this aspect continues to raise problems among voters at the general level: only 32% consider it to be integral and trusted, 8% less than last month and 15% less than in the past.
62% of voters do not consider it to be complete and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of voters at the national level do not consider Trump to be fully and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Among the six assessed candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush are first classified in terms of integrity.
The number of people who regard Sanders as integral is greater than those who are not of the same opinion, however, as in Carson's case, many do not have an opinion about him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the charged Brotherhood for the murder of a student in 1 year at the Baruch Faculty
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during a ceremony in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people were accused of murder.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood of the Baruch Faculty in New York brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during a ritual of initiation in September 2013 and delayed to take him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say that the victim was eye-bound, placed behind him a 14 kg bag full of sand and was repeatedly crushed while trying to get to a goal, on a frozen ground.
Mr. Deng charged with headaches after losing his knowledge.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brother didn't call the emergency number after he left and pretend he'd been waiting an hour before taking him to the hospital, the police say.
But they found the time to change Deng's clothes, look for his symptoms on Google and contact Andy Meng, the president of the brotherhood at the national level, to ask him for advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide personal property and put in practice the good of the brotherhood before Michael Deng's good," Wagner said.
He couldn't be resurrected and died the second day of the morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated trauma to the head, trunks and thighs.
"Many families have been devastated by the friar rituals, since 1970 at least one student lost his life every year because of the rituals," said Douglas Fierberg, Deng's lawyer, in a statement.
Their brothers and their members must be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The Grand Jury of Monroe District recommended that the first five members be charged with a three-degree murder.
Other thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, will also be charged with ultrasound and complicity to crime.
"We want to draw not only the people involved but, if there is an organization that has authorized the brotherhood, officially or informally, we will also draw it to the answer," Wagner said at a press conference Tuesday.
Baruch's faculty banned the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood withdrew its membership with local representation.
This is what will happen when the Federal Reserve will increase the interest rate
The interest rate will rise and the bull market (the growing market) will fall, the profitability of the bonds will increase and the economy will fall.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it's gonna take and how long.
In the economy, history offers little indication of the time frame..
After the first growth of the interest rate, the recession occurred in only 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates is often, although not always, a determinant factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
Therefore, US central bank officials have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on the time when interest rates are beginning to increase but on the time-track needed to normalise.
Actually, there are multiple variables in the game.
In the end, however, market players could find that all the excitement associated with the increase in interest rates has been exaggerated.
"The first increase in the interest rate decided by the Fed after the global financial crisis will be unavoidably interpreted by some voices as a sign of the era of "left bananas," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note addressed to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal levels, but it is still small to be the seismic shock that everyone seems to fear.
But it can't be said that there will be no effects.
We continue to present how a few sectors of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
Given the market situation in the last few months, the anticipated increase in interest rates can fly for a while.
But at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for the profitability of capital to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first growth, which may reflect the failure of monetary policy again," analysts Deutsche Bank said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed growth.
More precisely, over the past 35 years, the market has grown rapidly - with about 14 percent - towards increasing the interest rate, quite invariable in the 250-day period after (average decline of 2.6%) after it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by the Head of Nuveen Asset Management strategy.
Deutsche said that the impact on the shares tends to become pronounced later in the growth of the interest rate cycle and the benefits are beginning to drop.
The recession is a reality of economic life, but increasing the interest rate often contributes to it.
In the face of the situation, the Fed faces conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
More precisely, the gross domestic product will approach its historical minimum point for an increase in the Fed interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 growth in interest rates since 1950, nominal GDP was only twice as low as 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, little is expected to persist, the third quarter only reaching 1.5%, according to Atlanta Fed.
The increase in interest rates in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question "if this is different," Deutsche said.
Market players have been preparing themselves all year round for a growing decision on the part of the Fed, all eyes being focused on this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission, which ends on Thursday.
Although numerous strategies and economists are of the opinion that FOMC could approve an increase in earnings on the occasion of this meeting, transactions in the term indicate a probability of only 25%.
"In our study since 1950, all the growth cycles of the interest rate so far have been in a super profit growth cycle, GDP eclipsed the peaks before the recession very quickly after the recovery began," the report said.
On the other hand, this was a strange slow recovery after the most serious recession in the period considered.
The current cycle is far from the longest expected by Fed since the end of the last recession; the memory has been lost for 35 months, and it has reached 74 months and continues.
The fixed income was also volatile given that the market anticipates an increase in the interest rate and the type is somewhat similar to that of the dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of obligations than in the case of actions when Fed changes policy.
In the case of obligations, the benefits appear to change direction as soon as the first growth/down of the cycle occurs.
At the end of the growth cycle of the interest rate, the profitability of the bonds is falling immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab’s strategies are of the opinion that these growths in the interest rate will determine the approach to profitability between short-term bonds and long-term bonds by applying the curve.
High-efficiency obligations are better handled in such an environment, although "we are still careful about strengthening profitability," said Kathy Jones, a regular-income analyst in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones is of the opinion that markets have already adapted to Fed's policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the downsizing of the estimated inflation, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the perspective of a more rigorous monetary policy," Jones wrote.
The short-term interest rates have increased, the profitability curve is more accurate, the spread of the average interest rate of credit has expanded and the volatility has increased - all market characteristics when Fed is political.
In large lines, companies carrying out majority activity in the US will have to win as a result of the increase in interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debts will suffer as the increase in the dollar will result in their products being consumed in the global market and their debt will be cheaper.
"History shows that stock "quality" tends to be more profitable in the three months following an initial increase in the interest rate," analyst Goldman Sachs said in a customer report.
Companies with strong balances exceeded those with a weak balance after each of the interest rate increases of 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with large capital deposits and low-volatility stocks also exceeded companies similar to a lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points), respectively 3 (percentage points).
The debt will become an important problem.
Companies with a large percentage of fleeting debt have the most to lose, says Goldman.
Consumers will also gain from the increase of the dollar.
Economists could also have won, although experts do not agree on how fast this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, said MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised the radio post for "prostituting"
It claims that it is more and more similar to the commercial opponent
He also took the BBC Music Awards to the eye, claiming that British prizes were plagiarismed.
Comrade Damien Collins attacked The Voice, claiming that this issue is not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is "transformed into" Classic FM, said an important parliamentary, putting pressure on the post to prove that it does something that commercial posts do not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC leaders that the public radio post "prostitutes" and resembles the commercial opponent more and more.
"I feel that Radio 3 "prosecuted" - although I don't like using the word - but I feel that it turns into Classic FM," he said.
He also took the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
BBC Music Awards, released last year, seems to be British under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are the two examples that come to my mind that I do nothing but copy what already exists on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The director-general of the BBC denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is very much in front of his commercial opponent regarding live music and public education.
I'm not going to find out anything about the classical music I get from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rivals.
"In addition, I think it is also important to commit Radio 3 to discover new music and allocate new songs," he said.
In the first part of this year, BBC editor Radio 3, Alan Davey, said he had to make more efforts to attract audiences to the previous period because the British have less knowledge of classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only item under the BBC's seal criticised during the meeting of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport because it would follow its trade rivals.
Conservative parliamentary Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC-acquired talent show from Dutch producer Talpa Media for the sum of about 22 million pounds sterling.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about that issue because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - having Paloma Faith and Boy George in jury - be performed "in a specific way BBC."
He added that he wanted that Corporation to "find the golden egg pig in its own garden" next time he launches a entertainment show.
However, he refused to prohibit the future from taking over the new seasons of The Voice or spending the money going on licenses in other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales recorded the smallest growth in August and could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
In the last month, the slowest growth has been seen from 2000 to now.
Online sales took a long time three years ago, due to the use of the mobile phone to make purchases.
Experts are of the opinion that the Black Friday in November could determine the resuscitation of expenditure.
For over a decade, online purchases have exploded and turned commercial streets from the UK into ghost cities.
Experts say, however, that there are signs that online sales are decreasing, the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total amount of money spent in August has presented the smallest growth from 2000 to now, with an increase of only 5% in the last year.
Experts say that there are signs that online sales are decreasing, the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
"If we analyze the growth rate from previous years and turn back by 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalise over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG Sales Index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales took a long time three years ago, when buyers started using the mobile phone to make purchases.
Thus, it increased the number of people who could make online purchases and could do it under different circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that it's stagnating a little, you might notice a decrease (of growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
In the opinion of the experts, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event that took place last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers starved in front of computers to put their hands on offers, leading to the collapse of the websites of more retailers.
Specialists are of the opinion that Black Friday, when buyers fought on chilipires, could determine the retrieval of buyers.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that at least £ 1 in every £ 5 is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are currently being carried out through online stores.
At the same time, more than one quarter of people prefer to buy online clothes and shoes than to appeal to fashion stores in commercial areas.
After the Sanitation of the Bin Laden family, Muslims bury the victims killed after the massacre of the Meccan macara
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walked on Muslim streets, the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia partially defeated the giant in the construction of the Saudi Binladin Group for collapse.
Health Minister said a total of 394 people were injured following the collapse of the macara
In the street tour ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a macara crash at the great mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, the mourners joined the road to express their condolences, until the first death came at the end of the final journey, at Al-Moaisse cemetery.
The sad memory kept by the holy place, where only a few days ago a construction march broke through the mosque ceiling, falling on believers.
The bodies were released for funerals after the King of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the construction group of the Bin Laden family for disaster, which also fought 394 wounded.
In the ceremony held on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a macara crash at the great mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, found in his first pilgrimage when the macaraca broke down.
Mr. Akram is in the Great Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Binladin Group should not have left the macara arm raised when the macara was not in operation.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the Swedish Press Agency, said the Binladin Group partly bears the guilt for burglary.
The English news agency's service did not present that detail, but stated that the company's leaders had been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to reveal what caused the macara to collapse in the court of Mary Mosche, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the Hajj pilgrimage that took place later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the collapse of the macara and the Group's representatives have not been able to contact for statements.
The Royal Decree blamed the group for not using updated security measures and did not coordinate its activities with the meteorological authorities.
Ten masks surrounding the Great Mosque in Mecca, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For a few decades, the Binladin family has a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and is conducting major construction projects.
The last leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a "refused" son, disembarked by family in the '90s.
The eruption occurred in strong wind and rain conditions, with only a few days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, the essential journey at least once in the lives of each Muslim physically fit.
The authorities state that 158 people remain in the hospital.
The authorities have decided that the families of the deceased receive a million of the Saudi Rials (174,000 lire sterling) and the same amount to be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other wounded will receive half of this amount.
Advantages and disadvantages of the conversion of credits into Swiss francs
On the bank market there have already been two bids for the conversion of credits into Swiss francs, the main advantages being the exclusion of the foreign exchange risk and the reduction of the rates.
The disadvantages can come over a few years, when the variable strain can lead to increased rates.
The Bank of Transylvania has just completed the process of converting credits into francs granted by Volksbank, and Bankpost has announced a conversion offer for its own customers.
According to data collected by Finzoom's financial portal analysts, Bankpost offers three years of fixed interest on the market, 1.5%, the smallest on the market.
On the other hand, the transfer offer of the Transylvania Bank was accepted by 83% of free credit clients due to the second successive reductions: the balance was reduced by the value of the risk and administration commissions paid by the client, then an additional reduction of 22.5% was applied to the balance in law.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, the girl who pays equivalent monthly in lei before conversion.
Thus, Banka Transilvania reduces the rate by 42.5% and Bankpost by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the credit cover in the CHF is that the foreign exchange risk is eliminated, the consumer being protected by the future interest rate of the franc, and the repayment of the credit will be made in the currency in which it is paid.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that property re-evaluation is not done, additional guarantees are no longer required and another proof of income.
In practice, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the credit and no additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
Both banks also offer a reduction in the monthly rate, the face of which the customers paid prior to conversion, equivalent in law.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first few years is more than the doband format, and the customer repays very little mainly.
The Bankpost offer with a very low bid in the first three years seems beneficial to customers.
But they don't know how this experiment will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be greater than 3.25%, so, overall, and the cost reduction is smaller.
A possible risk for all credits in lei with variable bond, is that the ROBOR indices will rise significantly over the following years (more than the Libor - CHF indices).
For example, ROBOR three months ago is 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached 6%, in 2009, more than 15%, and in a few days 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, it is possible to meet other costs, not mentioned in the initial offer.
The time has come for the US Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions
The world looks forward to the scheduled meeting in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will make a crucial decision whether to increase or not the interest rate for the first time after about a decade.
In a survey conducted by Reuters with the participation of 80 economists, less than half of which thought the decision would be taken last week, I now believe that the situation will continue for a while and that the interest rates will be kept in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought the rates to zero.
For the first time, we face a situation in which a major central bank could give up the zero rate and initiate a process of normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, head analyst at Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has evolved relatively well, raising trillions of dollars in the balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
However, the Federal Reserve should not ignore the global situation less pink.
It warned markets to prepare for growth, but there are signs that even they think such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
You see that they lost their charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has experienced stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 she struggled with leukemia and in 2009 lost her life partner, Farrah Fawcett, in front of cancer.
It also appears that the actor would have faced the problem of drug use and that in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly has a cost.
The player Luke Shaw from Manchester United is at the bar for a few months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture at the right foot in the game played by Manchester United in the Champions League, ended with a defeat in front of PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eyes and that will keep him on the bar for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The accident occurred following an unholy intervention by Héctor Moreno in 15 minutes, after Shaw, 20 years of age, broke the PSV defense.
She received medical attention for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before she went to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has double fracture on his feet and is in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe he'll be in Manchester.
It's awful - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, has a hard time, then plays fantastically and now something like that happens.
He's got his oxygen mask in his vest.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but at the double fracture, rest is six months and it won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
It seems that Moreno was lucky and escaped from the red cartridge and the concession of a sentence.
Arbitrary Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge yourself when I say it's falut and red cardboard.
It was a very ugly intervention, with two legs.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: "Thank you all for the messages, I have no words to express how weak I am, start the way to recovery, I will return stronger."
Similar news: Manchester United hit Luke Shaw's accident in defeating the PSV
The foundation of the team of England has an additional reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next year in June.
Phillip Cocu, coach PSV, said: "It's a very bad accident."
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an accident.
Our players never want an opponent to happen.
Moreno broke his foot playing for Mexico national against the Dutch national led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Championship.
"It's very hard for him because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it's a very serious accident, it's not good," Cocu said.
I didn't see the stage.
I managed to see only the ball, which was heading in a different direction, so it seemed that [Moreno] touched it but I could not see the intervention on Luke.
In the statement for SBS6, Moreno said: “I know what it is, I know how difficult it is to get through this.
I feel stupid, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player, Andrés Guardado, also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth clearly risked England's emissions, but it's still strong
The victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, however, after seeing the team selected by England for the tournament, I do not take into account a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in the test matches.
I wouldn't eliminate any variant of a mover.
Perhaps Alastair Cook's team has less experience than three years ago, but has good players on the spin in the beating line and collective morality is strong; they will not be marked by the 2012 events and will have a young positive attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even if it is unknown at the test level, it is an option for attack.
Similar subjects: Adam Lyth left England team for test games and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his principal coach in Yorkshire, it's hard for me to analyze the decision not to select Adam Lyth on the team.
He played the seven test games against two good attackers, under difficult conditions, and the simple reality but hard is that cricket players are judged by results.
There were no questions about Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said this before - players are their own selections.
Some fifty years and maybe Lyth would have extended his run, but his destiny is in his hands.
I hope if he does more runs for Yorkshire he'll have other opportunities.
The chief coach of the team of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised her attitude even when performance was not in the measure of her ability and does not surprise me; first of all, he is a teamman.
It's hard to answer the question as long as a batsman is noticed in the test matches.
Lyth had seven runs--like Sam Robson before him--while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton had good luck at home and on the move.
The only disappointment you could have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tour - when Lyth was in maximum shape - but that missed occasion is from the past.
The team's got Alex Hales, a batsman I'm very good at.
He's a cricket player who has the "X factor" and that I noticed earlier in Yorkshire this season when he marked 236 against us at a pitch Trent Bridge.
It should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but this will, of course, depend on the membership of the UAE team.
The idea was launched that Moeen would open up to battle alongside Cook, which would lead an extra spinner keeping at the same time four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a thrower couldn't hit there and this left-wing player has already shown that it's fucking given up.
Maybe Moeen didn't bring success to his district, Worcestershire, but it was No. 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 games test 38 as first drop before entering open in 2001.
He immediately wiped out three centuries and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team on the back-up spinner and, although I had a limited contact with him, I was struck by the fact that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his fragile age - with an average of 31 at the beat and 35 at the ball - and they might think it's a point, but there's no bunch of sprinklers, and the selectionists opted for the youth.
He'll learn a lot from this tournament.
England has also made a number of changes to the training team.
The name of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan batsman, as consultant for the test matches could be a master's hit.
It is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that it has played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring both energy and unremitting ambition.
I always thought she was born to get involved in international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and just like Mahela, she has intuition.
Sometimes, new voices in the lobby, even if they transmit messages that have been transmitted and previously, can bring fresh air into the team.
Colly Durham's teammate, Ben Stokes rest for one day's games, Root got a similar break against Australia and I don't have a problem with this.
Although not all agree, coaches and selections do not do the program.
And you have to keep, the jobs of the players depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never made easily.
Brexit Tabara could have a cause if the economy is kept in acalmy until 2017
Every day, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to maintain Britain in the EU is becoming increasingly in the way, even without the choice of genius Jeremy "Yes or no?" Corbyn led the Labour Party or the TUC to bring serious criticism to Europe Tuesday.
Foreigners have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained last day that - buried in a crisis similar to that of the EU - not all are caused internally - some Member States are fed with the British agenda for concessions and amendments to treaties, which most do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, the TUC decided that they would not want to do so if they were to exodus social protection.
We could even call Dave and George's "selfie" agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor participate in bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants a Great Britain with a view to the outside under the EU roof - "Do not leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that more ministers and officials from certain capitals have reached the point where they don't care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, an extremely careful German Chancellor, is an ally who has been on the run for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation gets worse, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have stayed too long.
In 2017, French President François Hollande will be real or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland could soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It is hard to believe that they will help the pictures of English, whose energies would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving Britain - something they do not want because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers might even plan to make intentional remarks that do not help, in the SNP style, in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"The renegotiation has been fixed" and "The Great Britain has not obtained anything of the value of renegotiation".
Europeans know on their skin how attractive Fleet Street can be and how skeptics are the Baronists of the oligar press who are looking at the EU with skepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry into report 2:1.
I may recall Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was a correspondent in Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of unpaid tax pockets, foreign people who cheated on phone and pseudo non-homes who hold most of the important newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw her quite the same but realized that when you're locked in a cage next to a nervous gorilla, you have to give her bananas to distract her from the thought of eating you at lunch and again at tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blair than Blair in the opposition to Cameron's referendum idea, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who offered him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me on the back of months at Westminster - I told him not to waste his time with me - seems to be in danger of adopting the ou Murdoch boycotting strategy of Neil Kinnock in the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take a long time, but it must develop a coherent strategy of media cooperation, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose position at the BBC has left a Sunday holiday.
Corbyn's official position towards Europe is what I would call evolution with pleasure.
It states that it would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who disagree with the "Englishism" of conservatives might agree with that.
That's what Hilary said, "Un Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on radio and TV this week, when his researcher fought not to recognize that John McDonnell's name by Corbyn as minister of financial problems was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 1970s, when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to his lab colleagues, without going too far and without losing his job in the office.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not match what McDonnell said and did not match what JC told colleagues and parliamentarians at the private meeting of the night.
Regardless of the image Corbyn wants to convey - keep it, he also made me feel sensitized - the discipline of messages remains important in the age of television and especially in the age of social networks, a fire of paranoidness and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a ticket of favor in Europe, allowing him to take good support for the workers in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
However, McDonnell and Corbyin's basic sophism on the quality of EU members - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for which small-difference narcissism is a central dogma.
As with his sophimism about NATO - Tom Watson - it is absurd that the JC will not campaign for resignation - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - and there are suspicious voters - for concessions to the UK when everything could be useless?
The US is already quite disappointed about the poor military performance of the English in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as I recalled at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum Monday.
Experts criticise the decision of the English Department of Public Health on electronic cigarettes
According to researchers, the claims of a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them linked to the tobacco industry.
Experts from the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the publication Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by the Department of Public Health in England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
The PE published the "reference report" last month and described it as a "complex analysis of the evidence".
Several researchers, however, questioned the data robustness and showed the finger to the links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in Lancet's medical journal attacked the "extraordinary fragility base" on which the PHE founded its main conclusion.
Two other researchers who wrote in the BMJ have put their claims and their foundation on "solid soil or on moving sand".
Martin McKee, professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said it was expected that the PHE claims according to which "current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting attended by 12 people led to the development of a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) that summarised their views on the negative effects associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were presented briefly in a research work.
McKee and Capewell either claimed that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose executive director was said to have received funding from the British American Tobacco to conduct an independent study.
It also validated the public health accreditation of BAT in a sustainability report, it stated.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared the funding received from an electronic cigarette producer but not the funding that there are reports that it would have been received from the tobacco and tobacco producer company Philip Morris International.
No arguments were provided on the basis of which members of the panel were selected, but among them there are several "frequents" known in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even declare in the work of financing the industry.
Other participants in the meeting are not known for expertise in tobacco control.
At the meeting, he also participated in the head of the control section of the tobacco within the PPE.
The research work developed by the group "mushalizes convincingly" the lack of "solid evidence of the harmful effect that most products have in accordance with the majority of the criteria," said McKee and Capewell.
However, the PPE report does not mention any of these links or limitations.
McKee and Capewell said the PHE claims that "until now there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the Health Department of the PPE, said that he had responded to BMJ's claims in the past.
He said: "Electronic sparks are significantly less harmful than smoking"
One of the two people who have smoked all their life loses their lives because of this vice.
All evidence suggests that the risk posed by e-cigarettes for health is lower compared, but we must continue to study long-term effects.
The PSE has a clear duty to inform the public about information which is returned and which is not returned from evidence, taking into account in particular the high level of public confusion regarding the relative dangers of tobacco.
Every year, about 80,000 people lose their lives because of a disease associated with smoking and the annual costs of the national health system due to smoking reach 2 billion pounds.
Expressing clearly the current evidence - that even though the use of electronic cigarettes is not at risk, they present only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national duty.
Illegal torture equipment - delivered to the door!
Claims that shame the British arms trade
Follow the film made by Amnesty International against the arms trade.
Terrible killer drones!
The iron to tear the glaciers apart!
Dispersion bombs!
And electric sticks that cause inflaming pain without leaving a trace!
The joyful voice and animated images do not doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest arms trade is a bold shard made by Amnesty International to underline the British authorities' desire to sell weapons of repression regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

However, a separate campaign also led to the display of a large number of posts in bus stations and in metros that need a second look.
"An important ad, traveling with DLR between 15 and 18 September?" says one of the ad, using the fonts and branding of the London metro, the DLR line transforms itself into an image of a tank.
In September of this year, a large number of arms dealers will resign to DLR customers are asked to contribute to the cessation of the arms trade.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exposed the works at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a package of 6 lire Allen keys saying that "it facilitates access to about a third of the advertising space in the bus stations on the planet."
The transport region in London is not amused by this "vandalism" as wheeled.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and lecturer at Essex University, artists ask more and more questions and seek to make political works accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists turn to collaboration with activists in protest movements, realizing that they have to go into the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade that happens to the shipowners who circle with the subway.
The film made by Amnesty had over 100,000 Facebook views in 24 hours and was created by the advertising agency VCCP that worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and artist who duplicated the voice also worked for free.
VCCP's creation director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence around the armament advertising - with an empty space in ExCel's calendar - and thought, "We offer them the campaign that tries to avoid it."
They played with the realization of a more realistic advertisement, but "reriching it with strong animations and colors, it was more exciting".
"They did a great job helping us increase our interest in the sale of illegal torture equipment at the store," said Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now it would be necessary for the UK authorities to take measures and ensure that torture equipment is not marketed illegally and delivered at the door.
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the topic of the arms trade comes from within ExCeL, where exhibits offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab released an order received from the US army on "AT4CS RS with shoulder-supported launcher."
This includes “a single-shaped focus that provides forgetful effects behind the armor within the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be nice.
Eight golden rules to live in the house
It's been 11 years since I moved into my home, when I was a 19-year-old, who still believed in britches and moral relativity, but now I barely remember the strong smiles of those we were angry with - and the numerous complaints to others.
Most of the things I've learned can be summarized in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving into the house can bring conditions that vary from nervousness to horror.
It's tempting to tell people where you come from, if and where you spent a year of study break, what do you think about Corbyn and why "you don't care, Marmite because, for good boys, there's nothing but a HAHAA droid extract, you find me in my room."
Breathe deep.
And help others breathe - ask questions and show interest.
This animated conversation and helps you differentiate the people you like from those you don't talk to even if the crowd came and they were the only ones who would have boats.
Don't suffocate people.
Sleepers often enjoy parties with drinks, movie series and socialization meetings, but they are also the place where people dress and try their intimate lingerie.
Similar subjects: Don’t even think about starting your student’s life in a relationship
Introverts are part of special treatment at the university.
Your sleeper should be a refuge, but in many homes a perindation culture is built through bedrooms, based on friendship, socialization and friends who last their entire life.
All of this can be terrible for someone who's trying to charge their batteries.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say "I like you and I want to stay friends, but I want you to go to recover my energy I've consumed by interacting with you."
Try to sit when a colleague is exhausted by socialization - and try to send an SMS instead of knocking on the door.
When it comes to knocking at the door, do it.
A guy sitting in the same house with me had a policy that said if a door wasn't locked, then he was invited to come in.
He's seen enough things.
Make your friends cooking.
Since you're starting college in the Bake-Off February, if you knock on someone's door to get to know and take off and a plate with blacks, it seems less strange, less like the situation in the 1950s, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've prepared something for you, now smiles and I ask personal questions."
Good things prepared in the house are a great way to make you friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to sit down and may be able to associate your figure with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, you must be a well-known cook.
The beans, sugar and fat will most likely determine the others to pretend that I sleep when you knock on the door.
The food supply is a common crime in student homes.
Obviously, if you wipe someone's chicken is stolen, but if you take a drop of milk to put it in your tea is all stolen?
Ask the owner.
He'll probably tell you to serve yourself even if you're burning on the inside.
If someone steals your things, it's annoying and I understand you - try still to address the problem more mature than my roommate, who dyed her milk with liquid detergent to punish those who stole.
He's in jail now.
Do not make noises that do not allow others to sleep or study.
That's not just because it feels good, it's because you're going on your own.
A girl on the floor with me asked her neighbor to give the music more slowly because it was 3 a.m. and she had an exam in the morning.
Their reaction was to make music stronger.
When they stopped the music at the end at 5 a.m., the girl was kind and let her sleep two hours before going to the maximum music, locked the door and went to the exam that lasted three hours.
Wouldn't it be romantic if the future husband/wife would move on the same floor?
On the contrary, would it not be extremely strange if you were to confuse a pallier colleague with your future husband, have you married, split you apart, and should you meet each other daily and maybe even see how all common friends happen?
Of course, you can't resist the heart - but if a sexy palier colleague is certainly not your future husband, try at least to be rational.
At the moment you realize that someone left their keys in the locked room, the line between fur and intimidation is thinner than it seems.
A successful farce is fun, but it can damage in a few moments.
Provide a fun and valuable safety-related lesson by hiding something - but never dirty someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and put the keys in a glass of water you put on the freezer - but don't lick someone's roof goods more than twice.
Violent David Grimal: In Bach's time there were no world tournaments.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, artists and non-commercial representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our times, known not only as soloist but also as the initiator of a less common project, by the right "ciudad", as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra formed by international soloists and talented musicians, who interprets a symphonic repertoire without having a conductor, and that makes it at least a curiosity in the classical music landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two shows: a performance, Sunday, in which soloist was David Grimal, founder of the orchestra, and a month, when first-planned cellist Xavier Phillips was found, the works made by Enescu were unmissed.
Both shows, shown on Athens stage, showed the audience a different way of interpreting classical music.
Les Dysonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 and at that time was the only classical musical set where there was no director.
The director is the most important musician for musicians.
It is true, on the part of musicians, that they need an education to become soloists, or to become interpreters in an orchestra - speaking of instrumentalists, not composers.
They're trained as "specialists."
They insinuate that they need a director.
On the other side of the scene, for the public, all the musical fetishation is centered on the director.
And so, business, the music industry, it makes marketing.
So we're not talking about music anymore.
So if we look at this world, we have on one side qualified workers, what is stupid, and a public that cannot listen, but must look, what is stupid again," thought David Grimal.
The violinist tells us that this change in how music is made came after the "musical detachments" of his soloist career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise all over the world with different orchestras, to earn a lot of money and to bring money and music industry.
After 10 years, when I was about 30 years old, we found this very depressing, because we no longer found human creativity and brotherhood in this system.
So I've never found any meaning to continue this way.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This is happening in 2004, and at that time no one would do anything like this without a director: "The music world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects".
"How do you imagine you're marketing with a collection of musicians where there's no ego?" the artist asked.
David Grimal admits that Les Dissonaces is "a luxury", stating that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depends on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of the existence of the whole, the lack of a director has not proved to be a clue in the musical act: "I am curious about how we sing a more complex repertoire, as it seems, because all musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not just in the role," says Grimal, adding that at Sunday's show "I was 74 conductors on stage".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave", just because it invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where there are the largest orchestras in the world that sings 3 times a day, and in the midst of these orchestras you also invited this strange group".
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is the place and interest for something different, which breaks barriers.
Speaking of Enescu's work, the violinist admits that he feels Roman music of the famous Roman composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu's works to his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romance music, "for there is a George Enescu who made French music".
Grimal is fighting for the change in the way classical music education is made, considering that "the mass of musicians, as it is organized today, has an origin of death" and that "the future of music represents insatiable music".
We don't need to go around the world five times a year if it doesn't serve anything.
There were no world tournaments in Bach's time.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people working, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tournaments, launching albums, they're all amazing, but as long as they're done in the music service.
If not, we're in a system where creativity suffers, there's no freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave example to Romanian products before and after joining the European Union: "In Romania, before entering the EU, you have vegetables and good meat".
In order to enter the EU, health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat had to be adopted.
Production and agriculture are in the service of supermarkets, as is the case in France.
Music happens the same thing, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances make roses may not be very beautiful, but then when we cut them are real roses.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the centre and that the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
"If I consider - as do Koreans, Chinese, Japanese - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, I reintroduce its invasion into school, I reintroduce the concerts on television and through this education we would no longer need to sell music by sub-produced," Grimal thinks.
Surely there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that is all over it, something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician to a soldier, or if we form a musician who will sing an instrument, being, first of all, a musician.
We're talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) in a way, if we want to form a musician, it's all about something else.
In your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?", asked the French artist Zambind.
Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of some other way of making music comes just from exceeding this status of "soldier", the overcoming of what "they think are their limits": "The musicians discover at some point that they are not soldiers, and therefore after concert they come out of the ranks."
David Grimal spoke about the project or musical and about his vision of music and the artist at the "Festival of Ideas", a discussion with the public organized at the International George Enescu Festival by the Aspen Romania Institute.

Cinema City is looking for "Milie Voci Mari"
Cinema City launches the biggest challenge for children: doubleing two characters from the super-production "Cryasa Zápezii 3D"
Do you have a super talented and spontaneous child who likes movies?
Offer her the chance to get a star.
In September, in the newest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to reach future stars and who are between 8 and 16 years old, Cinema City is looking for "Micile Voci Mari", offering them an extraordinary opportunity to double two characters from a famous animation film.
If the classical drawings focus on the voice of the actor of the animated character in the last period, account shall be taken of the creation of the story and those who are going to interpret the voices, and they are usually very well known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that's why we start a unique campaign.
We want to find the right voice and provoke parents to register their children at our competition.
They'll have a special experience, because characters are nice and replicas are funny.
"The children will have fun and will have a real chance to be part of a team of actors," said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, during September 11th - September 30th, Cinema City organizes a selection of 10 children (five girls and five boys) who will have the opportunity to give a test in a recording studio with professionals.
All you have to do to parents is access the platform.cinema-city.ro, where to register the child at the contest and prepare it for the voice test.
Later, he must choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child will read and then the child will record by interpreting his own version of the duplicate.
Four films about friendship, bass heroes, magic and hope can choose competitors to support the test: "Pene Galbene 3D", "Mune: The Guardian of the 3D Monday", "Blinky Bill: Koala the Famous 3D" and "Albinuta Maya 3D".
Finally, the most talented two children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream fulfilled and will double a character from the super-production "The Snow Queen - The 3D Zappezy Life", which will have the premiere in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx wins are mixed, due tax forecasts for 2016
FedEx has declared disappointing results for the last quarter, the delivery giant reducing profit estimates for the year as a result of low demand for transport services and increased costs for its terrestrial transport division.
The company also stated that it intends to employ around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
In the same period last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company's shares decreased by approximately 2.5% in pre-market transactions, 45 minutes before the sound of the Wednesday's opening bell.
FedEx Corp. stated that it is expected to win between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May of next year, with 20 cents less, according to a previous estimate.
Analysts suggested a $10.84 figure, according to a FactSet survey.
The decrease is due to an increase in prices of 4.9% on average, with entry into force on 4 January and higher overtaxes for land transport of large packages or heavy weights, which will apply from November.
The company said it is still expected to increase its profits by the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of online trade.
The president and Director General Fred Smith said that "the company is facing a much weaker economic situation than expected, especially with regard to global production and trade."
Work plans for the holiday period were announced one day after the UPS competitor stated that it intends to employ 90,000-95,000 additional workers, approximately the same number of jobs it made last year.
In the quarter that ended August 31st, FedEx won $692 million, with 6% more than the previous year.
The share gains were $2.42, under an average estimate of $2.44 per share made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey carried out by Zacks Investment Research.
The profit increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the Zacks survey estimated the amount of $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, leading to the stagnation of the revenues recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online purchases has welcomed the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, the incomes of the Ground Division increased by 29%, but operating revenues have practically stagnated due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenues due to higher basic rates, while the revenues recorded by the Freight division decreased due to the increased costs.
At the pre-market transaction, about an hour before the opening sound, the FedEx shares decreased by $3.85 or 2.5%, to $150.15.
Tuesday at low closing with 11% at year level and 17% at maximum record on 11 June.
On the occasion of the most anticipated meeting in recent years, the federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week around a 27-foot meal of Mahon Honduran to decide whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, at the end of the Central Bank's sitting room, a wall painting of the United States will be erected.
The map is intended to remind Janet L. Yellen, President of the Fed, and his colleagues to place the economic interests of the nation above anything.
The Central Bank has received a double task from Congress: to maximize the employment rate in the US and maintain price stability.
But since the great economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in a decision too difficult to anticipate, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the US economy is prepared to be disbanded by the unprecedented incentive offered by the short-term interest rate almost zero in force from the end of 2008.
Even if most data indicate a strong growth economy, the recent excitement of global financial markets could scare Fed officials already careful about adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - even with only one percentage point.
"Evidently, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main aspects to follow," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co brokerage firm.
"I believe, however, that if they were to seek an excuse not to increase the interest rate, the uncertainty in the growing world market is sufficient to provide them with arguments to expect more," he said.
There is no consensus as to the decision that Fed will take, which in itself causes instability on the financial market.
About half of the recent economists in Bloomberg have anticipated an increase in earnings this week.
However, financial markets are expected to slow down, a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a decrease in the stock exchange if the Fed increased the interest rate, unless those who develop policies would slow down the impact by promising that it would go a long way to the next growth.
Tuesday, industrial media Dow Jones went 228.89 points, or 1.4%, up to 16.599,85.
The advantage was triggered by expectations that the Fed decision factors will maintain the stable earnings rate this week, said John Lonski, the economist chief at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising for Fed to increase the interest rate at this time," said Lonski.
If the Fed decision-makers do this, "they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic on financial markets".
Other experts have stated that an increase in the interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty about the moment the Fed will act.
Only a month ago, the Fed seemed to be about to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards slow down the monetary conditions that would confirm the U.S. recovery force.
Yellen said in spring and early summer that it was expected to increase the rate of earnings this year despite the concerns raised by the liberals such as the need for more economic progress.
Although job creation slowed down in August, the increase in the labour market was strong this year.
The unemployment rate decreased to 5.1% last month, the lowest rate in more than seven years and close to the level considered by the Fed as total employment.
Wages have shown signs of growth.
And although inflation has continued to fail to achieve the central bank's annual objective, the Fed decision factors have stated that a key reason was the temporary effect of oil prices in a sudden decline.
The economy "may face higher rates and needs them, given the pressure on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, global financial markets began to go into fibrillation at the end of this month, after China lost its currency.
The industrial media, Dow Jones, dropped by 16% below the record reached in May, as investors were afraid that slowing the Chinese economy would lead to global growth.
The market has receded somewhat this month, the Dow indices are now about 10% below the maximum in May.
For the Fed decision factors, market agitation is added to the complex calculation of the time of growth of the interest rate.
"Without what has happened on the financial markets and news about the weakening of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, it would be more firm in the meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and was official Fed.
Now, he expects them to wait at least a month to manage the effects better.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy and almost no data to be based on subsequent events in China," Oliner said.
The welfare of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so practically no decision-making should be taken.
But in fact, Fed has become a global monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
The President's simple allusion since then, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, that the Fed could "ingusta" its monetary expansion has launched an earthquake on world-wide markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, it is expected that Fed officials not only monitor progress in other areas, but also consult other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
Its decision-making process is "more art than science," Zachary Karabell, head of the Global Strategy Department of Investnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that "Fed has a reaction story oversized to changes in the financial market that seem to have nothing to do with economic bases."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Commission, a decision-making body that supported the increase in the interest rate, offered as an example the 1998-99 decisions.
A financial crisis affecting Asia has led the Fed to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "in spite of the implications of limited identification for U.S. development," Laker said.
A year later, Fed officials came back on those losses.
The Fed should put the issue of financial stability first only in the event of a major crisis, such as the market crash in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, a member of the Bank of England's interest-setting committee.
The last troubled period is not rising at that level either, he said.
"Of course we don't want to get in the situation of fearing an increase in earnings because markets have upset," said Posen, President Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in this respect, I do not think that it should take early action.

Seven's Sunrise dominates the polls, despite the attempts by the Nine channel to broadcast today's show about changing the party's leadership
The urgent displacement of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to convey on the subject of the consequences of the changes from the leadership of the Liberal Party did not bring a significant increase in the hearing for Today.
The morning broadcast of the Nina channel passed from the capital after Tony Abbott was defeated in front of Malcolm Turnbull.
The competition issue, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was held in London as part of a series of broadcasts conducted over several weeks, including Dubai, New York, Niagara and Cancun.
This "cross" of the distance did not seem to count too much for viewers Aussie TV, Sunrise having an audience of 397.000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today has seen a slight increase compared to the monthly hearings (317.000) and last March (283,000) but the figures were smaller than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has minimized the difference to Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and the Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference ranged between 40,000 and 50,000.
Meanwhile, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
That's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
This morning, not just Parliament is affected by the current change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

The main news was the dazzling start of the 800 Words series by leading the former Star in Packed to the Rafters, Erik Thomson.
The new drama, being the subject of a recently widowed father, who decided to move together with his two children on the New Zealand coast, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson was able to do a show alone without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The hearing results for last night responded responsibly that 'yes'.
The X-factor show transmitted by Seven was maintained in position, with 1,136 million viewers, taking easily the shows The Block (838.000) and TBL Families (726.000).
Seven recorded Swiss and descents on the second night she broadcast The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new general culture show had on average 446,000 viewers.
The second half of the hour (17:30 to 18:00) entered 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory in front of Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613.000).
Last night, the first half hour of the show The Chase Australia had an average audience of 520,000 viewers and the second half recorded a huge figure of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The decrease of the hearing recorded by Chase Australia on the second night will provide silent confidence to Nina that the Hot Seat will finally triumph at 17:30.
The Chase Australia replaces a million dollars minute, a show that failed to win McGuire's show.

4 people lost their lives after the police shot rubber bullets in Protestants in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bullets in the majority who demonstrated against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred on Tuesday night in Rupandehi District, approximately 280 km west of the capital of Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the head of the district police, more than 1,000 Protestants gathered in front of a police section, and some of them threw stones and molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said police forces used tear gas after shooting fires in the air before using rubber bullets.
According to that statement, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill, are usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
Ciocination was the last event after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group said that the new provinces established under the new constitution would divide their political influence.
Protests also existed in the west of Nepal, where the ethnic group Tharus wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in violent riots launched on 10 August,
when four important political parties signed an agreement for the country's division in the province - a major step towards a new constitution but an extremely controversial problem in Nepal, a central government country for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution was delayed in 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, legislators voted on the terms of the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We won't use wire fences, dogs, cops and guns
The Prime Minister continues to exchange replicas with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the Wednesday government meeting, Ponta reiterated Romania's firm stand against the refugee crisis.
We make every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democracy measures, watchdogs, wireguards or gunmen.
"It's a shame for Europe 21 to apply methods from the 1930s," said Victor Ponta.
"The Prime Minister further said that all data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and settled at the CSAT meeting on Thursday." the Prime Minister concluded.

Another well-defined front of low pressure approximately half the distance between Cape Verde and Lesser Antilles also presents a 60% probability of forming a tropical cycle over the next two days, added the meteorologist in Miami.
Weight reduction surgery may be useful for mild obsessive diabetics
Benefits of weight reduction surgery in mild obstetric patients with type 2 diabetes may be maintained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether mildly obsessive diabetes survives more after the surgical intervention of weight loss than those following non-surgical treatments.
"It takes a lot of time to centralise mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, as she wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Operations for weight loss, named and bariatric surgery, use different methods to minimize stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been performed on subjects with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (MIC) 35 or above.
The BMI, a weight unit relative to height, is considered normal in the range 18.5-24.9.
The BMI value of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and those with more than 30 BMI are considered obese.
You can calculate the IMC by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at the General Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used narrow data after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy in manchon - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The mean BMI in people who had surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 until the end of the fifth year in the study.
In the meantime, BMI remained close to the same level in people who received non-surgical treatment against diabetes, namely 29.
Among those who have had surgery, diabetes has been cured to 36% and partially to 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes was completely cured to only 1% and partially to only 2% of subjects.
In addition, control of blood pressure, triglycerides and LDL “bad” cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group”, the authors concluded.
Researchers have also monitored the blood levels of the A1c haemoglobin, which reflects the level of glucose over time.
Researchers say that the optimal haemoglobin of A1c is below 7%.
Following surgical intervention, the mean haemoglobin A1c decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the group treated with medical methods, approximately 8% were maintained.
However, this improved “glycemic control” - reflected in the improved levels of haemoglobin A1c - did not reduce the rate of mortality to five years, according to the chief researcher, Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgical intervention.
In the fifth year, compared to the gastrectomy group in the manchon, the surgical intervention group bypass lost more in weight (18.7 to 14.2 kg), recorded more significant decreases in BMI (7.4 to 5.1) and A1c haemoglobin (3.1% to 2.1%) and presented a higher probability of complete remission of diabetes (46.9% to 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study carried out on people with high weight in Sweden that surgical intervention prolongs life, says Blackstone, from Arizona University, the Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who suffered bariatric surgery had a probability of dying about 29% less after 15 years compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a benefit in survival in patients who suffered surgery, Blackstone said it is an optimistic aspect for people with BMI below 35 procedural interests.
"This is the point where this work is critical, because it claims that this surgical intervention is safe in the lower BMI group", without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, it claims.
Blackstone added that their patients and doctors should start taking the weight seriously when the patient's BMI reaches 27-30.
"I think we wait too long until we ask people to take this matter seriously," she said.
I think once these genetic changes have been accumulated that have shortened their bodies by predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it is extremely difficult to get back to normal.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all the refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
Tibetan Buddhist leader has issued an appeal to end the violence in the refugee's mother countries.
Dalai Lama spoke about the current problem of the refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He said that, in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail in the interests of every nation and even of every continent.
He also stressed that although admirably, the country's response to the refugee crisis in Western Europe is inadequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"It is a great concern for a few thousand refugees, but we must at the same time consider long-term solutions to bring peace and genuine development, especially through education, to Muslim countries," he stressed.
In the end, we need to consider ways of reducing crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force never solved these problems," he added.
Referring to the problem of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following the terrorist attacks of 11 September, claiming that the violent response from the US generated an uncontrollable chain of events.
After the events of 11 September, I sent condolences to a letter addressed to President Bush and told him to resolve this problem without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong, but he used the force and generated unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
4-fold increase in the number of children who have been ingested in the hands for the last 4 years
According to the Centre for Anti-Terrorism in Georgia, U.S. anti-Terrorism centres reported an increase of approximately 400% from 2010 on the number of children under the age of 12 who swallowed detergents with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gailord Lopez, the director of Georgia's Anti-Oventing Centre, cases of ingestion of hand detergents in children under 12 years of age reported at the anti-ovulation centres have risen from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children have more frequent access to these products and, unfortunately, a percentage of them reach the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said some children drink deliberately and others do it to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
YouTube can be followed by films that present teenagers as drinking detergents to create cheap drinks.
Teenagers seem to have mixed the detergent with alcohol to get a bigger drink.
Small children can be attracted by the attractive smell of the detergent.
"A child doesn't think he's hurt," says Lopez.
Many of the most attractive types (handwashing) are perfumed.
Hand detergents with aroma of mushrooms, grapes, oranges are the most attractive for children.
The hand detergent contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in small children, only a few swallows can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's very concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Center for Anti-Hungary at the University of Kansas, for the Fox 4 channel in Kansas City.
So we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these detergents in accessible places and if the little ones get to them, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested the equivalent of four spraying hands-derived sprays with scented caps, arrived in the emergency room to receive treatment.
He had alcohol179, twice as much as the threshold at which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, a doctor in the emergency room who treated her at the Medical Guinnett Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaija's bustling and couldn't work when he got to the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate child hospital to identify the signs of brain damage, as the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaija's mother, told CNN.
He could have been fatal.
Lopez recommended to parents and teachers to use wet products or services without alcohol and not leave the detergent at the expense of the children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with death.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing detergent hands containing an undeclared toxic ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three students of the fourth class of the North New York have schemed to poison their "hate" teacher by putting antibacterial products in class, according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand cleaning and banned him in his class room.
The police considered the plan to be "not meaningful" and turned the school inspector's disciplinary problem forward.
Rumour Mill: No misunderstandings at Celtic
Griffiths removes rumors about Celtic's misunderstandings, Deala admitting that Hoops are not at the best time, but they will come back.
Hearts faced with SFA regarding the allegations of Neilson and Warburton are concerned about the acquisitions in January that affected the team's unit
Dons grow the difference to Celtic at five points
The punishment of Adam Rooney in the first replay brought those from Aberdeen a narrow victory in front of those from Hamilton to Pittodrie, Dons getting a five-point difference between them and Celtic.
Griffiths dismantles rumors about misunderstandings
There have been rumors about misunderstandings in Celtic, dismantled by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team not be subjected to increased pressure because they are preparing to face the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we feel the pressure, I think players are just waiting.
Absence of Scottish in the race for title complicates Dutch - by Boer
The former middleman of the Rangers and former Dutch international player Ronald de Boer said that Dutch football supporters lost interest in Celtic - because they did not fight for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, now ambassador of the Ajax, said: “In the Netherlands, no longer transmits the summary of the Celtic games; why?”
Because there's no Rangers there.
Here, it's not just about the return of Rangers.
It's about Old Firm.
It's about both lootal teams and there's the interest.
The tension is great in games in Old Firm and not only Scottishs want to see these games.
I'll change the situation, Deala promises.
RONNY Deala agreed that Celtic is fighting out of the way, but the Norwegian chief promised to change the situation.
The defeat with Malmo and the subsequent elimination of the Champions League were followed by the defeat in front of Aberdeen, who played in 10 people, now in the top of the ranking with a five-point advance.
But Delilah said: "Celtic had periods before and will return".
We want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel the same way - but we have to go further.
We definitely need the support of the Celtics because so the players are getting better.
It's very important that we stay united now.
Warburton's skill in January transfers
Despite the comments just a few weeks ago that suggested that some targets would be identified for January transfers, the leader of the Rangers, Mark Warburton is worried when it comes to transfers, insisting that he does not want to affect the Ibrox team's unit.
The former chief of Brentford said: "The January transfer period is very different from that of summer."
In the case of players transferred summer, there is a period before the season in which they can be integrated, which you could observe in this season in our group.
The team's doing very well.
Sometimes you do worse if you bring players that aren't necessary.
Celtic is targeting Michu after retirement
Swansea's striker, Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested that he might retire at the end of the contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old player fought the ice cream problems for two years and failed to leave the Gale Country in the summer.
Hearts faced with SFA regarding Neilson's comments
Hearts drove with 2-1 when Patterson was removed and lost with 3-2, but the red cartridge of the foundation was then cancelled - the third red cartridge cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance."
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynacastle
The Invincible Hibee was taken over after admitting that he was singing a song with offensive verses about the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014, in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before a Derby with Edinburgh at Tynacastle.
"It was derby and it was the enthusiasm of the moment," said the striker, adding: "It is no longer necessary to say that I do not return to Tynacastle unless I play for Celtic."
The Council of Tanzania trusts the management of Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that those in the Dundee United Council still believe that the management team will change the situation - but it is agreed that the decline on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll bring the boys in shape again," Donnellly said.
McInnes is happy for "the dirty victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that the Aberdeen team must be desperate for Hamilton Accies to win the seventh consecutive victory in the league, which brought them five points in front of Celtic due to the beating of punishment from Adam Rooney's first rebuff.
McInnes said: "There is no team to win anything, in a cup or league, and not to win such games."
Unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged while Britain grows
WOMEN'S WORD in Scotland remains unchanged, being 164,000 in the period below, while the number of British unemployed has increased by 10,000, reaching 1.82 million in the same period.
The rate of unemployment in Scotland was 5.9% higher than in the United Kingdom, according to the figures presented by the National Statistics Office (UNS).
In the meantime, the employment rate in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three months, the number of employees currently being 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland decreased by 74.0% in that quarter - a figure above the average of 73.5 in the United Kingdom.
Scottish State Secretary David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The plan of the authorities in the long term has laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It's been almost a year since Scotland made a historic decision to remain a member of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, the employment rate of the labour force recording growth and the rate of unemployment decline.
Why I'm a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
During today's day, with the exception of a late legal intervention, I will look at how a man is sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be in a room for observers from the Oklahoma State Prison and I'll see how Richard Glossip is being executed by the administration of the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation came first in January, through his best friend, and, although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day draws closer with the story, my idea gets worse.
So why would I do that?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of the capital punishment.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true, journalists can be witnesses to executions in America and, because usually the requests exceed the number of seats available, there is a macabre lotterium to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma reduced the number of seats reserved for press representatives from 12 to five.
The electorate will look at the execution with impartiality.
I can't do that.
I'd stay next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I developed my own relationship with him over the months of telephone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to have a book and a pix to notice what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me of compromising my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he wants, he gets access.
I complained about her.
He acknowledged that "it could have been better," but it is still felt that I am wrong.
Richard Glossip did not agree with some of the things I said and wrote them.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it if I asked.
I told him he could get me out of the witness list any time.
But he wants to be present for an international report to write about the subject.
He thinks that, if he dies, publicity will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, reporter at Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about the case, listen to the multimedia file series that I've done.
I'm not coming back here for all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it's very likely he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll watch him die from this perspective.
I can't claim to be totally objective.
For this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll find out what it's like to look at a man who likes dying useless.
Peter Moody claims that the guards tried to spy on him and threaten to withdraw from the race
Peter Moody said that the racing squads were either trying to infiltrate a spy at his lawns last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the race.
He launched an attack on the guards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they were conducting a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the cup was the removal of Lady Daddy from the race because of a treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what was best for the course and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result of the Lidari's cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months, he swallowed up his words about spy statements and did not want to be "a wolf that doesn't reach the grapes".
"I wasn't going to say anything about that and I've been quiet for a long time, but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that it's all over again," Moody said.
It's known to have continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I have said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep quietly.
I want to go with my head up and I want the owners I'm working with to see that you're trying to give them everything that's better.
Since they're starting to think it's not like that, I have to give up on the coach job.
At that point, I'm gonna have to think about what I'm gonna do with my certification.
Previously, Moody threw the bomb into an interview for racing.com in which he said the Department of Integrity tried to spy on his grades.
"After eighteen months, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart stayed in a room next to a man - whose name I'll tell him if I'm asked - and offered to hire him to my grades to provide information about the activity there," Moody told Racing.com.
Of course he thinks I'm sad.
If so, then you should give all your resignation because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of the RVL, David Moodie, current president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, knew at that time and I know today.
Should I think it's personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to start having a vertical column and can pull people out of the trainers for what's going on in industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
Is my influence on the industry so bad?
Maybe that's how I see the others.
Maybe he'll have to take my license and give me a hand and I don't doubt that the statements I'm making right now might lead him to think about this variant.
But I got to the point where I don't care anymore, and that's what I'm talking about.
I'm very excited.
I'll put pressure on them and I'll decide to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The hairdressing of the coach increased once with the extensive investigation into the cobalt test in which Lídari was involved and the elimination led him to say that he could "put his license on the table".
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of the unwinded Black Caviar champion, labelled the treatment rule on the day of the race as "ridicola" after applying on the feet a cataplasm with nomeol or clay, which violates the rules.
Break the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he says.
One of my employees made a mistake on his feet.
It could have happened last night.
Could have happened yesterday, what happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could have been disqualified for three months for treatment on the day of the course, consisting of the use of the cataplasm, for which the stewars opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but it has gone too far," Moody said.
The driver who hit and ran from the crash site in Cobram was arrested
The police arrested a man after a collision with a biker produced in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by a flight from the site of the accident.
The biker was transported by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, being seriously injured after being hit on Saturday morning by a car on Murray Valley highway.
Police representatives declare that the driver of the vehicle did not stop to help the injured bicycle driver.
Monday, a 50-year-old man surrendered to the Shepparton police.
It appears that he will be accused of fleeing from the site of the accident, not offering first aid and other road offences.
The biker, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in stable condition.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, answers opponents to the charges of wrestling.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, referred to the criticisms of his team’s gambling tactics as “denatured subjects” brought into discussion of the main two favorites of the NRL.
Coach Sydney Roosters, Trent Robinson, said that the referees allowed Storm players to "get to the beach" the team in Storm's nervously won game at the end of the game played Friday night at Sydney.
The coach of Brisbane Broncos, Wayne Bennett, made an easy reference to Storm after the victory of his team in the qualifying match with North Queensland Cowboys, played on Saturday night, when he called that match a "ref show" of the rugby league and said that the two teams in Queensland don't get too much respect at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped to defend his team's betting tactics and said players simply focused on "contact" when they did.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two important coaches criticised his team, which means they were worried that Storm would beat him.
"And things don't stop here - I didn't hear Trent Robinson complain of wrestling when they beat us with the 24-2 score," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that I haven't changed anything every year in our defense systems or techniques, so much so that in the last six weeks, I've really put the focus on contact in payments and thus changed the situation.
Trent is in this function for three years and obviously has a wonderful team so he's probably not used to losing and was a shock to him.
We know how it always happens this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "shining the football", reminding his mentor St George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett won the 2010 championship by playing "placticing".
Wayne's talking about football palpitating.
And he argued by comparing the game on Saturday night with our game on Friday night and talked about how palpitant the game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St. George received a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and Wayne said he didn't care about any black under his nails.
But now he's got a team that can play what I think of being a football player, especially because of young rapists.
This kind of game you want to do when you have players like that.
He brought this argument in 2010, now wants everyone to adopt his style of game - not every team has two mediums like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're kind of worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably weren't thinking about us when they were thinking about important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the match between Storm and Roosters was a sharper match related to score compared to the match between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos match was probably a good match, I haven't seen him yet, how high was the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there have been two more trials, that's what it means to pulsating game?
Or do you mean take a break and don't walk?
For me, there are plans.
If I'm talking about us, it means we could meet him at some point.
Storm is free this weekend because they won the right to play at home either with North Queensland Cowboys, or with Cronulla Sharks, at the end of the preliminary Saturday, at AAMI Park, the tickets are placing on sale from the next March in the morning.
Steven Hogg used the girl's phone to accompany the pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for pictures of abused children.
Steven Hogg took the girl's phone when she was sleeping then authenticated into an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of improper images with children as a subject.
The girl woke up later and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while she was sleeping.
She looked into the phone and found disturbing messages after she immediately alerted her mother.
Upon arrival, the police saw the five photos then analyzed the computers found at that address and found "anxious" searches on the Internet using terms to find improper images with child subjects.
Hogg claimed he did it to "draw the pedophiles" on the Internet before "pretends he's a cop to scare them".
Prosecutor Elihid Robertson stated to the Dundee Court: “He said it is an addiction - that it is dependent on scare people.
He admitted that he did the computer searches, but he said he did it because he wanted to become a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations with the unknown person who sent his pictures and the fact that he asked that person to send other pictures.
He said he did it to suit.
He said he no longer thinks clearly when he drinks and wants to see his images with rapes and murders.
Mr. Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on the phone, she called her mother and cried and cried.
The girl saw the inconvenient images on the phone and the accused was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the accused used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Last year, on June 14, Hogg, at the age of 23, residing in Ward Road, Dundee, filed charges that he had made or photographed improperly with children, and violated the conditions of release conditioned on January 25 this year and did not appear before the court on 24 March of the current year.
The defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be registered in the register of sexual offenders because it can be said that this crime "did not involve a significant sexual aspect".
Judge Alistair Carmichael delayed the sentence until October for reasons of social reporting.
Hogg was released on bail in this file but remained in custody before the settings for other files.
It was passed on to the sex offenders' register before the sentence was given.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, gave the wrong speech to Parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
However, the filming of the fall has become viral on socialization networks.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disturbed by the opposition representatives who said that they would have received anonymous threats of death, threatening them not to mind Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they hated him during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The leader of the parliamentary group Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on mobile phones, being warned not to disrupt Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a hidden number, but it is called "death," he told reporters after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
It warns parliamentarians that immunity applies only in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer of value.
The leader of the parliamentary group said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "anxious" about the threats transmitted to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will make 30,000 availabilitys
It is proposed that Hewlett-Packard make available between 25,000 and 30,000 as part of the restructuring and cost reduction efforts in the services sector.
This year. HP will be divided into two companies on the stock exchange, separating the computer and printery division from corporate hardware operations and services that are growing.
The proposed availability will cost approximately 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, HP said.
"These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and sustainable structure with regard to costs," said Meg Whitman, president and CEO of HP, who will lead the unit after the break.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more concentrated than HP currently and will hold a wide business portfolio that will contribute to the transition of firms to a new business-based style," Whitman said.
Working as a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing requirements of our global customers.
According to a company's statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of over $50 billion and will "focus on providing integrated solutions without rivals" to companies.
A company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard is split, with the object of the activity of the production of electrical equipment and the garage in Palo Alto called the Silicon Valley.
HP went through a massive reorganisation to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The measure taken by HP, the second largest computer producer in the world and one of the largest US technology companies, is the most recent in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus their attention better in a direction have better performance.
FriendsFest: comedy series that taught us important lessons about men's friendship
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, given that the need for men to open is now more desperate than ever, suicide rates among young men reaching peaks in the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide represented the main cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the United Kingdom, and remains three times more frequent in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, Campaignn Against Living Miserably (CALM) designated 2015 as the Year of Men, wanting to put under the sign of the cultural question that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
The friendship is at the center of the struggle towards the success of this challenge.
A recent study conducted in more than 2000 high school students with symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends "with a healthy condition", his chances of recovery are doubled.
In the same way, for those who are not depressed, a circle of healthy friends reduces the likelihood of mental disorders to half.
Of course, in order for friendship to have effect, it must first be accessible.
In this era of communication dominated by social networks, where emphasis is placed on style and not substance, the immediate nature of the response often has priority before meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to entertainment and success, even if in reality isolation is the dominant one.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all with the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - which also affects our mental health.
The billionaire of a video game recently explained that money really doesn't buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it focused on this idea.
The characters were not defined by the place of work but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The murder of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the moments they look at football in the comfortable photos and Ross' passion for Rachel came from knowing that men can associate with this situation, even though they often tend to explore their feelings completely.
As one social worker explained to me: "My role in listening to people who tend to commit suicide and depression has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make the difference."
Often, people who call on us feel unable to talk to their friends.
The old age of dealing alone is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to my mind when I try to offer more psychological adaptation mechanisms in the long term.
The series highlighted little moments of friendship between men.
As much as it helps the objective intervention, externally, through the telephone, people who have arrived at times of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
So, if you're participating in this weekend's FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with the full editing of filming plates to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, and better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and greet.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - on the occasion #FriendsFest
Di Maria marches and helps PSG to give Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matudii and Edinson Cavani after marking against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria marked Tuesday in his first match in the Champions League and helped the PSG to push ahead of the Swedish Malmo team.
We continue to present the game's chronicle and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their duty, Paris Saint-Germain, starting a series of matches from the League of Champions groups, with a peaceful victory 2-0 against Malmo in the game played Tuesday on Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of his first match in the League of Champions in the PSG team, bringing France's champions to the advantage even though they missed a number of occasions before ensuring their advantage with the goal marked by Cavani in minute 61.
Coming to the A Group next to Real Madrid and Şahtior Donetzk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the goal of the French team is not only to qualify in the best but also to improve the journey to the final quarter in each of the last three tournaments.
However, although the points were taken, Laurent Blanc's students were away from a perfect painting, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who missed the opportunity of emptying out after being replaced by the team from his hometown and the club that started his bright career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win home or moving into the Champions League, so the 2-0 victory creates problems for our opponents and establishes a comfortable difference with the next class, even if there are other aspects that we have to perfect over the season," Blanc says.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did it, although I'm sorry we couldn't give one or two more holes.
Ibrahimovic returned after an accident to one of the three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 discount obtained from Bordeaux's house in League 1 in the weekend, but Di Maria took the light of the reflectors in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine offensive centre was named the man who will lead the PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he landed at Marco Verrati's pass behind Malmo's defense before shooting incredibly across Johan Wiland, in the long corner of the right gate.
But if someone like the PSG expected to get the victory a little bit out of their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-off to reach this stage and entered the ground with nine national teams, with a defense of five people and two defensive mediums, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except by making a shot of Nikola Djurdjic who passed by Kevin Trapp's post in minute 34.
Instead, the PSG players slowed down several times, giving a few unnecessary steps and not finalising the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed at least five trials only in the first replay and was then replaced by Cavani even after the game was resumed.
Ibrahimovic, however, proved himself much more understanding in support of his colleagues, his passport being the one that Di Maria sent in a miscarriage from Wiland over the gate in minutes 52.
The second goal was recorded in a final after an hour of match, due to Cavani, the Uruguayan who recorded the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic had passed from Maxwell's centre.
This goal removed the hope of Malmo's rebalanced score and only a great stop to Wiland's rejection of David Luiz maintained the final score before the new entry of Ezequiel Lavezi cancels an gap in the extension.
Norwegian coach of the Malmo team, Age Hareide, later said that the PSG was with a class over and that "The last match I played in the League of Champions was in December last year."
Since then, I've only played in leagues in Sweden, which don't rise to the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Down the hat for the PSG.
They made an excellent game.
Glencore strands $2.5 billion in stock sales
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by a drop in stock prices on the stock exchange, earned 2.5 billion dollars from selling shares as part of a comprehensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore, quoted at the London Stock Exchange, said he sold new shares worth 1.6 billion pounds to purchase the debt.
After he lost 57% of his market value this year, the company is moving on with the prices in the stock exchange collapse, as China's decline in economic activity influences demand and causes a market disaster.
The preferential right to subscribe increased the price of Glencore shares on the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday morning transactions.
The shares amounted to 2.77% to 131.60 yling in FTSE 100 indexes, which opened at a value of 0.69% higher.
Glencore has revealed the sale of shares worth $2.5 billion as part of the broader plans to cover nearly a third of the debt of $30 billion.
The company sold the new shares at the price of 125 mills per share, with 2.4% less than the closing price of March.
He got 1.3 billion shares out of the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concern over the increase in the Chinese economy in the long-term stagnation has led to a substantial increase in the prices of iron mining, with approximately half, and coal, copper and other goods have dropped by 20-40%.
Xi calls for a stronger expansion of the world economy
Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reformed group that the economy should open up further to the outside world to feed on growth.
"China must commit to attract foreign investment and expertise and improve opening policies," Xi said during the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group for the Further General Reform (Central Leadering Group for Deepening Overall Reform).
Promoting opening up and encouraging reforms will bring new significance and vitality and will bring about economic growth, Xi said.
The management group adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulations, the relaxation of customs control policies, the encouragement of state enterprises to absorb private capital and the reorganisation of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and areas of activity in which investments are not allowed.
The system will be tested step by step and improved by test programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will offer the market a more important role in allocation of resources, ensuring a legislative business environment and providing a wider market opening.
The authorities of the State will also weaken control over the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to manage their business.
According to the declaration, China will also allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open state-controlled sectors, several sectors will be open to private investment.

Immigrant Crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 immigrants drowned in Turkey's territorial waters on Tuesday after the shipyard in which they were shipwrecked.
Among the victims are 11 women and 5 children, reported AFP according to Yahoo News.
The boat is located in the Aegean Sea and is directed to the Greek island of Kos.
Turkey's Coast Guard has transmitted that it has managed to save 249 people in the shipwrecked ship, but their nationality is still unknown.
Last month, two other people died while trying to cross the Aegean.
Also on the weekend, 34 immigrants, including 4 babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Pharmakonisi, located 15 kilometres from the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat transports more people than its capacity, so it shipwrecked.
The route has recently become a popular one for immigrants who want to escape the war and heavy lives of countries such as Syria or Iraq.

"All the efforts to determine their weakness have been made," explains a spokesman of the company.

They must have one concern: it's to play football the best.
Technical details don't have to be their concern.
They have to value the talent.
This is what they want to do at the Football Academy 'Paul Papp'.

I understand Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to rule, all the party.
If he wants us to formalize through a Congress decision, we'll do it too.
There won't be any kind of emotion about that.

PSD announced when it will make a convention - what will be decided then

Asked if the hesitation about the application announcement has anything to do with the file, Dragnea said she didn't have this problem.
I don't have the problem you're talking about, but I think it's right and honest for all my colleagues in the party to tell me or not a candidacy at the moment when the date of Congress is formally established.
"It's the only motivation," Dragnea said.

He came here very often, at night, after 8:00 a.m., I pray to open his racket with St. Nicholas's mustaches and pray.
He said it was a great blessing to this church of Brancoveanu.
He said to me, "Brother Emil, think of this as Brancoveanu, Eminescu, Mihai Viteazul, who took the hand of Saint Nicolae."
"'You realize what a blessing for this country,' Vadim told me,' the priest told the parish.

Simona Halep is in front of a crucial decision for his career, and she is required to choose whether to continue or not to work with coach Darren Cahill.
The two worked this year under the Adidas Player Development programme, the Australian technician being alongside the novel only at the major tournaments.
Simona had only words of praise at Cahill's address, which seems to be the only coach who managed to impose himself on the sports capricious.

It wasn't normal, I wasn't respected.
Victor Piturca disassessed how Romania's national team split in the fall of last year.
The former voter testified that he did not understand the president of FRF, Razvan Burleanu, after he took the place of Mircea Sandu, and thus decided to leave the country.
Finally, he proposed to the head of the Federation to pay substantial wages to remain, but he was refused.
I'm not sorry for leaving the country right now.
Then I felt bad, leaving a job behind.
So I thought then it was good for me and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a picker, it wasn't normal, I wasn't respected, I didn't respect my job.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he found different opinions from the press about me.
He didn't change me because it was very hard at the time, with the results I had, plus it was the financial situation in the middle.
I kept working, everything went very well and probably changed his ideas.
But I wanted to go.
If he didn't want to stay, I proposed a contract.
We have around 400 and a few thousand euros a year, followed by around 600 thousand euros.
I didn't talk to Burleanu, but to his right hand.
"It was agreed, but only if we ended up first in the group," Victor Piturca said to Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from Romania's national in the fall of last year, although the team had good results in the Euro preliminary 2016.
The technician accepted the proposal to train in Saudi Arabia, he immediately took over the Al Ittihad group.

Although the 35-year-old man said he didn't consume alcohol, he was visible to be able to get drunk.
When he first accused me of being drunk, without being drunk, I thought she was crazy.

'It was awful, I didn't remember anything.'
In addition, his wife, who, although doubted for a while, eventually went with him to numerous doctors, remembered that Nick smelled alcohol.
The moment that put Nick's bums the hardest was when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, he discovered he had a three-time alcoholism over his legal limb, although one night before he only had one beer.
After years and countless investigations, Nick discovered that he was suffering from an extremely rare disease, auto-brewery syndrome.

Destroyed a Mercedes with a golf cross
A South Korean man destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest against the services he had on the dealer's side.
The man "attacked" his car with a golf cross, causing enough damage to get the car out of use, broadcasts BT.
The whole scene was filmed, and the clip came on the Internet, to the fun of those who saw it.
The man claimed that the car has defects that endanger his life and his family.
His opinion appeared when the dealer from which he bought the car didn't solve his problem, as agreed.
The government approved, on Wednesday, "National Strategy on Immigration for 2015-2018" and "The Action Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "a step in Romania's efforts to modernise the immigration management process in the national territory", according to a press release.
The source shows that the strategy aims to manage effectively the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and action guidelines that reflect policies set at European level, adapted to national realities.
Given the problems faced by the countries of the immediate neighbourhood of Romania, measures for the unitary management and consistency of the situations identified by the possible occurrence of an influx of illegal immigrants in the territory of Romania, generated by situations of political, social, economic or military nature.

The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reactivation of the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in the border areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.

Referring to the Action Plan in 2015, the Government appreciates that it is "a means of establishing concrete activities leading to the creation of a flexible system to stop the migrationist phenomenon found in growth".
Romania, at a European summit on the labour market
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria recorded the high increase in the total labour cost of the Member States of the European Union in the two-month period, compared to the similar period of 2014, according to data published on Wednesday by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
Indications refer to expenditure on staff of employers.
Thus, in the period April to June 2015, the total labour force cost increased by 1.9% in the European Union and by 1.6% in the euro area.
Romania, on top of three in the EU, increasing labour costs
The largest growth was reported in Latvia (7.9%), Romania (7.7%), Bulgaria (6.8%), Estonia (5.5%) and Lithuania (4.3%).
The only EU countries in which the hourly labour force cost dropped in the two-month period was Greece (less 2.9%), Cyprus (less 1.2%) and Italy (less 0.4%).
The increase in labour costs in Romania in the period April - June 2015 is mainly due to the increase in the hourly labour cost of industry and services, with 7.9% and 7.6% respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania recorded an advance of 5.8% of the hourly labour cost.
TVR driver activity report, rejected in commissions: Stelian Tanase risked resignation
Parliament's cultural commissions rejected the report of the Board of Directors of the Romanian Television Society on Wednesday 2014.
To reject the report, 17 MPs voted, one opposed the rejection ( Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the Permanent Bureaus.
They'll decide, probably next week.
The next full meeting will be debated.
"I believe that in view of this situation, the situation will be made relatively quickly," said Senate Culture Commission President Georgica Severin.
He added that "good feeling" as well as the TVR leadership should be present at this meeting, provided that no representative of the TVR leadership was present at the Committee on Culture.
It was a good feeling to be present for TVR's leadership because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or something like that.
The invitation was made to the CA members still tonight, with about an hour that I didn't know any new hours, but today, after the Bureau's meeting, I personally sent a fax to the TVR management inviting her.
I think at the time you're called, you're being paid budget, paid out of public taxes and you're invited to a committee meeting even if you don't like living.
"Because it is your duty to serve, you are in an institution under the authority of Parliament," Severin said after the Committees meeting in Parliament's culture.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed in the sitting on the basis of the negative opinion of the Committees on Budgets.
The debts we've seen as they went on, came up with the idea that this year would have been a day, but they didn't pay from the historical ones.
"I remind you that not because of my fault or someone else in these committees has lost that deal with the banks and the fiscal, they are clear management problems," Severin said.
He added that once the activity report has been rejected by the whole meeting, elections will follow for a new Board of Directors and it will elect the director-general of the institution.
I don't know who will be proposed for this function.
The wonders won't happen.
It is important to make political decisions for this institution to function.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that there will be a genius who will stay at the tail here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, full of Parliament, will, by their vote, choose with great enthusiasm the people who will run the TVR.
There must be people who know what's going on there, have experience and have a lot of correctness and respect for the girl of institution and tradition.
I don't know who it will be, if you ask me what qualities you should have - I feel good about the attitude of the employee girl because she's a small fraud that comes from employees, claimants, discounts.
"When it comes to such cases 50, 60, 70, something can be done and we talk about the financial situation that is a disaster," the President of the Senate's Committee on Culture concluded.
Even though he did not present himself to Parliament, TVR CEO Stelian Tanase sent a letter to the President of the Chamber of Deputies Valeriu Zgonea, asking that Parliament take into account a number of measures that could lead to the salvation and political independence of public television, including the numbering and indexing of the TV tax.
In writing, Stelian Tanase requests, in addition to the indexing of the TV tax, the modification and completion of HG 978/2003 on the rate for public television service, in order to update the provisions at the level of technological changes per day, as well as the regulation of the control procedure in the area of TV tax payment and the detection of contraventions and the application of sanctions and penalties.
It also prefers to issue a provision to ensure the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become SRTv's agents for the collection of TV tax, by involving ANRE in the regulation of this activity.
In his view, it is necessary to establish a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission in the event.
Stelian Tanase calls for a reduction in the VAT rate for the specific activities of the public television and for a 15% contribution to the CNC at the level of 3%, but also for an amendment to the law 41/1994, in order to obtain the possibility of budgetary/financial allocations for the purchase of major cultural and sports events - the World Football Championship, the Golden Cerbula, Eurovision.
He argues that SRTv will be unable to pay in the following months, given that labour law obliges the employer to enforce judicial rulings, even if they are not definitive, and wage rights are given priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has made constant efforts to reduce expenditure on staff and the production of TV.
"This reduced travel and other cost-generating activities, renegotiated a number of commercial contracts, and at the end of July the TVR News post was closed," the president's letter to the TVR appeared.
Tanase appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be resolved by its own efforts alone.
"Without the support of the state institutions - the Government, Parliament, the Presidency - Roman television will be found sooner or later in the impossible to carry out its public mission", the letter states.
The leadership of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture.
The generators of Vasile Blaga, sent to the court
The generators of Vasile Blaga, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, were sent to the court on Wednesday by the prosecutors of the Parchet on the side of the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
It is accused of tax evasion, in a file of approximately EUR 600,000, being under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on May 22nd.
It established the security firm Axis Corporate Security SRL, along with his mother in April 2009, one year after he married Vasile Blaga's daughter, Agathe.
The investigation re-examined the fact that, for the purpose of deducting taxes and taxes from the state budget, the representative of a company specialised in security services would have created an infractional circuit, consisting of several commercial companies, which would have revealed fictitious transactions.
"In fact, the company's accounts would have registered fake purchases of services, which, in fact, were not provided, the state budget being so damaged by around 600,000 euros," the Romanian Police explained in a press release.
The Czechs set up the fate of Sanmartean
Six of the Al-Ittihad Club have established the fate of the middle of Lucian Sanmartean.
Even though the Arab press announced that Sanmartean's division of Ittihad is imminent, the impressionr Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says this will no longer happen.
Boloni is very grateful for Sanmartean.
Lucian plays game title and does it well.
They realized that he was the best and that it would be wrong to give up on him.
It would have been a variant to bring another player, much better, but nothing came out.
"There have been several discussions, such as the one with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing has been done," Zaporojanou told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad at the beginning of this year.
Ilie Sarbu was voted vice-president at the Court of Auditors
Parliament's plenary voted on Wednesday to appoint PSD Senator Ilie Sarbu, the sister of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as Vice-President of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes were recorded "for" and 108 "for".
The vote was secret, with tickets.
PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, Digi24 reported.
On the other hand, the liberals criticised Sarbu's name in this function and announced that they would challenge the CCR, provided that he has a DNA file, but does not have the necessary preparation and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days to resign from the Senate, according to the law, because the new function of the Court of Auditors does not allow him to do politics anymore.
The PSD Senator will serve as Vice-President of the Court of Auditors' Audit Authority, a free branch after Ioan Anton was revoked, as a result of a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found that he was appointed non-constitutional.
Surprise from one of the hottest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper is going to play the role of a cook in the Burnt movie, the actor made a disappointment that his fans didn't expect.
In a recent interview, she said she grew up in the kitchen: "I worked a lot of my life as a cook."
It has failed to work in the kitchen for 15 years, when it worked for a Greek restaurant, so that then, in college, it continues the same way.
The actor explained that the mother had Italian origins, so the whole copy had finished with the Italian grandmother, related ContactMusic.
Asked what future plans he had in that period, Bradley Cooper said he was never the type of man to make plans for five years, "not even two".
"It's no reason for me to have a map," he said.
"I have dreams, things you'd love if I told you," he said, but he said that what he wanted from his co-worker was fulfilled.
At the age of 40, the actor acknowledged, however, that he was in the near future directing, taking Clint Eastwood's model, which was all the way to this age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational claims
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijarto condemned the statements of Prime Minister Victor Ponta on Wednesday morning according to Hungarian political decisions are "nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee".
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his irrational claims, insulted the whole of Hungary," the Hungarian Foreign Minister sent in a communiqué.
Civilised European politicians do not say such uncontrollable slander.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he lost his full support in Romania's internal policy," the Hungarian diplomat chief added, according to MTI.
In a post Tuesday evening on Facebook, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to attract attention and sanction the behavior of senior Hungarian government officials, who, in his opinion, "are a Russian for European Union culture and values".
I do not want to respond to the challenges that have come from a representative Hungarian government.
"This is a shame for the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and with regard to the treatment of minorities of all types, and now during the refugee crisis," Ponta said on Facebook.
The Roman Prime Minister added that it is the adoption of rational and sustainable solutions in the case of the refugee crisis, considering that brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Sarma gimpata, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, political decisions are better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which these refugees flee!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions, and more particularly in the superiority of European values - what we see in Hungary in the last days is totally contradictory to these objectives and values," stressed the chief executive of the novel.
Earlier Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijarto described the remarks of Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta about the management of Hungary's refugee crisis, considering that those statements were inappropriate for a 21st century leader, according to MTI.
The chief of Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned Tuesday as the "extreme and false marks" of the first Roman have been affected by the internal political crisis in Romania and stated that Budapest is waiting for excuses from the Roman side.
Szijarto referred to a statement made on Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I've said and said is that I'm always against xenophobic speeches the idea of closing the grenades, that all who come are terrorists, are the fools of the Middle Ages and I totally oppose this approach.
If we can get more, we'll get the problem, it's our logistics ability to treat those people as some people, not how they treat our neighbors, with the bat and the insemination.
"I don't agree with that," said the chief of the Roman executive, at a press conference in Targu-Juu.
Still Tuesday, Peter Szijarto announced that the government of Budapest decided to start preparations in the field for extending the border with Romania of the guard built on the border with Serbia to face any changes in the route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that Hungary's decision to raise a granite guard does not solve any of the refugee problems and "cut Hungary out of Europe".
What is the connection between Osama bin Laden and the cracking of the Mecca macara
The Saudi authorities have announced that the Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to the family of Osama bin Laden, is "partial responsible" for the collapse of a macara, Friday, on the Sea Mosque of Mecca, an accident following the carnage 107 people died.
According to a commission of inquiry, the company did not "respect the safety rules", reported the Saudi Press Agency (SPA), reports the BBC.
The company's directors were banned from leaving the country until the investigation was completed in this case.
The company will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of the former leader of the Al-Qaida terrorist network, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father after 80 years and is now led by the former terrorist leader's brother, Bakr.
Binladen Group has worked for 4 years at the extension of Mari Mosche to host more pilgrims.
The accident occurred on Friday night, during a storm, when a march, probably imbalanced by the strong wave reefs, collapsed on the eastern side of the cover of Maria Moschei de la Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How Hagi shut the contestants' mouth
Considered by many of the world's largest Roman footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labelled, after withdrawal from activity, as a weak coach, which cannot be able to perform perform and in the new position.
After an unfortunate experience on the national team, Steaua or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, after a year, the role of coach at the Future Constanta, the team that sponsors it.
After a year of team takeover, the King demonstrated that it is capable of transforming a team that was struggling to rescue from retrograde in a top.
Thus, after a year, the Future registered, with Hagi coach, 16 wins, 11 remates and 11 infringings.
The balance sheet is one of a top team, which fights European couples.
Things took a tournament and better for the future in this season, trained team got to place two in League 1, with 19 points, one less than Astra Giurgiu leader.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (equal to Astra), more than twice as much as Stara.
On the other hand, even if it brought more experienced players to the team, The Hague continued its policy of promoting young people, and in the last period, names such as Ianis The Hague or Hodorogea appeared.
The club's policy from the future has made a team of followers for foreign teams, so Hagi sold 1.5 million euros this summer - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
In addition to Steaua, the future is the only profitable team in League 1, according to data from the Commercial Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has played as a small country so far.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the EU's seventh country.
The big dates come with solutions for the EU as a whole, says Cristian Ginea, a member of the board of directors of the European Centre for Political Affairs.
In an interview given by Ziare.com, Cristian Ginea showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and the purely political means will not work in this crisis: "Perhaps we have doubts about the quality of the values that these people come with."
But there are masses that have started and we can't go back to history.
Migration is a reality that we need to adapt to as best as possible and adapt to us.
In the opinion of Christian Ginea, we find ourselves in an extremely emotional moment, where politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
Once it passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up their free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now an animal created at another time and has not been adapted to the situation at this time."
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JAI council that has actually solved nothing?
It is clear that the EC presidents in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to hold a vote in the Council.
All the predictions said they would have had the necessary votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the JAI shall apply the principle of unanimity and any State may block any decision.
That is why things have been very little integrated in the area of justice and internal affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure, in which the EC has the initiative, and the Council adopts a 55% vote among the states, namely 16, which represents 65% of the EU's population.
The calculations said the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go before.
Because it's a sensitive issue, there have been reactions to rejection even in Germany against the opening policy of Chancellor Merkel and they did not want in many countries to appear to be a reaction of the type 'EU sends migrants to our heads'.
They have now managed, but the problem remains because, obviously, this valley creates a huge problem for the Schengen government and we will probably attend major changes there in the next period.
So the mandatory quotas weren't really eliminated, but the subject was just allowed to cool off?
Yes, on the other hand, we are talking about a greater involvement of Frontex in the management of external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of the Schengen external border members to the responsibility of the Community agencies.
Greece's granite with Turkey is also Germany's granite with Turkey, in fact, and this wave of migrants has limited the old Schengen system.
Perhaps he will give up on the Dublin principle, according to the way migrants are responsible for the state in which they enter the first time, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece heads, you can't say at all that it's Greece's business.
Problem and common.
Just because the problem is common, is it possible to solve without a specific mechanism, perhaps even mandatory, to make the effort to receive it?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work, if it gets to them.
To remain a problem: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don't think European states are going to take up migrants: you're going to X or Y.
It is likely that it will reach some unique filtration centres, in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications will be processed.
They're working on solutions like that.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
There are countries that have ten years of experience in trying to integrate migrants, there are countries without any experience, such as Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the xenophob current.
It is true that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are in the Precise camp and who have just begun to go to Europe.
A estimate says that only 10% have been taken to leave, the winter is hard past the Mediterranean, but we expect next year to a wave perhaps even bigger.
What do we do with these people?
My prognosis is that we're going to get used to this problem, we're not going to look at it that way from a media point of view.
Talk to countries with a smaller or larger experience.
Does it seem to you that there is a place where the integration of large groups from an extra-European culture has really succeeded?
I look at the Maghrebs in France, the Turks in Germany, they're still trapped.
I wouldn't go to radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than in other migration values, but this does not mean that they are not integrated at all.
It remains an integral part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, the UK.
But the means of the police are not going to work.
To create strong Europe and illusion.
We must move towards integration mechanisms in European societies.
There were some mistakes here.
We have to be more pretentious.
Let us ask these people to learn the language, to try to take the values, to no longer stay on foot in Europe and with one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of the family, including through the convenience spouses.
However, the immediate problem of these people's long-term integration problems must be separated.
If others have been involved in long-term integration, it does not mean that we should look at them as they do in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with.
And if there's gonna be an intervention in Syria, what I don't think, doesn't mean that the country will recover overnight and you can take them back.
Before we have solutions, we see strengths within Europe.
They closed branches, raised walls, reintroduce controls at the border in the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as well as not, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was sufficiently minimal and setting the rules so that the pressure was too high on the days when they first set foot for these migrants.
I mean, we're running free from there, but everyone's in trouble.
In the face of such a wave, it can't be so, because some countries don't make the girl.
When such emotions exist, politicians want to show that they do something, but in the long term there is no big deal to change.
After the attacks in France, we don't have much more draconic anti-terrorist legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It's a wave of public emotion that's installed in both ways.
And it's so unstable from one week to the next that you can't make decisions on her basis.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of Belgian statements from politicians at home under the pressure of being men.
And then, you have a dramatic case of the ineged child in Turkey and the public opinion is excited.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the only real European market.
And I don't think Europeans will give up on this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules and something else.
Schengen is now like an animal created in a different era that was not adapted to the situation from now on.
How did Romania play so far in this crisis?
Like a little country that thinks, if she pulls the ball in her eye and it sucks her ears, the theme disappears.
In the face of the reality of migrants' waves, you can choose to be part of the solution or say that it's not your little country problem.
We have done this, it is a legitimate strategy, but after that you cannot ask to be treated as the EU's seventh country.
You're not, you're not playing big country.
The major tariffs come with solutions for the EU as a whole, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of the Roma for Schengen will decline very much.
President Johannis says it might be good that I haven't already entered.
So we move from despairing into a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
Of course, there is a risk that Romania and Bulgaria will enter Schengen to see us as an alternative route.
Which doesn't mean it's a reason we don't go into Schengen anymore, but we're more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that external borders will become common responsibility, will be the only rules for accepting migrants, the only rules for deportation for those who do not receive asylum, the only rules for the countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia shifted its attention to Syria in Ukraine, no one died.
Is there a link between the two focus, a game in Russia?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She believes that being a great power means invading Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a link.
Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, it is likely that Assad regime would have collapsed in a long time.
And it was good to dive before the main or opposition to be the Islamic State.
A couple of years have been a struggle between Assad and the secular and moderate Muslim armies, supported by the Gulf and the West.
Then the Islamic State rose and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia has been able to complicate things, but it cannot participate in the solution.
It creates a focus of instability and chaos that cannot close.
But you're a big power only if you have solutions.
The off-side game is just a strategy to win time.
Putin's probably waiting to make offers, press him on the buttons to solve the situation.
The offers do not come because the world is not convinced that he can solve in some way or other things created by him all.
But I don't agree with the theories that these people are being manipulated by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin stronger than he is.
What button will appear soon
Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the "Like" button, and now the representations of the socialization network are preparing the other opposite, the "Dislike".
Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on the account or that this button will be available soon, reports the New York Times on the blog.
Zuckerberg specified that the "Dislike" button will show a more serious announcement of what a user feels than a simple option.
However, the announcement or raised the problem that Facebook might become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wants to avoid the moments when someone puts on the account or an important event in life, and someone else will give "Dislike".
Network users, who have reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long asked to be able to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg said it's not very comfortable for people to give "Like" current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the case of a family member's death.
"You may not feel comfortable giving Like those posts," the Facebook representative said.
The variant of a new button on Facebook was not well received by everyone.
"There is already plenty of hate on Facebook and on socialization networks," said Atiq Haneef from Afghanistan, on the New York Times Facebook page, where an article was posted on this topic.
"I'm going to give 'Dislike' the 'Dislike' button," he specified.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist in Atlanta, argued that there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, the media analyst at eMarketer, mentioned that it is hard to imagine that a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
More than that, she supported it, approaching the election campaign in America, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary within 24 hours
Hungary only accepted 70 migrants, one hand of thousands of revenue at its southern border with Serbia, announced government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi on Tuesday.
Hungary declared an emergency during the day in two trials along the border with Serbia due to the flow of refugees, instituting a main border crossing point and announcing that it will build a guard at its border with Romania, DPA recalls.
Measure to delay or sudden reaction on the part of Serbia.
Just yesterday they said they'd seal the granite for those who want to pass, but not for those who want to cook asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," said Serbian refugee minister Aleksandar Vulin.
Before imposing the new immigration legislation, a record number of 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, the police announced Monday.
More than 170,000 immigrants from the Middle East and Africa also patrolled Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoided being registered and trying to reach the West, especially in Germany.
The "new" seat of the Jewish Council is drinking.
Two builders, in insolvency
The massive investments that have been made here in recent years for the purpose of changing the institution are due to the fact that they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who worked here went into insolvency during the work.
The seat of the Jewish Council from the street Vasile Alexander will be able to give himself up.
Within one and a half years of the completion of the building's consolidation and refurbishment work, the work did not reach even a half.
A final stage in the epoch of the building was consumed last day, when the National Contest Resolution Council (NCSC) rejected a complaint from the company that wanted to take the contract to carry out the technical project for the work that is still to be done.
The original project was built by Impex Romcatel SA.
Following the insolvency of the builder and termination of the works, the negotiation procedures were launched without the publication of a notice of participation with Impex Romcatel, the company was to update the technical project and then organise a new tender for works.
"The negotiations did not end, however, through a contract, with CJ appreciating that the proposed form would be disadvantaged by the institution," said Rázvan Timofciuc, representing public relations within the CJ.
The CJ decision to terminate direct negotiations was appealed against by Impex Romcatel.
The Court of First Instance sent a complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it as a delay.
This does not mean, however, that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to attack CNSC's decision to the Court of Appeal, just after a final sense of it being able to take into account the finding of another designer.
Thus, building consolidation work could be resumed earlier in the next year.
Our intention is to resume the work as soon as possible.
In principle, the refurbishment of the technical project should not last long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We expect to see whether the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," Timofciuc said.
The work to consolidate the former police station began in 2011.
A first contract of work was concluded in April 2012, after works of 4.5 million lei.
The tender was resumed, the contract being awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the company entered into insolvency, and this contract was terminated after payment of 1.5 million lei.
The work has so far been carried out in proportion to about 50%.
Initially, the work of consolidation, refurbishment and management of the building was assessed at 7.7 million lei.
"Stop, I say it all!" - a statement that could incriminate the former head of the Cadastral
One of the employees involved in the scandal file from the Cadastral Office signed an agreement to recognise the facts, against imprisonment with delay.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate others accused, face to face with former chief, Narciza Nedelcu
A consultant from the Cadastral and Real Estate Advertising Office (OCPI) was accused of DNA in a corruption file and admitted to television.
The agreement on recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dascalu was registered yesterday at the Iaşi Court, and the judges decided to provide a solution in this case on 29 September.
Dimitru Daniel Dascalu was accused of being a continuous false intellectual and agreed to run two years in chisso with delay, as well as work for the benefit of the community.
As regards Dascalu's alleged actions, the prosecutors stated that he, as a member of the Cadastral Office, together with other colleagues, "has entered into false multiple verbal acceptance processes, seeking to sell the service contracts in the key before by O.C.P.I. I. Iahi with the managers of SC Gauss SRL, SC Group Cinci SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC Cad Dastru Agency and Topography SRL and PFA Lipşa Stefan, which falsely certified that the services contracts had been carried out in full, under the conditions in which they had not been carried out and were not deposited at O.C.P.I.I.Iaş".
Last day, former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but also other former or current employees of the OCPI were sent to court in this file, the charges being the decommissioning of services to the companies mentioned, although the works were not carried out.
Before the trial, it's over 300,000 lei.
Adventures in Stone Age
In the opinion of the president of FRH, Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the national women's handball to qualify for the Olympics costs a fortune.
The president of the Romanian Handball Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday, during a press meeting, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the League of Champions groups.
With regard to Romania's national women's handball team, "the main goal is to qualify for the Rio Olympics, but for this it has to go through two stages of caudious theft, firstly the World Championship and secondly the pre-qualification tournament," Dedu said.
We really want to qualify for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staff to be composed of seven or eight persons.
He wants second coach, doctor, two massages, carrier coach, physical trainer, head of delegation.
They asked us to qualify for some things, more precisely material for physical preparation, which we've never heard of.
All this to get to the Olympic Games. And I'll do everything I have to have them.
We're talking about a massive investment, it's a lot, a lot of money.
But this is the way to make performance.
Because at the moment we're at the time of the stone preparation.
"The teams with which we are fighting have these materials and have them for some time," said Dedu, who mentioned that he is trying to obtain the necessary amounts for the purchase of these products from MTS and COSR.
The president of FRH also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility of our country hosting a major handball competition.
We don't have a room in Bucharest.
It is a problem of infrastructure and it is shameful to have a European Gymnastic Championship under the sign of the question.
Let's not forget that in other parts of the world the entire Olympic neighborhood has been built over a period of two years.
Before 1992, in the current Barcelona Olympic area, there was a pile of trash, and now there is a beautiful repertoire.
It also happened in London, where the 2012 Olympics were a success and in terms of investment.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition," Dedu said.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organisation of a major competition.
For me, it is a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Gațu went civilized with a project, people gave their agreement in principle, but they soon realized that the hall would never be built.
And I had discussions with the EHF, I told them that we want, that we are able to organize and they said that I agree and invite them to the first match in the new room in Bucharest and then we discuss concrete.
"So we have all the opening, both at the EHF and at the IHF, but we have no infrastructure," official FRH explained.
The former great handballist avoided evaluating the chances of women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach Final Four: "I have asked all coaches to be reserved in forecasts, that if they don't comply with them, they will return."
Good way to the World Cup
Romanian Rugbis Starts on 23 September, against France
The captain of the national rugby team Mihai Macovei said, on Tuesday, in a press conference, that all members of the Romanian lot are ready for World Cup matches in England, where he hopes to win two victories: "We are ready".
Both me and my colleagues are with the motors at the maximum speed.
We've been trained to give the best shot in the four matches.
Everyone will have great expectations, because our goal is to win in two matches, against Canada and Italy.
All the groups are hard and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first time with France and then we'll see.
But of course, if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I can't describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, is the announcement of so many years of work.
I wish I didn't disappoint any of the rugby's family and come with nice results at home.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like the rugby in Romania, are proud of the tricolor," Macovei said.
Romania's national team selector Lynn Howels, who was the first coach at the World Cup, hopes to make Romanians proud of the rugby's selection: "It's a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup".
I'm sure the players are ready to take part in the tournament.
It's an extraordinary experience for me.
For me, it is very important for every game to make Romanians proud of the national team.
The President of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitrasz, trusts that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in the last years in Rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made on the national team.
I want the athletes to succeed and I'm convinced that we'll be at the top of the event.
"These guys started to play in Romanian teams at 18-19 years old, so there is cohesion, there is a band of friends, who set out to make a dream," Dumitras said.
At the World Cup of rugby in England, Romania will evolve into Group D, with the following matches: with France, on 23 September in London; with Ireland, on 27 September in London; with Canada, on 6 October in Leicester; with Italy, on 11 October in Exeter.
The competition starts on Friday, at the Twickenham Stadium in London, with the England - Fiji match in Group A.
New Japanese culture courses organized at the University of "Al.I. Cuza"
About the arrangement of flowers in a vase, painting in the shower, but also a leisure study about the beautiful specific arts of the Sun Country you can learn at the courses organized by the students who have gone out.
The Japanese Culture Students in Iaşi circle organizes new Japanese culture courses (ikebana, sumie and beautiful art) in the period October 2015 - June 2016, courses for both beginners and people who are notified.
They will take place at the European Studies Centre of Al. I. Cuza University of Iaşi and are organized to promote Japanese, traditional and modern arts and culture.
For these, there is only one fee of 50 lei per month.
Apart from art lessons, participants will be able to participate in exhibitions and other cultural activities to promote beauty.
The Japanese culture courses we have proposed were designed as an invitation to the general public to take the first steps on the road to self-knowledge through art.

14 million lei give to St. Spiriton Hospital in Iaşi at budget correction
What will be bought with this important amount of money?
The hospital "St. Spiriton" received about 14 million lei from the Ministry of Health, following budgetary correction.
The money received by the medical unit to be used by the end of the year will be invested in the modernisation and modification of clinics, but also in medical equipment and equipment for which the hospital has already begun the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the health unit will be equipped with a new tomograph computer, with a new radiology apparatus, with six tricks used for surgical interventions, six ATI beds equipped with appropriate ophthalmogenic microscopy and other equipment necessary for the performance of the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei of the money received from the hospital will be directed to the construction and repair work of the "Marelius Ars".
Out of the budget correction money, UPU will receive 500,000 lei for the completion of the modernisation work in the main throne.
"In addition, the following days we will receive work from the gateway that links UPU to cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure transport in decent conditions of the UPU patient in neighbouring clinics," the medical unit manager explained.

The drop, made of RATP controllers and a flyer.
The presence of a tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iaş to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After my life experience, neither I nor my wife will ever want to walk in your city again.
Without a wish, misinformation was struck out of the folds, the lack of RAPT controllers and, bonus, an amendment "as the law says".
The husbands arrived in Iaşi a few days ago, settled in a hotel in the Centre and asked for tourist supplies.
They also received an envelope where the RATP routes had passed.
"Darmatize" with these maps, the husbands have visited the Iaş.
But two days ago, you were in Copou, they wanted to get to the Mall Palace.
Because it was not toned with tickets at the station next to the Copou Park, they were based on the information printed on the canvas: that I can take the ticket via SMS.
No one told them this service doesn't exist anymore.
Trustees in the canvas, they entered a bus and tried to send SMS after the instructions on the canvas.
Unfortunately for them, it made its appearance a team of RATP controllers.
They said there's no longer a 2-year-old service and that he announced in the press that he's cancelled.
IF YOU KNOW what was written in the local press, I'll come one night before I visit the city?
We talked to the controllers, we explained the situation, they said they didn't care, it's not their business.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said that all I can do is give us one amendment instead of two (my and my wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to spend my visiting stand day on January and give the statements there," says Ovidiu.
In conclusion, the family was amended because of misinformation on the screen and the controllers who "applyed the law on blood".
It's not right, and I made a session at the RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about money, I'm not exaggerated by a lot, but the idea is that I felt bad.
Ghinion for Vaslui rapists.
They had an accident and remained in preventive arrest
The process of the seven Violators from Vaslui moved yesterday to the Court of Appeal.
The judges have tried the first term of trial in an unpublic sitting where the seven young people accused of beating an 18-year-old asked to be released.
Before the opening of the trial session, one of the judges who had been assigned the file, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for detention, which was accepted by his colleagues from the court.
The judge activated until the summer of this year at the Vaslui Court, where he was president of the Section on the ground, he was the one who, on 9 April, admitted a complaint made by four of the accused, having their arrest at home.
Currently, the file is judged by a complete of which are part of the Magistrates Maricica Mititlu and Geta Sandu.
Previously, in the file, Judge Dan An Ton made a reservation, on the ground that his daughter is in a conjugal relationship with one of the offenders' lawyers.
The two judges decided that Vaslui's violators would continue to remain in preventive arrest.
Those blacks will remain in prison for at least 30 more days, when Jews who will redeem the possibility of their release.
The next term of office will be held at the Court of Appeal on 6 October.
Before reaching the Court of Appeal Iaşi, the doubt with which the Violators were transported from Vaslui was involved in an accident produced in the neighborhood of Păcurari, the car entering Iaşi in the centre.
The Iveco driver who was transported by the seven rapists hit a Volks wagon bus that came out of Canta Street, and the driver tried to turn left.
The duba runs through the end of Easter.
The car entered Iaşi here because the employees of the Prison Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Iaşi to Graduri, then on the bus stop.
They took the road a few miles.
Immediately after the impact, the escort of the detainees called for another transport to take over.
In a short time, at the site of the accident, a car was sent from the Penitentiary of Maximum Security Iaşi, who seized the seven detainees and transferred them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the arrests were injured.
To transfer them to the other dock, the guards surrounded the back of the niels, and the arrests came out in a hurry, two or two.
"The incident has not been reported to the police, because drivers of cars have been able to understand the damage they have to pay," said Chief Medálin Čăranu, in the IPJ.
Great migration
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what it will follow.
What about Europe?
I say it from the outset, clearly and clearly: the 7000 refugees that Romania should and must naturalise are, in itself, a small number, but huge compared to the ability of the Romanian State to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1500 souls, is far beyond our good solidarity intentions with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Of course, if those migrants will even agree to settle in our localities, the chances of quickly integrating them into Romanian society are extremely small.
I'm sure they'll be the first to lose their patience.
Parasite of interlocutors and paralysed by a venal political class, the Romanian state is proving powerless in all areas.
The inability to integrate cigarettes is just a banal example.
In addition, governments of all colors have been unable to absorb European funds, make roads, gardens or modern schools, provide decent medical care, tighten the misery on the street, create decent paid jobs or keep their own young generation home.
Why would refugees be established in another country he's fleeing from?
But what makes a lot of wonder is, in particular, the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is dealt with.
First of all, we are struck by the vicious hypocrisy of the EU's powerful states, which are proving to be most generous when it comes to sharing the troubles with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearsome hypocrisy of the Romans who, although they have millions of rubies scattered around the world, do not yet accept the other - another language, another religion, another blood.
He's probably afraid of stealing any of the national beings.
Subsequently, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although only calling for war's horrors as a reason for their departure, do not accept a destination of exodus other than Germany or the Nordic countries.
But not all refugees are Syrians, and there is no war in Pakistan.
Also, the simple way in which the crisis is analyzed can only be taken away.
Causes must be eliminated, supported by some, and strictly based on the book of political correctness, demand for peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and even more, from time to time, some foreign capital in the national economy - but this does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country each year.
Why is he leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has proved to us to be an anchored, decombined and overstated building.
I was deploreing the fact that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but that the EU does not have a future plan.
And improvisation and threats don't help anything.
Then, what more benefit does the EU have if the only advantage the Romanians enjoyed - the right to freedom of movement - could be discussed due to the waves of refugees crossing the border as through cheese?
At a certain point, the war in Syria will end.
Not the crisis of migrants, though.
Over the next few decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource exhaustion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia, and especially from Africa, to a better life.
As such, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what it will follow.

EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At 20 years of age, she received a brave gift: biological parents
Lost in a hospital in the dark of the '90s, when he had only two months of life, small, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a family established in Italy, in the same years when adoption was vaguely regulated, a young woman coming out, now a blonde and beautiful girl, met others in Iasai with biological parents from a village of the Jews, after almost two decades in which no one knew anything about others.
The crina will fulfill these 20 years, and her adoptive parents in Palermo thought to offer their beloved daughter a delightful and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, Iaşi, to get to know her unclear past.
"The newspaper of Iaşi", which attended the efforts to search the family of origin after a few extremely vague indications, was witness to these meetings that virtually broke your heart.
Reporting of reporters, moments' emotions, statements of those involved, their reactions are moving and compulsive.
Crine's story began 20 years ago in Ruginosa's outing town, when he was only two months old.
Then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the city.
At home there were misunderstandings between parents, and Mother was forced to leave home.
He decided to keep the girl and send me home.
He stopped the girl, and since then I've known nothing.
"When I found out that she was in the hospital, it was too late," recalls grieved Alina, the girl's biological mother.
Crina was hospitalized with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in Pascani, and still the girl's father, Costa Rica Balkan, went to work in Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives were to be definitively divided.
They haven't found Crina in the hospital yet.
After boarding, Crine's father went to work elsewhere, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iaşi, and the father, when he came back, never found her again.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"You'd think she'd been abandoned," she tells a cousin of the family.
Because of the financial problems, Grandma couldn't come with Crina to Iaşi, and the girl remained in the care of the doctors.
Because no one was interested in the fate of the child all the time, it was taken over by the General Directorate of Social Welfare and the Protection of the Child Iasi, who then gave it to the care of the Plasement Centre in Bucium.
It was years in which abandonment and adoption were further regulated against today in Romania.
At the Bucium Centre was found by the Italian Salvadorian and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but did not succeed.
They fell in love instead of the Crina blonde, and after some time it was supposed to move definitively with them in Italy.
The small has already been in place for nearly two years, while the adoption formalities have lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt she was our girl.
"As if my wife had given her life," smiles Salvadore, the adoptive father, as he grabs the girl's fiancee palm.
In the country, the parents of Crine, Alina and Costa, continued separate searches, each where they could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginosa, but he didn't get any answer where his child might be.
The police then told him it's possible to be dead, but the parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told me she was gone to Italy, to Palermo.
And the conditions for looking for her were gone.
We prayed to God to be okay.
I've been thinking about her all the years that have passed, but there's been no way we could walk, find her.
"It's hard," she tells us with tears in the eyes of the organic mother of Crine.
But even though years have passed, parents in Ruginosa have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and her wife explained to the girls where she came from and that her past was a link to Romania.
I was little when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my parents in Romania," Crina confesses with joy.
And her dream was going to come true.
In March of this year, Commissioner Ichim, Director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Drug Advisor Iași, was contacted by a knowledge from Italy, who explained Salvador's desire to find the biological family of Chile.
And the search only started with a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started our first departures.
We only got a name, the Costa Rican Balkans, then the locality, Ruginosa.
In a short time I had an activity with the primacy there, and I could ask if there was a locality the name given.
Then they gave me a few clues, just that the person found wasn't the one they were looking for.
"It took about a month to find the girl's biological father," explains chief Romanca Ichim.
In total, better than three months, they took the authorities to find Costa and Alina, especially if everyone had their own place elsewhere.
We began our journeys somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
"Then we decided that a first meeting would take place in September," Romance Ichim added.
In the weekend that passed, Alina and Costa saw for the first time the girl lost on the halls of the hospital in Iaşi, 20 years ago.
Father, excitedly, could hardly have mastered his tears, and his hands kept trembling.
He barely changed a few words with the people around him.
A week before the meeting, she couldn't sleep much anymore.
He was still excited, trembling.
"To see your child after so many years, it's something," a nephew tells us, and she comes with Costica de la Ruginosa.
Meeting of the Crina with Mom and the biological brother
In his talks with his daughter, who is going to study at a well-listed university in Italy, Costa Rica Balkan told him, among other things, that if he ever wanted to return to him, in the village, he would come quietly: he could give him something sheep, goats, to find a boy from the village and to build a household.
Mom is also excited, crying, and hard to believe that such a thing can happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think that could happen.
I've seen cases like this on TV, I've been thinking about these years, I've hoped, but I didn't think I could be like that.
They're very big emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope we visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep a bond," she tells us with great tears on the faces of Alina, the mother of Crine, while holding a maid in her hand.
He's still hiding his tears, fortunately, because in a short time he'll see her face after so bitter a time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will be fulfilling in just a few days, this month, 20 years, tries to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she had a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they're young, but now before the meeting he's trying to get his thoughts together, because he's got a lot to say, but nothing to say.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are the ones who raised me.
It'll be a nice meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope I have a nice memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," Krina confesses.
First family meeting in Iaşi
In the Union Square, under the sky of early autumn, the family of Ruginoasa reunites its destiny with their daughter of Palermo.
Crina is 20 years old now, finishing high school, according to the Italian school model, but she can start a new chapter with Alina and Costa, her biological parents.
I don't divide borders or countries anymore, but only one barrier: the language.
Which, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the center of Iaş, passed easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say it's the first event of this kind done, and that in the future, if there's a chance, they'll do it again.
It's the first event of this sort of organized, such an emotional charge, and I'm glad to be a success.
We, at the Centre, have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that deals only with consumers, drug dependents.
But we're trying to save societies something good back.
"If I am still asked for such an event, I will do it very kindly," says Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Drug Advisor Iași.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, withdraws the storytelling.
I understand: there's a lot to say to each other.
Armistice with guns at the foot, yesterday, at the PSD.
Everybody shoots their soul
The boards of the PSD's exit branch have closed a gun-armed armistice.
After successive rounds of discussions, carried by Friday to Sunday, the first being and the most tense, the PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend the hostilities.
The executive presidents of the Party, Liviu Dragnea, are asked to present a united position, and the outgoing Social Democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates to the Party's functions.
Apart from being finished, the party's internal war seems to have only taken a break to allow fighters to shoot their souls.
Dragnea didn't give an ultimatum.
He has launched a very simple and very current message under the conditions of now: try to find a solution not to endanger the party.
On October 3, we have a party election.
All functions will be made available to those who wish them.
"By then, we remain in the existing structure," said interim Prime Minister Mihai Chirica.
The two days of the weekend talks just led to the conclusion that nothing was certain.
At the October elections, there is an acute competition for the function of the President of the Jewish branch of the PSD.
On the short list of potential candidates to the main function of the party's exit branch is the State Secretary Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazer, Jewish Councillor Vasile Câtea and interim President of the Jewish Council, Victorel Lupu.
They could also be added to the mayor of the municipality of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
A variant taken into account is also the candidacy of the leader of the Jewish councillors of the PSD, Cristian Stanciu, where Lupu will no longer register, sources from the party claiming that it is not interested in function.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in the last few days is the former branch leader, Prime Minister Gheorghe Nisita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, even on the day of the elections, candidates may be filed, and they would not look at anyone if it happened.
"The important thing is that we remain united, and we will remain also after 3 October, when we have a new Executive Bureau, a new Permanent Jewish Bureau and all new leadership structures," Câtea said.
Until internal elections are organised, the leadership of the Jewish PSD branch will be provided by Victorel Lupu, a close to Nisita and Stanciu.
Lupu, however, is on leave until 29 September, preparing the elections in practice to be provided by the executive secretary of the branch, Jewish councillor Mihail Popescu, in relations with the Nisita camp.
Phone contact, Cristian Stanciu has appreciated the discussions over the last few days as leading to "partial consensus".
There is a wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus was reached in order to support a unitary team to deal with the case.
"There are, on the other hand, several variations on the intentions of the PSD presidential nomination Iaşi, the list remaining open," said Stanciu.
An emissary judge rejected the case of the Violators in Vaslui on the grounds of concubinaj
The seven young people in Vaslui's trial sentenced for rape are arriving today at the Court of Appeal.
The Vasluans sentenced to five years and eight months and eight months and four months will present their arguments on their release, after the founding court, Vaslui, established their imprisonment immediately after the sentence was pronounced.
The file was registered at the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, Judge Dan Anton making a request for detention, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton appealed that one of the accused's lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is his daughter's concubine, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, the one who received the greatest punishment in this file.
How Judges Motivated Sentence
At the end of last week, the judge at Vaslui's trial, who sentenced the seven young people, motivated the feeling.
The judge is, therefore, talking about the challenging reaction of the accused, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation in the public opinion.
"The Court finds that after the imposition of the preventive measure of judicial control, a restrictive measure of freedom but not a private one, under the influence of the accused's attitude, families and local supporters, a strong feeling of indignation at the level of the local and national community was felt at the level of the local community as to the fact that persons accused of serious acts are judged under a less restrictive measure," the Vaslui Judge argues.
The magistrates have also removed the main defense of the seven accused who in the course of the trial have invoked the fact that the girl they raped would not be "the church's door".
"The Court underlines that there is a lack of relevance to the moral quality of the injured person, the aspect which the accused wanted to highlight through the defences they formulated, since the physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be violated under any pretext," it further stated in the explanatory statement.
Corbyn, Brexit and Europe's future
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the past ten years cannot continue the same in the next few years.
By Saturday, the world probably knew little in Romania who Jeremy Corbyn was.
Even today, after he has become the new leader of the British Labour Party, many wonder how we can be affected by the choice of a politician who, in turn, is not in a position of decision.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical left-wing leader of the labs since the war.
Marxist declared, anti-monarist (at a time given to Tony Blair, then Prime Minister, to expel the royal family from Buckingam Palace), a fierce anti-American and a fellow of Vladimir Putin (it was otherwise regularly invited to comment on political events by the television channel "Russia Today") and the terrorist movements Hizbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to give up nuclear weapons and leave NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at the time considered the killing of Osama bin Laden as a real tragedy, ISIS is almost preferred by the United States.
After the model of all populist demagogies, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things about the kind of people he was saying and promising them and Tsipras in Greece until he got in touch with the real world and economic legitimacy.
The economic programme of the new Labour Leader provides for, among other things, massive renationalisation and money printing as a solution to the financing of development projects and the coverage of very generous social benefits.
Of course, some might wonder why the solution to the printing of money is not unanimously adopted on the world, I then had a global prosperity! but who else to prevent such details.
Of course, we can charge blood to the bankers, become a kind of left-handed enemy, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in former Communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of Mitterand's and Holland's mandates.
The additional amounts are quickly consumed by generous promises, without covering, made by populist demagogies.
As Margaret Thatcher drew attention, "the problem of socialism is that at a given time the money of others ends."
Few people give Jeremy Corbyn real chances of ever reaching prime minister.
At the beginning of the 1980s another radical left leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in conviction as the party's leader's freshly elected failure.
And then there is still a working class in Britain, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were more influential than they are now.
Under the conditions of the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant in the whole of the labour force, and extensive automations have made it necessary in industry to be highly skilled, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
However, even in opposition, he can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In its last number, the Financial Times considers Corbyn's election to increase Brexit's chances, namely the release of the UK from the EU.
The new Labourist leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership in the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that has led to the austerity of the poor.
When you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with rhetorical anti-immigration and you look at the crisis of refugees who are emerging from the EU's foundations to an explosive mix.
And not just for the Great Britain.
However, if the British decide after the referendum, which is to take place by 2017, to leave the Union the loss of symbolic capital for the whole European project and the deep gaps created within this Euro crisis and now the refugees, between the North and the South, between the East and the West, leave room for the most worrying scenarios.
As much as for a whole series of Member States, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (in which however Berlin becomes increasingly the dominant actor).
It is true, the British business environment, the City, are strong lawyers of the remaining country in the EU.
But today's Europe is no longer the one in the past.
There are many resentments, which grow in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, I have just recently had a sample in Jean Claude Junker's speech, tends to make more and more major decisions over the heads of the large majority of Member States by consulting only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And this happens under conditions where electoral support for anti-system formations, anti-immigration that are at the same time and Eurosceptic is growing spectacularly across the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with negative loads has reached higher rates than ever before.
Where and how does the Financial Times draw it when it evaluates Brexit's chances?
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that goes from national interest.
If voters make the brain decision, then the UK will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as is expected, we will attend a more pronounced integration of the euro area, which will push most of the countries in the region and the peripherality of interest and the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feed on popular rhetoric from the frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed over the past ten years, the generous social benefits, cannot continue the same in the next few years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-immigration zone, both of the relevant decisions that have taken into account only the integrationist political ambitions, not the ability and availability of peoples and governments in Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and may affect Romania's greater situation.
And it's hard to exclude something from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our leading political leaders are capable of dealing with such complicated situations.
Constantine Brancuşi, the god of the country.
Rockefeller, "How can I help you?"
Brancushi: "Take and measure the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to be famous, to hear about him all over the world.
Behind his reputation, however, there is something almost forgotten today, when millions of successful stories have been delivered to us, reserved for success in life.
That thing has a name.
It's called "everything."
What about Constantine Brancusi?
What else is it to say, actually?
His image appeared on the banknote.
And recently, a famous bank in Romania hired an actor to play it in an advertising moment.
Brancusi has been producing and delivering money for nearly 60 years since he's not among us anymore.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and bubbles that bear his name.
Otherwise, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he comes out with the grown-up, he hears the following instructions: "We're going to the park, to the Brancushi."
The land is divided by its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known by so many people, from children, to the elderly.
Brancuşi's infiltration capacity is a huge one.
Communists have not been able to remove it from Romania's memory and culture.
His stories start today the internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of ligaments and shares.
And then again, what else would it be to say, to write about this man?
Looking at the pile of books and articles that are trying to rebuild his destiny, Brancuşi's life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
You know, it's those people who tell you that if you didn't have the chance to be born in a big city and in a family as well as you've got, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
Brancuşi's life is the perfect example.
And maybe there would be a key here.
Maybe from here we should start the text that follows.
With a sense, as hateful as they are.
Look at the success stories that are delivered to you every day in newspapers and on TV.
Look carefully at this man's figure.
Do you want to know how to succeed in life, how, today, he heard a whole map of it?
It's simple.
He worked his whole life to be somebody.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brancuşi was born on 19 February 1876 in Hobita, a small village in the municipality of Peșişani, the county of Goj, on the banks of the Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brancuşi.
Although he came from a family of settled countrymen, Brancuşi led a modest life, but one of them had to collect his beads that would guide his late artistic vision.
Remembering the childhood and the places he grew up, the artist had to witness, in a meeting with Petre Çuţea, from Paris, from 1933: "By then life was beautiful and harmonious."
For thousands of years, people have been leading, happy, a patriarchal life.
Everything was quiet from one time to another.
And you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the great city has reached us.
Brancusi's childhood was, however, far from an idyllic one.
One of the moments spent in these early years of life is extremely suggestive of the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor of the years spent in the natural place.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brancuşi. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantine Brancusi was 3 years old.
In the fall of that year, when the cottage was made, following those who tasted the liquid to see if the process was going on properly, Brancuşi caught a moment of general negligence.
It fills its palmhouse with garlic and drinks on unsweetened.
He's falling asleep almost instantly.
The first people barely notice in a few minutes.
Mom panics, then she gets married, thinking her son died.
By night, when the father, Radu, returns from life accompanied by praise, he sees from afar the desperate signs of those waiting for him with his soul at his mouth.
The party is immediately turned into a cave.
The father is already thinking about burying.
However, someone finds that it's good to call Baba Branduşa, doftoroai and Brancuşi's servants.
Brandusa checks the child's breathing, then puts it under the nose of the horse, gathered nearby.
The poor, strong child.
The world applauds.
While the boy is allowed to sleep further away from the bet, with joy, the party with constant praise and more strength.
The next day, the father and son meet through the meadow.
Radu Brancuşi puts Constantin to gather some clouds and bring them.
The father puts his child in his head and, with the clouds brought to the boy, beats him to keep him in mind.
And while he feels the shock of the hits, little Brancuşi has the revelation that the world can be seen from a different perspective and that things around him can appear rebellious.
Especially the position of the sun, unlike the well-known one, makes him wonder, as if he was to recognize old age, if the star himself does not participate in his disorder.
May the sun be as troubled as his father as what happened to him?
At the current time, the city does not work
A parliamentary appeals to politicians to remember those who voted for them.
Independent MP Viorel Blăjuţ called on the PSD and PNL to stop the internal battles and reorient the agenda to the election.
What we see now on our political scene is a great disunity and so on.
I haven't seen any of the USL projects since 2012 to continue.
No highway, no Regional Emergency Hospital, you see just how politicians are dealing with possible locations based on real estate interests.
Let's leave the politics a little further, gather and talk.
At the current time, the city doesn't work.
"If you're busy with the internal war, you don't have time for those who chose you," Blajut said.
He appreciated that the current political class decomposed the outgoing electorate, the consequence of being a very low presence in the future local elections, around 30%, representing practically the faithful electorate of the parties.
The Member also believes that voters will all be directed towards traditional parties, expressing their reservations to new political initiatives, as is the "Pentru Iaşi" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very little chances and will only break out of the right election, not the PSD.
Such parties are based on civilian active people, who are usually right.
"It is also more right-handed, which is not good for anyone, nor for PSD," Blajut said.
He stated that he was not interested in a candidate in the future local elections, discontinuing the rumors about his intention to join the Primate race.
I said I don't want to run for any local function.
I wonder if you will continue to be a Member in the future.
I tried to appeal to the Iaşi unit and in the talks on the halls, with other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to make an image of myself.
I don't want to, but we can't keep going like this.
"If people voted for us, it doesn't mean they're stupid to vote for us if I don't see anything," Blajut said, who appreciated that the main reason why the election is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the electorate.
A colleague from Tatarasi said they don't get the money and have to go on the bus.
Let's not be hypocrites.
There's not a little money.
Sometimes I'm ashamed to raise the money from the casino.
At the end of the term, I will make a report on all that I have spent, except for the salaries of the employees from the office and their maintenance.
It happened to rise in a month and 30,000 lei, with all transport, accommodation and other accounts.
"Let's say a parliamentarian doesn't get his money is pure hypocrisy," Blajut concluded.
