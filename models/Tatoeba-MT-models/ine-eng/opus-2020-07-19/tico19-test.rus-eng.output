The rapidly increasing rate of cumulative coronary infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and in Britain between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
The cumulative incidence of coronary infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and in the United Kingdom, thus confirming that despite the various stages of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive therapy offices, it is necessary to increase the level of preparedness for the flow of patients with COVID-19 who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive therapy.
On 31 December 2019, several cases of Pneumonia disease of unknown etiology were recorded in Uhan Hubei Province of China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a new type of coronal virus, currently known as a type 2 severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-COV-2), was a source of infection.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been called a coronary infection (COVID-19).
According to data available to date, approximately 80 per cent of people with COVID-19 have mildly developed respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia, with most of the patients being cured.
Approximately 14 per cent of the COVID-19 cases are developing a more severe form of hospitalization, while the remaining 6 per cent take a critical form when intensive therapy is required.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4 per cent.
The study analyzes and compares the cumulative disease trends of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) and in the United Kingdom.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom with data on Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom
After the outbreak in China, the COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and the rest of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing according to the same dynamics as in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance issue of 5 March 2020, Mr. Spiterie (Spiteri) and his colleagues reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 disease in Europe that met the WHO criteria for disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were registered in France on 24 January 2020, all three of whom returned from the Hubay Province of China.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of infection with COVID-19 have been identified in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, with 39 768 cases of infection and 1,727, of which 17,750 cases, including 1,441 fatalities, have been reported to Italy alone.
Determination of cumulative amount and cumulative disease COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) daily updates data on the number of recorded cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of those countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
This data is used to analyse the trends in the prevalence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom and in comparison with data on Italy.
The COVID-19 cumulative disease was estimated as a 14-day prevalence rate, taking into account the conventional flow of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in Britain between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
We also presented a cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8:00, 15 March 2020, compared to data on Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in the development of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
Trends in the development of COVID-19 in the 14-day period in EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom generally corresponded to the trends observed in the Chinese province of Hubei (Figure 1).
The cumulative COVID-19 disease in the EU/EEA and in the United Kingdom generally began to grow about 21 February, and on 28 February 2020 there was a sharp rise in this rate (additional material).
This was mainly due to a rapid increase in the number of registered cases of disease in Italy, but similar trends were observed in all other EU/EEA countries and in Britain to increase the cumulative disease of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom as compared with a similar figure for Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already registered as at 8:00 p.m. in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom is comparable to the number recorded in Italy about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 recorded cases in the EU/EEA and in Britain.
The observed cumulative disease trends of COVID-19 suggest that pandemics develop at comparable rates in all countries.
This is despite different stages in different countries, differences in response measures taken by national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for the recognition of disease cases and different rules for the selection of patients for the analysis of the availability of COVID-19, including “declaring” testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10 per cent of patients with COVID-19 require intensive therapy, and media noted that hospitals and intensive care facilities in these regions have already been fully filled.
Currently, data on the incidence of COVID-19 patients in the hospital and/or intensive treatment offices in the EU/EEA are available only for 6 per cent and 1 per cent of cases, respectively (data not provided).
However, a systematic collection of such data is needed to supplement current monitoring data, the number of recorded cases and the number of deaths.
According to the 2010-2011 study, there was a significant drop in the number of cats in intensive care and care offices in Europe: from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive therapy and intensive care facilities for 100,000 people in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated ECDC report on the results of the COVID-19 risk assessment presents scenarios for the charging of health systems with estimated hospitalization data for COVID-19 infected in each EU/EEA country and in Britain, where the risk of lack of available cocaine in intensive therapy offices exceeds 90 per cent.
As the cases are currently grouped into certain EU/EEA regions and Britain, and hospitals and intensive care offices are usually serving the population of a particular territorial group, information on the cases of infection and the number of cats in intensive care offices is recommended, if possible, to provide territorial unit denominations for statistical purposes (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly in the EU/EEA and Britain.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care facilities should therefore be prepared for the SARS-CoV-2, a long-term non-depleting contact infection scenario, and for the growth of patients with COVID-19 in need of medical care, and, in particular, intensive therapy, which can be observed in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the latest ECDC report on risk-expression results, the importance of preventing the spread of SARS-COV-2 is an operational, preventive and integrated approach with a subsequent shift from mitigation to minimisation, since, given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases affecting persons and hospitals, it may simply not be time to consider, adopt and adjust their response accordingly, unless such measures are taken in advance.
The report on the results of the risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time during which they can intensify their control efforts to slow the distribution of SARS-COV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If not, in the next few days or weeks of the health system in other EU/EEA countries, patients who will need intensive therapy will be confronted with flood.
The outbreak of coronary virus infection 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) of type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a tragedy for mankind: more than 3,000 people have died in China and other countries of the world, and more than 80,000 have been infected.
Like the homological SARS-CoV virus, which caused the development of a severe severe respiratory syndrome in thousands in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from flying mice and caused similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 differs from the lower severity of the disease and lower mortality than SARS, but it is much more infected and affects older people more often than young people, and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, the article proposes an up-to-date and comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving subject of the study.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnostics, treatment, forecasting further flow and prevention of the disease.
While the answers to many questions are still to be found, we hope that this review will help to understand and eliminate the dangerous disease.
The spring holiday (Chinese New Year), which came out on 25 January 2020, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese who were urged to stay home for and for many weeks after the outbreak of the new virus infection.
In view of the high level of coronavirus (CoV), which caused the outbreak of a severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) called this virus SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020 and the associated disease, a coronary infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Uhan and spread rapidly throughout the country and then in almost 50 other countries of the world.
As of 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 COVID-19 confirmed cases were detected, more than 40,000 patients recovered, and more than 3,000 patients died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is “an enemy number one for society” and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), less than two months later more than 200 COVID-19 publications, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, hetology, diagnosis and treatment, were published, starting with the first report of 7 January 2020, which identified the sequence of the virus from a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to summarize the results of research in a new and rapidly developing area.
As far as possible, we are trying to compare the COVID-19 with SARS and the other coronary virus, a coronary virus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss known facts on the prevention and forecasting of the flow of the disease, as well as some other issues that are not least pressing.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been among pathogens that are not fatal to humans and are mainly responsible for approximately 15 per cent of general respiratory diseases 4.
However, in this century, we have faced twice the high-pathogenic human coronavirus, i.e. severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and near-east respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which caused the outbreak of diseases originally in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively and soon spread to many other States with a terrible rate of disease and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronary infection in human history.
Figure 1.1 shows that, for the first time, a report on the clusteres of cases of unknown pneumonium origin was submitted to the National Commission for Health of the PRC from Augan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
The first death case was registered on 15 January 2020 in Uhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly in neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, the infection of medicated workers became known, allowing the possibility of transmission of the human virus.
On 23 January, Hurricane was introduced, ending urban public transport.
On 24 January, according to the first clinical study of this disease, 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed coronary virus infection had direct contact with the market for marine products in Uhanan, which was considered to be a starting point for the spread of infection from unknown animals.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the outbreak of coronavirus was a global emergency in public health.
At the time of the preparation of the report, the disease spread throughout China and had already spread to about 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
In view of the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and the level of danger of the outbreak still need to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre clinical study involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented the following updated epidemic development picture (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bdA).
All age groups were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection, but were mainly infected by people between the ages of 30 and 65.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years old, quite few were under 20, and only 14 had not yet reached 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infection in men higher (0.31/100 000) than in women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was distributed by clusteres mainly in the province of Hubei and in the neighbouring regions.
The mean time from the time of occurrence of COVID-19 symptoms to diagnosis was 5 (2-9) days.
The incubation period was on average 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
From the time of onset of symptoms until death, on average, 9.5 (4.8–13) days were observed.
The basic reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
By 23 January 2020, the number of people infected had increased exponentially by the time they were transporting large before the Chinese New Year.
Mortality among patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1.44 per cent (95% CI: 1.10-1.86 per cent) and the patient mortality rate was 3.06 per cent (95% CI: 2.02-4.59 per cent).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 infection were gender (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a sub-family of large shell viruses containing one network of meaningful RNAs.
They can be divided into four types, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma, and deltas, of which alpha and betachoronaviruses are known to attack people.
In the event of a stroke of SARS-MERS-Glycoprotein (S) is associated with cell receptors of angiotensin converting 2-type enzyme (ACE2) and dipeptideylpeptidase-4 (DPP4), respectively, followed by a membrane synthesis.
Cytoplasm is released by virus RNA gene; after the virus gene replication, the gene RNA together with the shellary glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins generates virion-containing compounds that then merge with the membrane, releasing the virus.
The first reports on the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 appeared on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was established as a new type of betachoronavirus, with a gene of 99.98 per cent corresponding to 10 sequence samples collected in the first half of the outbreak of the disease in the Juanan marine market in Uhanan.
Genetically SARS-COV-2 is closer to SARS-COV than to MERS-COV.
With the aid of an e-microcopy of the SARS-CoV-2 particle, a human respiratory epithelial was found in the air-spans.
It has been established that the human enzyme ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, S-protein SARS-COV-2 is associated with ACE2 human enzyme less than in SARS-COV, which explains the fact that SARS-COV-2 causes patients to be less severe than SARS-COV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate a previously unknown short-lived protein coded orf3b and a secretified protein coded orf8.
Orf3b SARS-CoV-2 virus protein can play a role in the pathogen of the virus and suppress IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, a collection of authors in the head of Zjou (Zhou) presented reports on the cryo-electronic tomography of the structure of the full-size ACE2 human farm with 2.9 Å in the B0AT1 tank carrier.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed formations, was collected as a diameter and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, which was evidenced by the identification and infection of the coronary virus.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target in the conduct of a medical box to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate owner
It is known that the source and SARS-COV, and MERS-COV were flying mice, from which the virus was transmitted to the human through the jaws and vertebrates respectively.
Through the phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronary viruses, it was established that the first owners of SARS-CoV-2 are flying mice, as the new virus is 96 per cent identical to two SARS-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown what kind of intermediate masterage has become, which has enabled the virus to overcome the barrier and to infect the human; the route of transmission is still to be identified.
Mr. Czy (Ji) and his colleagues suggested that the virus carriers from flying mice to humans had become snakes, in which the homologous recombination took place in S-protein.
As a result of their study, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou assumed that the pangolins — long-term dairy, which are fed by ants and which are often used in traditional Chinese medicine — are potential intermediate owners of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99-percent genetic similarity between the pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference in 1 per cent between the two genes is very large, so it is considered that the final results with concrete evidence have not yet been obtained (Figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
In laboratory conditions SARS-COV and MERS-COV may survive for 48 hours in the dry environment and for up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and 40 to 50 % humidity.
SARS-COV-2 may have similar properties.
It is known that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and heating up to 56 °C for 30 minutes; effective blocking of the virus activity may be air, 75 per cent ethyl alcohol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, percussion acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chloroxide.
The human population in general does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to the new virus.
There are currently no data on detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can refer only to earlier studies of other coronary viruses, mainly SARS-COV and MERS-COV (Figure 4).
As a rule, the virus that entered the host's body first recognizes the immune system by means of imaging receptors (ORDs), including S-type receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through the various mechanisms, the virus induces the expression of inflammation, dendrite cell formation and interferon synthesis of type I, which inhibit virus proliferation and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages with regard to viral antigens.
However, the N-label SARS-CoV can avoid immune reactions.
Adaptive immune response is soon involved in the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, play an important role in protecting the body.
CD4+ cells stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and CD8+ cells directly kill the virus-affected cells.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help protective cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T-cells by causing their programmable death.
Humoral immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in combating viral infection.
For example, antibodies separated from the healthy patient neutralized the Mers-CoV.
On the other hand, the hyperresponsibility of the immune system involves local education of a large number of free radicals, which may cause serious damage to the light and other organs, and in the worst scenario lead to polyorganic insufficiency and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by a classical manifestation, is more likely to affect elderly people with concomitant pathologies and pregnant women.
The likelihood of infection is higher for people who are affected by a large number of viruses or who have immune system disorders.
According to an analysis of the first 425 cases of infection in Uhanan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 1 to 14 days, mainly 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was an average of 3 days, with a distribution of between 0 and 24 days.
The later study described above, based on population data in 8 866 cases, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the dates of quarantine measures introduced, taking into account the most accurate estimates of the duration of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus to those infected with the disease that is inescapably occurring.
In general, 14-day quarantine has become available for people who have contact with the virus or who are infected with the virus.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptoms of COVID-19 are often high temperatures, which can be the only manifestation or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, difficulty in breathing, muscle pain, headache, throat pain, dizziness, chest pain, diarrhoea, cough and redness.
In some patients a week after the onset of the disease, search and/or hypoxia were observed.
Severe cases of disease have progressed rapidly, and patients have developed severe respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with high temperature and/or respiratory symptoms and severe disease should be tested on the virus for early diagnosis even in the absence of pathologies in the pictures of the chest.
The demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 revealed the following symptoms: 98 per cent high temperature, 76 per cent dry cough, 55 per cent scan and 3 per cent diarrhoea; 8 per cent of patients required light artificial ventilation.
Similar results were obtained as a result of the last two studies in cases of infection in the family and the transmission of the virus from unsymptomatic infected individuals.
Comparative results were obtained in 2012 in the study of patients with MES-CoV, whose main symptoms were also high temperatures (98 per cent), dry cough (47 per cent) and search (55 per cent).
However, 80 per cent of these required artificial ventilation of light, which was much higher than that of COVID-19 patients, and was higher in mortality than in COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high temperatures (99 to 100 %), dry cough (29 to 75 %), swelling (40 to 42 %), diarrhoea (20 to 25 %) and throat pain (13 to 25 %), and the artificial ventilation of mild patients requires 14 to 20 %.
On 14 February, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2 per cent and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
Compared to this, the death rate from SARS to November 2002 was 10 per cent of 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MES, a demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed mortality at 37 per cent of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
As a result of an earlier study, the baseline reproduction rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was defined at 6.47 at 95% confidence interval (CI) between 5.71 and 7.23, whereas R0 for SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
Comparison of SARS-COV-2 with MERS-COV and SARA-COV on symptoms, mortality levels and R0 are shown in Table 1.1.
The above indicators show that SARS-CoV-2 is higher than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the level of mortality in the case of a new virus is lower than the last two.
Thus, maintaining the SARS-COV-2 epidemic would be much more difficult than the MERS-COV and SARS-COV epidemics.
The cluster is often infected within one family or group of people who have gathered together for some reason or who have come together for some transport, such as a cross-liner.
Patients often traveled to Uhan or other affected regions, lived there or contacted the infected or the sick during the last two weeks prior to the onset of the disease.
However, according to the reports, people may be virus carriers without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and patients who have been cured from the hospital may again be virus carriers, and this is a alarming signal for the length of quarantine.
At an early stage, patients had normal or reduced number of leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 had leukocyte-level lymphopaenia < 4×109/L, including leukocyte-level < 1×109/L, as well as elevated asparagin-aminotransferase and virusaemia.
In some patients, elevated levels of liver enzymes, musculoskeletal enzymes and myoglobin were found in the blood, and most patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and blood red cells.
In patients with a severe disease of D-dimmer, the product of fibrin that is present in the blood has been increased and the number of lymphocytes has been continuously reduced.
Most patients with COVID-19 in the X-ray study of the breast cell were diagnosed with pathologies characterized by uneven darkness on both sides or light-glass.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, severe mild injury, and severe respiratory disease (PRC).
In developing POPs, uncontrolled combustion, fluid accumulation and advanced fibrosis lead to a significant gas exchange failure.
Type I and type II pneumatic dysfunction reduces the level of surface-active compounds and increases surface pressure, thus reducing the ability of light to expand and increase the risk of falling light.
Thus, the worst results of X-ray studies often coincide with the most severe cases of disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the detection of pneumonia, the formation of gylin membranes and intertwine lymphocyte infiltrating, and the multi-nuclear synthetic cells in patients who died of disease correspond to viral infections and OSDs and similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
As the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19, the method of detection of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA was used by a polymeric chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (PCR with reverse transcriptase).
However, given the high level of false negative results that could speed up the development of the epidemic, a diagnosis based on clinical manifestations has started in China since 13 February 2020 (no longer relying solely on the reverse transcriptase PCR).
The situation with SARS diagnosis was similar.
Therefore, effective diagnosis is critical and should be combined with the history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and X-ray results.
On 14 February 2020, a group of experts led by Mr. Feng Zhang described the SHERLOCK-based methodology protocol to discover SARS-CoV-2; this methodology allows the synthesis of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA at 20 × 10–18 mol/l to 200 × 10–18 mol/l (10–100 copies per microlitre of the baseline) with less than the time without the use of complex equipment.
This new method, if successfully tested in clinical medicinal products, can significantly improve the sensitivity of tests and facilitate their implementation.
Due to the lack of experience in the treatment of previously unknown coronary viruses, physicians may mainly provide only supportive COVID-19 patients while trying to apply any therapeutic methods used or proposed for the treatment of other coronary viruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of anti-virus drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasmas of healthy patients, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was suggested that even plasma should be used in healthy patients.
Pharmaceutical companies are in a hurry to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
In the initial stages, SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly light, as well as may at least affect other organs expressing ACE2, such as pelvic tract and pouch.
However, failure to work and refusal of breathing are the main threat and cause of patient death.
Thus, support for respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, is critical.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extra-corporeal membrane oxygen (ECMO), a modified method of extra-pulmonary circulation used to treat a life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks is essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2, as well as the protection of vital organ functions.
It is known that cytokine fever is the result of the hyperresponse of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.
The cytokine storm is a form of a systemic combustion process developing in response to a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNg and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immunity to a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of the development of POPs and polyorganizational insufficiency.
In the treatment of cytokine fever, especially in patients in severe conditions, immunosuppression is essential.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, monoclonal antibodies serving as interlequinase-6 inhibitors were used to treat cytokine storms.
Other methods of treating cytokines based on immunosuppression include modulation of the immune response to T-cell control; inhibition of cytokines of IFN-g, IL-1, and TNF; suppression of yanus-kinase; use of blinatumumab, cytokine-signalling supressors 4 and hytondeasetase inhibitors.
In order to reduce the severity of inflammatory processes when treating SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as immune donors.
However, high-dose steroids do not benefit from the treatment of severe mild injuries in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially auscullar osteonecrosis, which significantly worsen the forecast.
However, short courses of corticosteroids at small and medium doses are recommended to be used with caution when treating patients with COVID-19 in critical condition.
There is no confirmed effective anti-virus therapy at the time of the preparation of the document.
However, the internal introduction of remedesivir, a nucleotide analogue, has been an effective treatment for the American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a newly developed anti-virus drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
Later, remedesivir also demonstrated the possibility of suppressing other viruses with one-off RNA, including Mers and SARS viruses.
Based on these data, Gilead provided this medicinal product to China for peer studies in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies were eagerly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were proposed as possible options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combination treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir may be accompanied by diarrhoea, cough, redness, hepatic impairment and other side effects.
The interaction of these medicinal products with other medicinal products administered to patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma of healthy patients and the development of antibodies
Blood collection in infected patients has been used for the treatment of other patients with the same disease or for the protection of the healthy population for a long time.
In fact, the blood of healed patients often contains relatively high levels of antibodies to fight pathogens.
The antibodies are in immunoglobulin, produced by B-lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual pathogen molecules and neutralize them.
Based on this requirement, plasma was derived from blood samples of the group of patients treated with COVID-19, which were then introduced to 10 severely ill patients.
During 24 hours, their symptoms improved, the intensity of inflammation and viral load decreased, as well as increased oxygen blood saturation.
However, in order to suggest that the method be applied to the media prior to specific therapy, no verification or clarification is required.
In addition, due to the therapeutic effect, some plasma-related deficiencies should be carefully investigated.
For example, antibodies may overstimulate the immune system and cause cytokine emission syndrome, which, given its toxicity, poses a potential risk to life.
The blood antibody concentration is usually low, and the plasmas for treating patients in a critical state are very much needed.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to address the global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and more practical to assign B cells of healthy patients and to identify the genetic code of effective antibodies or to conduct a screening to find effective antibodies against critically important proteins of the virus.
So we can go straight to the mass production of antibodies.
The Chinese used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends largely on the combination of many components of the formula, which is different from the diagnosis of the disease based on the theories of Chinese traditional medicine.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or have unspecified action, as the allocation and verification of these components or their optimal combination seems difficult.
Today, due to the lack of effective specific treatment of COVID-19, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative treatment methods for patients with mild and moderate severity of symptoms or for patients recovering from a severe disease.
For example, Shu Feng Cze Du capsules (Shu Feng Je Du) and Lian Hua Cin Wenn capsules (Lian Hua Qing Wen) were found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest proportion of healthy patients with COVID-19 was observed in several provinces of China, where Chinese traditional medicine was used for treatment of 87 per cent of patients, including in Ghana (63.7%), Ninse (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while in the province of Hubei, where Chinese traditional medicine was used for treatment of only about 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19, the lowest proportion of healthy patients (13 per cent) was recorded.
However, this is a rather rough comparison, as the assessment should take into account the number of other factors of exposure, such as the number of patients and the severity of their disease.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang (Boli Zhang) and his colleagues published research materials that compared treatment with Western medicine and combined treatment with Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the time-limits for normalization of body temperature, symptoms and hospital care were less sensitive in patients treated with Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in patients treated with Western methods alone.
The most surprising is the fact that the proportion of patients who started to develop symptoms (from mild to severe) was seen below in a group treated by combining Western and Chinese traditional medical methods than in a group treated only by Western methodologies (7.4 per cent compared to 46.2 per cent), while the death rate in the first group was lower than in the second group (8.8 per cent compared to 39 per cent).
However, the effectiveness and safety of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more closely controlled research carried out in more and more regions.
It is also of interest to obtain, as soon as possible, a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of the aspects of the effectiveness of the components used in the Chinese traditional medicine methods or their combination.
Patients who suspect or confirmed the existence of COVID-19 are mainly afraid of acute and even fatal diseases, and quarantined people are also suffering fatigue, loneliness and extreme anger.
In addition, infections such as nausea, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as the insomnia from corticosteroids, may cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.
Early outbreaks of the SARS virus have reported a number of psychiatric diseases, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor ingestion, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicide.
Compulsory monitoring of contacts and quarantines, among the measures taken by health authorities to prevent the COVID-19 epidemic, can raise people's concern and guilt over the spread of infection, quarantine and social clima on their families and friends.
In this context, psychological and psychiatric assistance should be provided to patients with COVID-19, suspects and contacters, as well as to all others required.
In the context of psychological support, multidisciplinary psychiatric assistance teams should be formed, providing clear information with regular and accurate updating of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans and using professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in stopping the transmission chain from vectors of infection and infected people to susceptible owners and are often used in addition to anti-virus therapy used to prevent new viruses.
Work on the establishment of S-protein vaccines was carried out to produce long-lived and high-acting neutralising antibodies and/or protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
Animal studies have developed live weakened SARS vaccines.
However, prior to the start of clinical studies, the effectiveness of these possible vaccines should be further determined in the natural environment when used in elderly patients, the pattern of fatal dose infection and the level of protection against infection with zoonosed viruses.
Perhaps the reason is that SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and since then no new case has been reported.
At the same time, the sporadic cases and disease clusteres caused by the Mers virus in the Middle East and spread to other regions continue to occur through the conservation of zoonotic sources in endemic habitats.
Vaccination strategies have been developed to combat mers, using inactivated virus, plasma DNA, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral particles and components of recombinant proteins, and some of these strategies have been evaluated in animals.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for individuals with no immunity is an urgent and critical challenge that requires a decision to prevent the epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long (average 18 months) duration necessary for the development of the vaccine and the dynamic development of coronary viruses.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to show a full picture of the clinical flow of the disease from thousands of patients.
In most cases patients are able to recover gradually without difficulty.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with high frequency of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
Therefore, it is critical for health bodies to develop a forecasting disease model to identify the priority of their action, especially in areas where resources are scarce.
Based on current clinical studies, the following factors may affect or be associated with the forecasting of disease in patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: age was the most important factor in predicting the flow of the disease caused by the SARS virus, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients aged 30 to 65 years, 47.7 per cent of whom are over 50 years of age, according to the study mentioned above, 8 866 cases.
Patients who were required to undergo intensive therapy were more likely to have baseline diseases and complications and were significantly older than those who did not require such therapy (mean 66 years compared with 51 years of age), indicating that age was a predictive factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infection in men above (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as mentioned above.
Sickness and difficulty: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive therapy are more likely to develop severe myocardial and arrhythmia.
Cardiological events were also the main cause of the death of patients with SARS.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 could also be associated with ACE2 positive holangiocytes, which could cause liver failure in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and baseline diseases are closely interlinked and can distort results.
The deviations found in laboratory studies: the level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage and is proposed to be considered as a potential predictive factor in the flow of the disease, response to therapy and final healing.
It was also proposed to take into account the relationship between the level of C-reactive protein, the severity of the disease and the prediction of COVID-19.
In addition, the results can also predict an increased level of lactate dehydrogenase, asparagin aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and creatinine.
These enzymes are distributed in large quantities by various organs, especially by the heart and the liver, and their emissions occur when the tissues are damaged.
Therefore, they are traditional markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: X-ray data on the chest cell and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be taken into account to predict the results and complications of treatment with COVID-19.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants widely used in infectious diseases as additional therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
As corticosteroids have been widely used to treat patients with severe SARS, many of the patients with a history of osteonecrosis have developed, resulting in life-threatening disability and low quality of life.
Therefore, if steroids are to be used to treat patients with COVID-19, these should be administered at small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, many patients suffer from unexpected severe stress in the background of the COVID-19 epidemic, as they often have to endure long quarantine periods, face high uncertainty and see the deaths of their relatives and other patients.
In order to relieve stress and help such patients return to normal life, psychological consultations and long-term support must be conducted with them.
According to demographic studies at present, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to lower respiratory tract replication, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as other coronary viruses that cause common cold diseases, can successfully reproduce in upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or not at all symptoms at the early stages of infection.
Therefore, patients with an early stage of disease or who have not yet completed the incubation period may, through their normal life, spread the virus to a significant extent, which significantly hampers epidemiological control.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV virus was considered to occur when patients were severely ill, most of which did not occur at the early stages of the infection.
Thus, the COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious today and is more difficult to control.
China is now doing a great deal of work, announcing a global quarantine in Uhan and neighboring cities, as well as an extended quarantine regime for almost the entire population in order to stop the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
While these measures have a significant economic and other aspects of the country ' s life, the number of new patients identified has decreased, thus slowing the spread of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic estimates, the outbreak of the disease will end in March and the drought phase will extend from 3 to 4 months.
Some experts, however, are less optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter and his colleagues took the view that the COVID-19 explosion, which was much more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from the group led by Ira Longini (Ira Longini) formed a model to predict the end of the epidemic and assumed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could defeat two thirds of the world ' s population.
The group of Canadian experts reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was found in the nose and throats of patients who were cured and hospitalized two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to influenza.
However, a reduction in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that the current strategy may have had an impact.
According to the original projections, the Ebola disease was to be defeated by up to a million people and caused the death of half a million patients.
But by means of severe quarantine and isolation of the disease, it was finally able to be controlled.
It is likely that, like the SARS-CoV virus, the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be weakened and over time it will disappear or become less pathogenic to humans.
The following is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (Ris. 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through cough or sneezing, as well as possibly through direct contact with virus-contaminated materials.
The virus was also found in the cage, which means that it is also possible to transmit orally.
According to one recent study, 41 per cent of 138 patients were reported to have been infected in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously detected diseases and 40 patients with disease.
Serious precautions should therefore be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even foreigners who are in contact with patients or infected.
The first line of defense for reducing the risk of infection is the wearing of masks for the person; and surgical masks, and N95-type respirators (Series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks do not give the microcaple of liquids from potentially infected to fly into the air and sit on surfaces from which they can be transferred to the environment.
However, only N95 (Series No. 1860s) can protect against the vibration of viruses of 10 to 80 nm, they miss only 5 per cent of viruses; SARS-CoV-2 virus of the same size as SARS-CoV, and both are about 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even through five surgical masks combined, medical personnel directly contacting patients must wear N95 masks (Series No. 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical workers should wear a protective helmet mounted on the figure to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also fall into the body through the eye.
On 22 January 2020, the doctor infected SARS-COV-2 despite wearing a N95 class mask; the virus may have fallen into his body through a burning eye.
Medical workers should therefore also wear transparent face shields or protective eyes of a closed type.
It is strongly recommended that all populations in affected or potentially threatened regions should wash their hands regularly by means of mine disinfectants, avoid self-insulation, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
The acceptable distance to the patient is considered to be about a meter.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not previously known to humanity, the high level of its similarity to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, was to become a alarming signal to China, taking into account the experience they acquired during the SARS blast in 2003.
However, only after 19 January 2020, the Director of the Centre for Disease Control in Uhanan calmed the citizens, stating that the new virus had low contagion and limited reproductiveity when transferring from human to human and that the prevention and control of the disease would not be a problem.
This statement significantly reduced social tension, especially during the time when the whole country was ready to celebrate China ' s New Year, and a critical time was missed when the disease could be held within Mr. Uhanan ' s minimum loss limits.
China ' s health authorities can take this severe lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, since each word is taken into account by citizens and may affect their attitude and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more closely to the unusual information coming from the clinic rather than waiting for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more decisive measures to prevent the potential epidemic in the early stages of its development and not to calm the public; and (4) conduct more targeted and effective lessons to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and regular testing and improvement of the response system.
The COVID-19 blast caused by previously unsolicited severe second-type severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) started at the end of December 2019.
Less than two months later, the disease covered China as a whole and had spread to 50 countries around the world at the time of its preparation.
Because the virus is very similar to a severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), a reaction of COVID-19 occurred.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS with regard to the prevention of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women; the proportion of serious cases and the level of mortality among older people is also higher than among young people.
Deaths due to SARS are higher than in the case of COVID-19 (10.91 per cent compared to 1.44 per cent).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even when the disease is unsymptomatic, while patients with SARS are usually infected only in severe cases, thus preventing the spread of COVID-19 is more difficult than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-COV-2 is spread much faster and larger than SARS-COV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative conventional samples available for SARS-COV-2 RNA.
On the other hand, treated patients may again show positive samples of the virus.
All of this significantly increases the risk of virus proliferation.
In the light of such rapid progress in the COVID-19 studies, some key issues remain unresolved, namely:
What is the origin of SARS-CoV-2?
Despite the detection of a 96-percent gomologist between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like flying mouse coronary viruses, we still cannot claim that the SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred from flying mice.
What animal became an intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original owner, for example from flying mice, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to the first and the second questions, we can't really stop the transfer path, and the epidemiological situation can get worse at any time.
Modelling at the molecular level and biochemical samples showed that SARS-CoV-2 is related to ACE2, but how exactly is the virus introduced into respiratory tract cells and caused subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also associated with ACE2 cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to those questions, we cannot ensure a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic continue?
How does the virus evolve in the process of human transfer?
Will it be the cause of the world pandemic, will it also disappear like SARS, or will it periodically relapse like the flu?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.
Origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the coevolution of coronal viruses (CoV) and their carriers, including people, for thousands of years.
By 2003, two human coronary viruses (HcoV) were known to cause a mild disease, such as normal cold.
The outbreaks of severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have changed our perception of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronary disease can be.
The occurrence of a severe second-type severe respiratory syndrome coronary virus (SARS-CoV-2) in central China at the end of 2019 refocused on the coronary viruses and surprised us with high transmission, but with a weaker pathogenicity of the virus compared to the SARS-CoV family virus.
Coronavirus human infection is a zoonose, and understanding of its origin will be very useful.
Most human coronaviruses come from flying mice for which they are not pathogens.
There are also known intermediate reservoirs of some human coronaviruses.
The definition of animal carriers directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
Studying the interaction of animals that carry coronary viruses can also shed light on the pathogen of coronary virus in humans.
In this review, we provide data on the seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their discovery and their zoonotic origins and ways of intervising.
It is important to note that we compare and compare various human coronaviruses in terms of virus evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, today's disease epidemic caused by the coronary virus found in 2019 (COVID-19) is also being considered.
In addition, the conditions necessary for the successful exchange of carriers are noted and the effect of the virus on the severity of the disease.
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of vertebral viruses with one positive-polar chain of RNA.
These viruses with the largest RNA-containing viruses of between 26 and 32,000 nucleotides have been named because of their form that reminds the crown when considered under the electronic microscope.
In terms of structure, coronaviruses contain unsegmented genes with an identical organization.
About two thirds of the genomes contain two large open partial envelopes (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are transmitted to the polyproteins of the replicas pp1a and pp1ab.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins marked nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains an open accounting framework for structured proteins, including skeletal protein (S), shell protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Other lines of coronavirus also coded a number of line-specific accessory proteins.
Based on differences in the sequences of white\ coronaviruses are divided into four species (alpha, beta, gamma, and deltacoronaviruses), including most human coronaviruses (A, B, C and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that the majority of alpha and beta-coronaviruses are flying mice and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma and deltacoronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have been overcoming interstellar barriers, and some of them have evolved into pathogens that are dangerous to humans.
To this day, seven human coronaviruses are known.
These include human alphachoronaviruses HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63.
The other five beta-coronaviruses include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), close-east respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe severe secondary SARS-CoV-2 respiratory syndrome.
Human coronaviruses HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 usually cause symptoms of mild form, such as cold and/or diarrhoea.
Unlike these, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently detected SARS-CoV-2 virus are highly pathogenic, causing severe infections of lower respiratory pathways in a relatively higher number of patients with a higher probability of developing acute respiratory disease (ORS) and developing emergency symptoms.
The first human coronavirus line HCoV-229E, B814, was obtained from a sample of patients who had a cold disease in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive studies have provided more detailed information on HCV-229E and HCV-OC43 viruses, which cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, before the outbreak of severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that human coronary infection was generally considered harmless.
The SARS blast in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in the current history; more than 8,000 people were affected and the overall mortality rate was approximately 10 per cent.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a long epidemic in the Arab Peninsula, while the disease spread dramatically in the rest of the world.
The new human coronary virus (2019-nCoV) found in 2019, subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the originator of the current epidemic of coronary infection 2019 (COVID-19), which increased by more than 3,120 lives as of 3 March 2020, with over 91,000 people being infected.
A warning signal is received, and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have zoonotic origins, their source is flying mice, mice or domestic animals.
Many data sets show the benefits of the evolution of all human coronaviruses from flying mice, whose viruses have adapted well and do not exhibit pathogenic properties, but demonstrate a wide variety of genetics.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed a serious health, scientific, social and moral challenge to China and the world.
A study of the zoonotic mechanism of the origin of human coronaviruses will enable them to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution and the factors limiting intervising transmission.
It may also indicate or accelerate the search for a reservoir, intermediate and amplifying SARS-CoV-2 carrier, which is very important to prevent the recurrence of disease in the future.
This review contains general information on the origin of zoonoses, inter-visual transmission and pathogens of human coronary viruses.
In particular, we identify and consider the following general feature: the source viruses from which human coronary viruses have occurred are usually not pathogens for their reservoirs, but acquire pathogens after the inter-vise transmission to the new carrier.
We are also analysing the trend in human coronavirus evolution, according to which increased transferability is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogens.
In the same context, the result of the current SARS-CoV-2 blast is also being considered.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the strain B814 of the HCV-229E virus was first obtained from a sample separated from the bone marrow of patients who have a cold, different coronaviruses were found in various infected animals, including the indexes, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In recent decades, seven human coronary viruses have been identified.
Table 1 provides a brief history of the chronic detection of human coronaviruses.
The first strain of the HCV-229E virus was obtained from samples taken from the respiratory pathways of patients with infection of the upper respiratory tract in 1966; the virus was further adapted to the reproduction of WI-38.
Patients infected with HCV-229E had mild symptoms, including headache, vomiting, general malaise and throat pain, with high temperatures and cough in 10-20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCOV-OC43 virus was derived from the organic culture and subsequent serial passage in the brain of mouse conjunctivities.
The clinical signs of HCV-OC43 virus infection are similar to those of HCV-229E virus infection, whose symptoms are unique to those of other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A and rhinovirus viruses.
Both the HCV-229E virus and the HCV-OC43 virus have widespread spread around the world and are usually transmitted in winter at moderate intervals.
The main incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by approximately two weeks of disease.
According to the study of volunteers, healthy people infected with HCV-229E developed a normal simple form.
Only a few patients with weak immunity experienced severe lower respiratory tract infection.
The SARS blast, also known as the “Atypical Pneumonia epidemic”, has become the first in all history of humanity a well-documented pandemic caused by human coronary disease, and the virus SARS-CoV, a third of the human coronavirus detected, has been the cause of the disease.
The first case of SARS was detected at the end of 2002 in the province of Guangdun, China.
During the SARS epidemic, 8 096 cases of disease and 774 deaths were documented and the disease spread in many countries and on various continents.
Without taking into account the superactive distributors, it was estimated that each patient could be infected by about two more persons; the incubation period was between 4 and 7 days, and the viral load peak was on the 10th day of the disease.
In patients infected with SARS-COV, muscle pain, headaches, high temperature, general malaise and swelling occurred initially, and later symptoms included swelling, cough, and respiratory failure.
The prevalence of laboratory deviations from the SARS standard is lymphopenia, liver failure and elevated creatinine levels.
Patients with SARS also experienced diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells, and increased macrophages.
Some 20-30 per cent of patients subsequently require intensive therapy and mechanical ventilation.
In such severe cases, other organs, including gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, may also be infected in addition to the lower respiratory tract, which is usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which may be fatal, especially for patients with impaired immunity.
For the first time, the virus was derived from the open biopsy of a mild relative who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, tremendous efforts have been made to study human coronary viruses.
At the end of 2004, HCOV-NL63 was granted to a 7-month child from the Netherlands.
Initially, it was found that it was mainly affecting children of younger age, older people and patients with reduced immunity and respiratory diseases.
For the disease caused by HCV-NL63, there are signs such as nasmork, conjunctivitis, high temperature and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study describes the same virus from the native material taken from an 8-month-old boy from the Netherlands suffering pneumonia.
The virus was found in the Netherlands, but it actually spread everywhere.
It is estimated that HCV-NL63 is the cause of approximately 4.7 per cent of widespread respiratory diseases and the peaks of the diseases it causes are in the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is linked to an obstructive laringitis, which is also called a crust.
HCOV-HKU1 was granted in Hong Kong in the same year by a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to insomnia and bronchiolitis, HCOV-HKU1 is associated with an increase in asthma.
Like HCV-NL63, HCV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 virus, causing respiratory diseases in easy form, have been detected worldwide.
All these four human coronary viruses, which cause extracurricular infections, have been well adapted to people, and their mutations, resulting in highly pathogenic diseases, are generally unlikely, although their causes were unknown, as in a rare case with a more virulent subtype of HCV-NL63, which, according to recent reports, has caused a serious infection of lower respiratory pathways in China.
Usually, by acquiring the ability to effectively transfer and maintain human body, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenic.
For the first time in 2012, the presence in Saudi Arabia of a mild 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and initial insufficiency was a coronary virus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV).
Most laboratoryly confirmed cases have taken place in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia there have been cases of transport and spread through episodes of secondary infection in close contact.
Another second blast with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
Clinical manifestations of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) remind of symptoms of severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) — both infections are characterised by advanced acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MES have also developed a severe initial insufficiency, which still distinguishes MES from the other diseases caused by coronary viruses that are transmitted to humans.
More than 30 per cent of patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and redness.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratoryly confirmed cases of high mortality-related near-east respiratory syndrome (34.4%) have been recorded, and MERS-COV is therefore considered one of the most deadly viruses known to man.
From mid to the end of December 2019, patient clusters of pneumonia patients were identified in Uhana Province of Cuba, which, in the past, are now associated with the infection caused by severe severe type 2 respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization has announced that the ongoing outbreak of low respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global emergency in public health, and the disease itself has been called “coronavirus infection 19” (COVID-19).
As at 3 March 2020, 90,053 confirmed cases were registered worldwide, with mortality being approximately 3.4%.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in the Chinese province of Hubei is 4.2 per cent and 1.2 per cent beyond its borders.
SARS-CoV-2, like the SARS and MERCS, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by increased temperature, cough and swelling.
Diarrhoea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and is able to rapidly enter severe respiratory failure syndrome.
Despite the similarity between SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses form various phylogenetic trees.
SARS-COV-2 is obviously less pathogenic but has a greater ability to transfer than SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Cases of unsymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection have been recorded, indicating the ability of this virus to spread rapidly worldwide.
The comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses reveal important similarities and differences.
First, coronavirus transmissions have a similar incubation period and the duration of the disease they cause.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the same trend as the rest of the six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four human coronary viruses causing infective infections (e.g. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections are similar to those that are most frequently observed in human coronary infections causing infective infections, including non-specific manifestations, mild symptoms or even lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, a small subset of serious cases of COVID-19 can be identified, although the ratio is slightly below.
Thirdly, the purpose of the SARS-COV-2 transfer is also to note the interesting legal features of both human coronaviruses causing infective infections and SARS-COV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as human coronaviruses causing infective infections.
On the other hand, it is still to be checked whether the transmission of SARS-COV-2 with each subsequent virus transition (i.e. the infection of each next human being) is reduced, as in the SARS-COV and MERS-COV cases.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause infective infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in specimens of kala.
We still have to answer the question of whether the faecal-oral route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least in some circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
The issue of the possible SARS-CoV-2 season is also of particular interest to human coronaviruses that cause infectious infections.
However, the future development of the continuing COVID-19 explosion will depend on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transferability, pathogenesis and sustainable distribution following human transition.
All four human coronaviruses, which cause extra-sick infections with mild form symptoms, have been well adapted to people.
On the other hand, they may well have adapted to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both those and others could be called the only survivors after the pandemics of human coronary viruses in the past.
Human coronaviruses that cause serious diseases in humans, and people in whom human coronaviruses cause serious diseases simply did not survive.
In order for this to happen, human coronaviruses should be reflected in the human body to a sufficient extent in order to accumulate adaptive mutations that are contrary to the carrier ' s limitation factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 blast is extended and the more people are infected, the more likely the virus is fully adapted to the human being.
If it is well adapted, its transmission to people will be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infectious control activities.
For many years, four outpatient coronaviruses have been circulating among the population, causing a normal cold in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require an animal-reservatory.
The high-level coronation viruses SARS-COV and MERS-COV have not adapted to a person sufficiently well, and their transmission to humans cannot be supported.
They need to remain and reproduce in their zoos and seek a case of falling into susceptible human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate or aggravating carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has drawings similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV, and four HCOV invertebrates.
It is very easy to deliver, at least at the present time, as an inpatient HCV.
But he's more pathogen than insomnia HCV, and less pathogen than SARS-COV or MERS-COV.
It remains to be seen whether it is fully adapted to the human being and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate animal carrier.
Before discussing the origin of HCOV viruses, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolution, natural, intermediate, strengthening and reserve carriers of HCOV viruses.
The animal serves as the evolutionary carrier of HCOV if it carries a near-natural ancestor with the same high homology at the level of the sequence of nucleotides.
The previous virus is usually well-adapted and unpathogenic in this carrier.
Similarly, the carrier shall carry HCOV continuously for a long time.
In both cases, carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCOV or its parental virus.
In contrast, if HCOV was only taken into the intermediate carrier directly before or about the time it was taken into the person, it was not well adapted to the new carrier and often pathogen.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of a booster by allowing the virus to be Molnesianly replicationd and then transferred to its people by increasing the level of human infection.
HCOV may carry a topical infection if it cannot withstand intra-intermediate transmission.
On the contrary, HCOV viruses can also be adapted to the intermediate carrier and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural reserve carrier.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that a zero-patient SARS had a history of contact with hunting and fishing animals.
Further studies of sero-prevalence showed that the prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-COV virus was higher in animal dealers than in the general population.
The Himalayan worms (Paguma larvata) and the anonymised dog in the animal markets have become the first identified carriers of viruses, similar to almost identical SARS-CoV.
This has been explicitly confirmed by the fact that, after the destruction of all civil society in the markets, SARS cases were no longer reported.
At the same time, it was reported that, in most cases, the GMOs living in the wild or on farms and not on the market did not determine which would lead to the conclusion that the GMOs could only serve as an intermediate booster rather than a natural SARS-COV reservoir.
It is noteworthy that since 80 per cent of the different animals in the Guangjou markets have anti-SARS-CoV, it is unlikely that intermediate enhancers can also serve many small dairy species.
They all seem to be the deadliest carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.
The subsequent search for the natural animal carrier SARS-CoV identified a native coV flying mouse, which was called the atypical pneumonia-related coronavirus of HKU3 (SARSR-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) flying mouse, which is present in Chinese flying mice.
These mice are positive for the SARS-CoV antibody and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other coronaviruses of flying mice have the same homology of nucleotide sequences as SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundations for a new concept that flying mice were the carriers of new human pathogens.
The flying mice also detected several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV), but none other than one that represents WIV1, cannot be isolated as a live virus.
It is known that SARS-CoV receptor is a human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It was shown that WIV1, obtained from a sample of fly-mouse faecals, uses ACE2 fly-mouses, jaws and humans as a receiver for entering the cell.
It's curious that the strains of healthy patients with SARS could neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest relative of SARS-CoV in flying mice, dividing 95 per cent of the nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, WIV1 is generally considered not to be a direct parental virus SARS-CoV, and flying mice are not a direct replacement carrier of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis refers to the same group as the CoV-HKU4 flyers and the CoV-HKU5 flyers.
CoV-HKU4 flyers and MERS-COV use the same carrier receptor, dipeptildipeptide-4 (DPP4), to penetrate viruses.
The follow-up to the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerisation of the MERS-CoV virus is phylogenetically closer to the sequences of beta-coronaviruses flying in Europe and Africa.
So far, the wild-flying mouse has not found a live Mers-CoV virus.
Mers-CoV and its closest family member CoV-HKU25 are only 87 per cent of the number of nucleotide sequences.
That is, flying mice could not be the direct replacement carrier of the Mers-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-bred camels are seropositive to neutralized antibodies, specific to MERS-CoV, as well as vervades of Middle East origin in many African countries.
The live Mers-CoV, the human-detected virus, was derived from the corpusal brains of single-curved vertebrae, which further confirms the role of vertebrae as true reservoirs of Mers-CoV.
It is also worth noting that small symptoms have been observed in vertebral vertebrates that are experimentally infected with MERS-CoV, but that there has been a massive virus division.
It is remarkable that infected viruses have not only provided the virus with a respirator but also with an faecal oral route, which is also the main source of the virus in flying mice.
However, there are still questions, as many confirmed cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome have not been in the history of contact with females prior to the onset of symptoms and are likely to be related to the human transfer or to the transfer of unknown channels including unestablished species of animals that are the carriers of MERS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide homology is 96.2% consistent with the CoV RatG13 flying mice assigned to the Asian sub-coordinates of Rhinolophus affinis.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the distinction between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is too large to attribute parental relations to them.
That is, flying mice could and would not be the direct spare carrier of SARS-CoV-2 unless almost identical coronaviruses of flying mice were found in the future.
The direct carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus must be among the wild species sold and killed in the underworld of marine products, which have been associated with many of the initial cases of COVID-19, which shows the likelihood of animal transfer.
A few recent studies based on metagenome sequencing have concluded that a group at risk of the destruction of small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) was also able to carry a parent betachoronavirus, a family team of SARS-CoV-2.
The homology of the sequences of these new pangoline coronavirus genes 85-92% coincides with SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely related to RatG13, with the identity of the nucleotide sequences being approximately 90 per cent.
They are classified in two lines of the differentiation of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in a phylogenetic tree, one of which is a receptor-binding domain (RSD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with a 97.4 per cent amino acid sequence.
On the contrary, the SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 strains are more divergent, despite the higher degree of homology of sequences across the genome.
The earlier study of pangoline patients also reported the identification of viral conditions in light samples, which were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
In this study, other methods of collection and manual processing were used to obtain the sequence of the genome, which included about 86.3 per cent of the full-size viral genome.
It cannot be excluded that pangoline has become one of the intermediate animals of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the differentiation of the sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and pangoline beta-conaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangoline.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and batacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolution path of SARS-CoV-2 in flying mice, pangolins and other dairy animals has not yet been established.
At that time, the highest sequence homology was found in the RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronaviruses of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 with the highest sequence homology throughout the genome.
The high degree of similarity between pangoline betachoronaviruses, family SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 is related to parallel evolution through selectiveity.
The opposite proposal is for the recombination between the pangoline betachoronavirus, the family SARS-CoV-2, and RatG13 in the third type of wild animals.
As the driving force of evolution, the recombination is widely distributed among beta-coronaviruses.
There is still no final decision on the direct zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCV viruses, the zoonotic origin of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 viruses is also studied.
Philogenetic evidence shows that both HCV-NL63 and HCV-229E can be derived from flying mouse coronary viruses, while parental strains of HCV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 are found in rodents.
It has been reported that the coronavirus of flying mice called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and discovered in the North American tricolored psoriasis demonstrates a close relationship with HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCV-229E is genetically related to another coronavirus called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that its intermediate carrier could also be female.
For the sake of clarity, the modern knowledge of the origin of known coronary viruses is summarised in Figure 1 and in Table 2.
The philogenic analysis provided evidence of the events of the intervisal transmission of HCOV in anamnese.
When the HCoV-OC43 virus was transmitted in an intervised manner around 1890 and people were infected with domestic animals, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of the HCV-229E inter-visual transmission is not so clear.
Alphachoronaviruses of flying mice, near-natural HCV-229E were detected.
There is an alpaca alphaconavirus among them.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from flying mice.
First of all, it's people, not alpacas, who could contact flying mice in a common environmental niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with the alpines.
Second, alphaconaviruses of flying mice, family HCV-229E, are diverse and non-pathogenic in flying mice, while alphaconavirus caused respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alphaconavirus was not found in wild animals.
Thus, it cannot be ruled out that the alphaquinavirus, family HCV-229E, has been obtained from humans.
In fact, flying mice are a direct source of human pathogens, including the virus of obesity, the virus of Ebola, the virus of Nipah and the virus of Hendra.
It is not surprising, therefore, that flying mice could direct their transmission to people of HCV-229E.
On the other hand, while the alphaquinaviruses of flying mice were able to serve a gene pool of HCV-229E virus, alpacas and uni-curves could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of the Mers-CoV virus.
MERS-COV is an excellent example of intervising transmission from flying mice to single-curves and single-curves to human beings.
The evolution of the Mers-CoV virus from flying mice is known for its initial identification and was subsequently confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is obvious that flying mice provide a rich pool of viruses for intervising gene fragments and intervising transmission.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and ability to fly make flying mice “ideal distributors”.
On the other hand, the Mers-CoV virus was introduced to single-headed camels decades ago.
He adapted well to those camels that had become a stable and natural reserve carrier from the intermediate carrier.
These animals have a very mild disease and have a relatively low rate of mutations.
Its episodic transmission to a person is an accident, and the person remains a dull carrier of MERS-COV because its transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the Mers-CoV transmission, the role of the pangolins, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is different.
In particular, pangoline beta-coronaviruses are highly pathogenic to the pangoline.
They may be the bats of beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as strains in the SARS-CoV case.
In future studies it is necessary to confirm or delete a number of possibilities for intervising the SARS-CoV-2 virus from animals.
First, flying mice may be a replacement carrier for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
People can share an environmental niche with flying mice through the eyelids or the separation of the tissues of these animals.
Second, the pangoline may be one of the intermediate boosters in which the SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently occurred.
People are infected with the virus through the separation of dust and use in the food of wild animals.
Many animals, including domestic animals, may be accepted by SARS-CoV-2.
The examination of domestic and wild animals on the antibody is justified.
Third, as indicated above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could occur in a third form, which contacted both flying mice and pangoline.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to the different types of animal carriers, three major factors from viruses have also contributed to cross-border barriers.
First of all, they are relatively high rate of mutations in the RNA replica.
Compared to other viruses with one-off RNA, the estimated frequency of coronary mutations can be considered to be “moderately high” with the mean frequency of replacement of approximately 10-4 per year in one section 2 according to the adaptation phase of the coronary virus to new owners.
Coronaviruses have a adjusting exoribionuclease, which removes the extremely high rate of mutation and weakness or even inability to live.
Interestingly, the remdecivir nucleotide analogue suppresses the replication of coronavirus due to the inhibition of exoribanuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Reddesivir is one of the most promising means against SARS-CoV-2 to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the frequency of coronary mutations is almost a million times higher than that of their carriers.
In addition, the frequency of mutations may often be even higher if coronaviruses are not well adapted to the carrier.
Compared to SARS-CoV with the high rate of mutation, the rate of mutations SARS-CoV-2 is shown below, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Apparently, the virus has already been adapted to another carrier close to the human being.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, well-adapted to single-bred camels.
It is theoretically unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antivirals will lose their effectiveness rapidly as a result of a genetic drive.
Second, the large RNA gene in the coronavirus leads to greater plasticity in the genomic modification of mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of interrelationship favourable to the emergence of new coronaviruses under appropriate conditions.
This contributes to a number of unique open accounting and protein functions coded in the 3′-end of the genome.
Thirdly, thanks to the unique mechanism for selecting the matrix, coronaviruses randomly and often switch the matrix during the replication of the RNA.
During the transcription of coronavirus DNA into the carrier, which serves as a mixing vessel, a switch is often made.
High-level and subgenomous RNAs can recombinate and create new coronaviruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in both HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43 and in animal coronaviruses such as SL-COV and batCoV-HKU9 flying mice.
Interaction of the virus-bearer with respect to transmission
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, the virus interaction with the carrier receptor is another key factor that is important for inter-visual transmission.
In this article, as a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in the event of inter-visual transmission, the SARS-CoV recombination is provided.
Based on a comparative analysis between human SARS-COV strains and strains, SARS-COV is considered to be undergoing rapid adaptation in different carriers, especially with regard to RSD mutations of white S.
In general, RSD is a coronavirus protein that interacts with the cell receptor, and the carrier's antibody response is intensively selecting it.
The SARS-CoV RSDs are amino acids, with 318 to 510 on the S1 fragment, which are associated with an angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (APF2) and its receptors for the introduction of the virus into the cell.
The SARS-CoV virus RSD is capable of identifying the APF2 receptors of various animals, including mouse, turtles, mice and dogs, making it possible to intervise the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found in the RSD, which are different from human viral strains and intestines, with 4 of them in the binding receptor motive for interaction with the APF2 receptor.
SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in the RSD, which may increase the affinity of the interaction of the turtle with the human receptor APF2.
In other words, these two amino acids can be particularly important for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-COV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-COV.
The 30 per cent difference between SARS-COV-2 and SARS-COV in the S1 protein S segment suggests that the binding affinity of the S protein to the human APF2 could change.
Indeed, a cryoelectronic microscopy study says that the affinity of this relationship is 10-20 times higher than between APF2 human and S-sars-CoV virus protein.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other rectifiers are required to transmit SARS-CoV-2.
It is surprising that HCoV-NL63 is also associated with APF2, but with another segment of protein S.
There are many other HCV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCV-229E and 9-O-acetyl acid for HCV-OC43.
They can also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses to humans after inter-visiting from animal carriers.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of the inter-view transmission of HCoV is also managed by other factors of dependency and carrier limitation.
The diversity of these proteins between humans and the natural reserve carriers of HCOVs, such as flying mice, single-curves and rodents, may constitute a barrier to intervising transmission.
In order to successfully transmit HCoV viruses, the dependency factors must be absorbed and the restraints of the carriers should be subject to.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be defined and categorized.
Good results can result in an impartial full-screening of the dependency and restrictions of carriers for SARS-CoV-2 through the latest CRISPR technology.
New HCV generation: back to zero mark
The variety of coronaviruses by flying mice provides a wide range of opportunities for new HCVs.
In this sense, the coronaviruses of flying mice serve as a genetic pulse for HCOV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also the driving force of HCOV and serve two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-encoded genes has the potential to radically modify virus phenotypes.
Of the SARS-CoV accessories, ORF8 is considered important for human adaptation, as viruses of flying mice, the SARS-CoV family, have been isolated, but it has been established that they encode the divergent ORF8.
In strains isolated from the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide detachment characterized by SARS-CoV coronaviruses was detected.
The delegation divided ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and considered it an adaptive mutation that accelerates the shift of carriers.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha- and gamma-consumer lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in the RNA-dependent RNA.
Recombination locations have also been identified in non-structural proteins nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.
In a similar way, the epidemic MERS-CoV was shown to have been recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in single-curved camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCVs in which HCOV was recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It is also necessary to warn that artificial selection can contribute to accidental changes in viral genes, which is likely to result from the release of the virus from the selected pressure, for example by the immune system of the carrier.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-size ORF4 in a prototype strain of HCV-229E due to a double-nucleotide delicacy.
While the intact open-ended ORF4 can be seen in mouse and vertebrae viruses related to HCV-229E, alphaquinavirus alpaca demonstrates a single nucleotide inlet, resulting in a frame movement.
Finally, the evolution of new HCOV is also due to the pressure of selection on their reservoirs.
In the case of a virus-flighted coronavirus infection, there were poorly expressed symptoms or lack of them, which refers to mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and flying mice.
It turns out that flying mice are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronary viruses.
For example, failure to activate a fire response in flying mice effectively reduces the pathology caused by coronary viruses.
In addition, the natural activity of cell killers in flying mice has been exacerbated by the imperceptible receptor of the natural cell killer NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of the major hypersensitivity complex of Class I.
Moreover, a high level of active oxygen, which is provided with high metabolic activity by flying mice, can suppress the coronavirus replication, while affecting the count of exoribanuclease, thus creating a selection pressure for the generation of strains of the virus, which are highly pathogenic when entering the new carrier.
More pathogenic strains of the coronavirus may also evolve as a result of recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt the carrier.
Thus, it is no coincidence that in the last twenty years, three new human coronary viruses have appeared.
Coronaviruses are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoirs, such as flying mice or camels.
They're certainly being replicated without causing a strong immune response to the carrier.
This is a secret to why we see imperceptible carriers and what causes serious cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly associated with hyperactivity of immune response and cytokine fever, with the more severe immune response, the more severe damage of the mild ones.
On the contrary, unsymptomatic carriers do not have an immune response to the coronavirus.
The same immune response strategy may have beneficial effects in treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
In flying mice, there is a particularly strong interferon response.
Thus, taking interferon type I at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should have an beneficial effect.
In addition, in flying mice, the activation of NLRP3-inflammasoma has been compromised.
Based on this inhibition of NLRP3-inflammasoma, MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The development of SARS-COV-2 is based on a general scheme of SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
While beta-coronavirus has been found in flying mice, with a 95 per cent match with SARS-CoV, there is also a coronavirus in flying mice, with a 96 per cent match with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that worms and other animals on the market carry viruses, identical SARS-CoVs, no direct intermediate carriers for SARS-CoV-2 have been established.
Pangolin beta-aviruses have been detected, strikingly homologous SARS-CoV-2, which says that the pangolins could serve as one of the intermediate carriers or that the fragments of the Pangolin beta-avirus genes could enter the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was designed or accidentally created by a human.
Coronaviruses have attracted general attention because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 explosion.
The study of coronaviruses in flying mice and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and HCOV animal reserves in human transmission.
Convinced evidence has shown that SARS-COV, MERS-COV and SARS-COV-2 come from flying mice and have been transmitted to a person through intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CoV infection occurs from contact between people and peat markets, the closure of the visa markets and the destruction of the peat could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the opening of the various lines of batacoronaviruses of pangolins near the SARS-CoV-2, it is necessary to remove pangolins in order to prevent zoonotic transmission of the infection from the product markets.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to a person through pangolines and other dairy products and how this can be done remains the task of future studies.
On the other hand, the Mers-CoV virus has long existed in single-curves.
These camels serve as an important vehicle, as well as the main source of meat, milk, leather and articles from the breast for the local population.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to sacrifice all camels for control of MERS, as was done in the Chinese wild animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
In order to stop the periodic outbreaks of MERS, an integrated approach should be taken to develop an effective MERS-CoV vaccine for females in conjunction with other measures of infectious control.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes can occur causing outbreaks of disease.
In the world, a variety of zoonotic coronaviruses are circulating.
In particular, there are a wide variety of coronaviruses of flying mice with zoonotic potential.
There is a huge number of possibilities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonotic coronaviruses, which will in future lead to new coronaviruses that are easier to transmit and/or more lethal to humans.
In order to reduce the number of extra contacts between humans and animals, the culture of use of wild animals in certain areas of China should be rejected.
Following severe tests such as SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plans are required.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until the possibility of taking up new territories arises.
While many properties of flying mice are beneficial for the spread of viruses, if you teach people to stay away from them, you can minimize the likelihood of human contact with flying mice and other wild animals.
To better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural carriers, permanent epidemiological surveillance of dairy animals is required, which will be useful to prevent the transmission of coronaviruses from animals and future outbreaks of diseases.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent virus zoonoses is to keep people away from the natural nests of zoonotic viruses.
Some fragments are still missing in the head of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First of all, if the flying mouse has been transmitted to the previous SARS-CoV-2 pangoline virus, it is interesting to see under what circumstances the flying mouse and pangoline divide the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if flying mice play a more direct role in human transmission, it is necessary to determine how people have come into contact with flying mice.
Thirdly, if a true intermediate carrier plays a third milking agent, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, flying mice and pangolins.
Finally, since many dairy animals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it is a flying mouse, a pangoline or another milking agent, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its predecessor viruses will be identified by their natural carriers.
Further studies in this area will shed light on the evolution path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Update of diagnostic criteria required for “inspection of disease” and “confirmed cases” of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our group published a brief background guide on the diagnosis and treatment of a new coronary infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information on our experience and recommendations to combat this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronary virus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of ongoing research and clinical experience; thus diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
In this letter, we have responded to one comment on our recommendations and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for “disease suspected” and “confirmed cases” in accordance with the document “Diagnostic and Therapy Recommendations for COVID-19” (seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the PRC.
In December 2019, a new coronary virus 2019 (2019-nCoV) was triggered, now officially known as coronary infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus itself was called “a severe acute respiratory syndrome 2” (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our group developed a brief background guide and published it on the Military Medical Research website on 6 February 2020.
This publication has brought great attention to itself.
Noting that COVID-19 is a new disease, our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of ongoing research and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
For example, from 16 January to 3 March 2020, seven editions of the document “Diagnostic and Therapy Recommendations for COVID-19”, published by the National Health Committee of the PRC (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), have changed the content of some of its provisions.
Recently, comments were made on our recommendations in the work prepared by Zhou, which contained simple diagnostic proposals based on already available clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations and has also provided valuable background information on this pandemic that covers the whole world.
We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our appreciation.
However, according to the latest issue of “Diagnostic and Therapy Recommendations for COVID-19” (test seventh version) and the results of ongoing studies, their work needs to be updated.
In accordance with the seventh issue of this document (since 3 March 2020) for a comprehensive analysis of the case of suspected disease, one element of the epidemiological history must be combined with two clinical manifestations of the disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) the history of movements or locations in and around Uhan and its surroundings or other human sites where cases of COVID-19 disease have been recorded within 14 days prior to symptoms; (2) the history of contacts with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test based on nucleic acid); (3) the history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Uhany and its surroundings or other human sites where cases of COVID-19 have been recorded during the last 14 days prior to symptoms; (4) the history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed diseases (≥ 2 cases with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Uhan and from other human sites, such as lysis or lysis, etc.
Clinical manifestations: (1) High temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) External manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (3) The total number of leukocytes is normal or reduced with a reduced number of lymphocytes during the early onset of symptoms.
The diagnosis of confirmed disease should be based on a suspected disease with one of the following pathogenetic or serological evidence, namely: (1) the real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the full sequence of the virus shows high homogeneity for new coronary viruses; (3) the positive results of serum tests for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies; or the change of the test result from positive for the IgG-specific SARS-CoV-2 antibody, or the increase of titres at least 4 times in the recovery phase for the relevant acute phase.
It can also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020) issues of the document, a real-time PCR test was added for nucleic acid in respiratory pathways or blood tests.
The pathogenetic diagnosis of the blood sample was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020) issues; then the seventh issue added the need for serological evidence.
These changes are based on the results of the continuous work of researchers looking for the optimal set of nucleic acid detection at rapid diagnosis, as well as on the analysis of samples taken from respiratory pathways, including blood sampling, which increases the availability of various samples and contributes to the inclusion of positive results for specific antibodies to the disease confirmation criteria.
However, there is increasing evidence of the need to be cautious in the treatment of patients with atypical symptoms and patients without express symptoms.
Thus, the road map presented in Zjou (Zhou) and others should be updated, since it lists persons with no clinical symptoms as a low-risk group.
The evaluation system also requires clarification in further clinical practices and studies.
In conclusion, we hope to obtain more direct evidence and call on readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “ suspicions of disease” and “confirmed cases”, we invite readers to follow up and follow closely the latest recommendations made in the countries where they live.
Our group will also update its recommendations in a timely manner to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths as a result of COVID-19, the daily maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 per day.
It's the largest number of deaths from the virus per day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Control and Disease Studies (IEDCR) reported that 114 cases were in progress as well as 33 hospitalized patients.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In the online briefing, director of IEDCR Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora said that four men and one woman had become victims.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, the two who had died were over 60 years of age, two between 51 and 60 years of age, and one between 41 and 50 years of age.
She also reported that two people were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
The clinic officer told the local news agency Annadolu that Jaal Saifur Rachman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, was one of the dead.
On Saturday, in an online video statement by the Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Bangladesh Owaydul Quader said that public transport would be terminated for a longer time than originally planned before the next Saturday.
Public transport was stopped on 26 March and was scheduled to resume on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of first-time goods — medicines, fuel and food products — has still been authorised.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection were recorded in Bangladesh on 8 March for two persons who returned from Italy and for one of them.
As of 19 March, these three people have already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 exceeded the millions of cases of infection worldwide
According to John Hopkins University, a quarter of the total number of cases of coronary infection SARS-CoV-2 worldwide has exceeded one million.
At least 52,000 people were killed by the COVID-19 coronavirus.
Russia took place on the same day that the first case of infection was confirmed in Malawi and the first case of coronary disease was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that as a Thursday it was one of the few countries where there were no cases of coronary infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases of infection, including 79,332 cases in twenty four hours preceding 10:00 per Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronary virus infection were recorded, of which at least 5,900 had a fatal outcome.
CBS News, referring to data from the University of Jones Hopkins, reported that more than 1,000 deaths caused by coronary infection had been reported in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced a strengthening of disease prevention measures.
On Thursday, the mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobjanin, extended the regime of self-insulation of the city by 1 May.
Earlier President Vladimir Putin said that Russia would receive a salary throughout the country, despite self-insulation, by 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted for an extension of the emergency for 15 days; the result of the vote was 215 votes “for”, ten abstentions and one against”.
Saudi Arabia extended the ordering time in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, while the previous ordering time lasted from only 3 hours to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to introduce a ten-hour ordering hour of dinner by 4 a.m.
The Governor of Ohio, Mike Dewein, announced that the regime of home self-insulation in the state was extended by order until 1 May.
Stores in Australia limit the number of packages of toilet paper to be purchased once
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian Woolworths and Coles stores reduced the number of toilet packages, which could be purchased once in all country stores, to two and one packages respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also imposed a restriction on one package.
These restrictions were reported in cash statements as well as on the Facebook website.
It is reported that citizens have begun making emergency stocks because of the assurance that the COVID-19 may lead to the introduction of a general self-insulation regime.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the quantity of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Earlier, 4 and 5 March respectively, Woolworths and Coles had already limited this number to 4 packages.
The Coles network, in its press release of 8 March, reported that with the introduction of four packages, “in many stores the toilet paper is still buying too fast, one delivery over an hour,” and called such a demand “unprecedented”, while ALDI in the Facebook post published on Tuesday called the trend “unawaited”.
According to the representative of Woolworths, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
Costco store in Canberra also limited the number of packages last week.
In order to meet the deficit, Coles ordered larger parties from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional parties, while ALDI made stocks for the special share of early sales on the environment.
Russell Cimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Association of Riddlers, reported that the Riddlers were trying to fill up stocks, but this was difficult because of local authorities ' restrictions on the timetable for the carriage of trucks.
It is expected to increase the cost of the product, as suppliers are trying to satisfy demand, but less and less favourable proposals are available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that some stores could not carry out environmental activities as a result of the disposal of stocks.
In the report News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert on retail trade at the Queensland University of Technology, said that stores fill the stores every night.
He noted that the toilet paper was a bulky product, so the quantity of warehouses was small, and after the sale of the entire product, long series of poles remained empty, increasing the sense of lack of stocks.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if the poles could be filled, and goods such as toilet paper rolls and hand disinfectants could be placed on these poles in large quantities, buyers would probably not panic,” says Russell Cimmerman.
In the past, the manufacturer of who gave a Crap processed toilet paper reported the end of the stocks.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, Kleenex and Solaris Paper, also producing Sorbent brand goods, reported that they are working round-the-clock to ensure sufficient quantity of goods.
Domain.com, a real estate sales site, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne declined due to the absence of buyers on the weekday of the Work Day, some real estate sellers began offering the first participants free toilet paper.
The fourth daily issue of NT News, printed in Darwin, included an eight-page tab for cutting and use as a toilet paper.
According to the ABC Australia report of 3 March, the shops were initially reluctant to impose restrictions on the quantity of goods purchased, claiming that they were not planning to do so.
Russell Cimmerman added that other products also benefit from increased demand, including medical masks, hand disinfectants, gallantry, handwashing and torture.
Similarly, in addition to the events in Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that the online store of the UK supermarket Ocado also limited the sale of the Andres toilet paper with two packs of 12 roulettes.
The World Health Organization announces the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the pandemic of COVID-19, caused by coronvirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the term “Pandemia” refers only to the extent of the disease, rather than to the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that Governments must take measures:
“All countries are still in a position to influence the development of the pandemic.”
This is possible if countries are to identify, test, treat, isolate the sick, track the occurrence of the disease, and mobilize their citizens,” explained WHO Director-General, Mr. Tedros Adana Gebreísus.
“We are deeply concerned about both the worrying level of spread and severity of the disease and the worrying level of inactivity.”
According to Dr. Tom Friden, former director of the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented”.
In his interview with CNN in February, he said that “no respiratory virus other than influenza has been traced since its emergence to continuous global distribution”.
Mr. Gabrielus expressed a similar view, he said that “we have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronary virus.
We have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before."
First, in January, WHO announced the outbreak of this state of emergency in the area of public health, which is of international importance and then granted it a new status — pandemic.
The Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infections of the United States, Dr. Anthony Faci, responded by saying, “This is only the beginning, it will continue to be worse”.
According to the Associated Press, at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases were registered on Thursday, with more than 4,600 deaths.
Pandemy of Coronavirus 2019-2020 is currently a pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a severe severe respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-COV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Uhana, China, in December 2019, and the emergency situation of international public health was announced on 30 January 2020, which was subsequently recognized by the pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were registered in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
China's mortality rate is 4 per cent, while the world varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include nausea, cough and difficulty breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and severe respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from the first onset of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also range from two to fourteen days.
No vaccine or specific treatment is currently available.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive; the recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the lips with cough, keeping the distance between people, identifying and ensuring self-insulating people suspected of infection.
Authorities around the world have responded to the situation by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, command clocks, workplace risk control and closures.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic consequences, transfer or abolition of sports, religious, political and cultural activities, as well as a widespread lack of goods exacerbated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities were closed at national or regional levels in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world ' s students.
The Internet began to spread viral disinformation, xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other East and South-East Asian citizens, or people who recalled them externally, as well as other groups of people living in areas where significant cases of viral proliferation were noted.
The reduction in the number of travel and closures of heavy-duty industries has reduced the level of air pollution and carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities of Uhanh (Chairman of the Province of Hubei), China, reported the occurrence of pneumonia for an unknown reason and an investigation of the situation was initiated in early January 2020.
Infectious cases were mainly related to the common market for Juanan marine products, so the virus is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus caused by the outbreak of the disease is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a recently-opened virus that is very similar to mouse-flighted coronary viruses, pangoline coronary viruses and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first case of the disease occurred on 1 December 2019 and that the infected person did not visit the market after that date.
Two thirds of the infections registered in December 2019 were related to this market.
On 13 March 2020, the publication of the Southern Chinese office of Morning Post, whose information was not verified, suggested that the first case of infection occurred with the 55-year-old resident of the province of Hubey on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020 WHO reported that the number of new infections in China had decreased but suddenly grew in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new infections outside China for the first time exceeded the number of new cases of infection in China itself.
The number of cases of the disease may be significantly reduced, in particular due to the number of cases with poorly-expressed symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases of infection were reported among young people, with patients 19 years of age and younger, accounting for less than 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide.
Statistics include cases of infection of people who have been checked for COVID-19 and whose test has been positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, an official policy was adopted that did not require testing for only minor symptoms.
The study published on 16 March showed that up to 23 January China had not detected 86 per cent of the COVID-19 infection and that such unregistered diseases had become a source of infection for 79 per cent of the reported cases.
The statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of cases of actual infection in Italy was significantly higher than the number of cases recorded.
The initial estimates of the baseline reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that this figure may be 5.7.
Most COVID-19 patients are well cured.
In other more complex cases, the time from the onset of symptoms to the moment of death was between 6 and 41 days, the most frequent period of 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, approximately 80 per cent of deaths occurred in persons over 60 years of age and 75 per cent of those who died from side diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official data on mortality from the COVID-19 pandemic usually include data on deaths of patients with positive results of COVID testing performed under official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not take into account dead people who have not been tested, for example in the case of death at home, in the homes of the elderly, etc.
The incomplete data on Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official data on COVID at 4-5 times.
The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Press Secretary recognizes: “We know that [the reported number of deaths] is less factual.” His words are confirmed by reports of some single cases in the U.S., and such incomplete data are often found in pandemics such as the H1N1 2009 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was registered in Uganda on 9 January 2020.
The first death was registered in the Philippines on 1 February outside of mainland China and in France on 14 February.
By 28 February, more than ten deaths had been recorded outside of China: in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and regions in all continents, except Antarctica, reported deaths; several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All indicators vary depending on the region and the time of spread of the disease; they also affect the levels of testing, the quality of the health systems used in the treatment scheme, the time since the outbreak of the disease and the population parameters, such as age, sex and overall health status.
According to statistics from Jones Hopkins University, as at 10 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204).
Data vary from region to region.
In China, the mortality rate for the disease was reduced from 17.3% (for those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms since 1 February 2020). Other methods include the percentage of death caused by the disease (CFR) - the percentage of diagnosed patients dying from the disease and the percentage of death from the infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) patients dying from the disease.
These statistics do not relate to a specific time period and reflect the indicators of certain populations from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these indicators by specific groups of people.
According to the Oxford University Medical Evidence Centre, the mortality rate from this pandemic is generally 0.1 to 0.39%.
The upper figure of this range is consistent with the results of the first random test on COVID-19 in Germany, as well as with a statistical study analysing the impact of the test on the CFR assessment.
WHO argues that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and exact length of the blast shall not be determined and may vary depending on the location.
Matya Bonnie, a member of the University of Pennsylvania, claims that “uncontrolled outbreaks usually occur on the plate, and then when the number of available carriers of the disease is over, they begin to disappear.
However, in the current situation, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable predictions as to when this will happen.”
The Senior Medical Adviser of the Chinese Government, Jjun Nanishan, argues that “all can end by June”, if all countries can mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on the cessation of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 would “circulate perhaps within a year or two”.
According to a study conducted by the Imperial College under the guidance of Neil Ferguson, “until a vaccine is established (possible, 18 months or more)”, it will be necessary to comply with physical distance and other measures.
William Schaffner, a member of the University of Vanderbilt, believes: “I don’t think this coronavirus will ever disappear at all, because it is so easily transmitted,” and that it “can become a seasonal disease, burning every year.”
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms may be relatively non-specific, and some infected people may experience a disease without symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are fever (88 per cent) and dry cough (68 per cent).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, wetting in respiratory pathways (slips), loss of redness, swelling, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, swelling, redness, blood clots, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO claims to be seriously ill with the development of respiratory problems about every six persons.
The U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list urgent symptoms such as difficulty in breathing, persistent chest pain or feeling suffocated, sudden feeling of unconsciousness, difficulty in awakening and sweating of the person or loss. If these symptoms are present, medical attention should be sought immediately. Further development of the disease may lead to severe pneumonia, severe respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, sepsis, septic shock and death.
In some infected people, the disease may occur in some cases without any clinical signs, but the results of the analysis confirm the infection, and doctors recommend that individuals in close contact with patients whose diagnosis is confirmed should be carefully monitored and examined for infection.
According to Chinese scientists, the number of cases of unsymptomatic flow of the disease varies from several units to 44 per cent of all cases.
The usual incubation period (time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; usually it is five days; there is no complete clarity about the symptoms of discolouration: the initial estimates were that the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed the symptom was 30 per cent and then decreased to 15 per cent.
Some details on the methods of spreading the disease are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is transmitted mainly during close contact, as well as through small air droplets with cough, cough or conversation; close contact means contact within 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, the caps may range from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
There are assumptions that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops emitted in the air during a conversation that can remain in the air for a longer time. Respiratory drops can also be formed in the air, including during the conversation, although the virus is usually not carried through the air.
The chapels can fall into the mouth or nose of some people, as well as into the light.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular resuscitation (SDRs), may lead to the spread of respiratory products and therefore to the spread of the virus in the air.
It may also penetrate the body if it concerns the contaminated surface, including the skin, with a subsequent touch to its eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus can be transmitted through faecality, but the risk of this method of transmission is considered low.
The Government of China denies the possibility of a fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus was most infected within the first three days of the onset of symptoms, although its spread may occur both before the onset of symptoms and at later stages of the disease.
There have been cases of positive tests in three days prior to onset of symptoms, and this refers to the possibility of transmission of the virus prior to an express onset of symptoms.
There are only a few reports of laboratoryly confirmed cases of unsymptomatic flow of the disease, but some countries have also identified cases of transmission of the disease from unsymptomatic carriers.
Officials of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) claim that until it is quite clear how easily the virus is spread, however, it is known that one patient is usually infected with 2-3 other people.
In particular, it was found that on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on a stainless steel (304), the virus is able to live up to three days, on a cardboard surface for one day, and on a slow surface for up to 4 hours.
This data, however, varies depending on humidity and temperature. Domestic and other animals received a positive result for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit a virus to humans, although the British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, just as, for example, after contact with other surfaces to which infected people could be attached.
The severe acute coronary syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus that was first detected in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhana.
All of the signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the nature of the coronal virus. The virus can be destroyed outside the human body by means of a home mill that dissolves its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the original SARS-CoV virus.
It's supposed to be of zoonotic origin.
The genetic analysis of coronavirus showed that it is genetically classified with the genus Betacoronavirus, the genus Sarbecovirus (cell line B) together with two other strains of flying mice.
At the global level, it is 96% identical to other models of mouse coronavirus (BatCov RatG13).
In February 2020, the Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the sequences of pangoline and human viruses.
The whole- know-how comparison to date has shown that the highest rate of similarity (92 per cent) exists between the pangoline coronary virus and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that the pangolins are intermediate masters of the virus.
Virus infection may be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although ultimately it should be confirmed by an analysis of a polymeric chain reaction with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) of the infected secret or computer tomography.
The results of the study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Uhana showed that CT was much more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, since many of its visualization functions coincide with other pneumonias and disease flow processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation “not to use CT for boxing or as a first-line test method in the COVID-19 diagnosis”.
WHO published several RNA testing protocols at SARS-CoV-2, and the first was published on 17 January.
A real-time polymeric chain reaction test (RT-PCR) shall be conducted.
It can be carried out on breath samples and blood samples.
The results are usually prepared for a period of several hours to a few days.
The test is usually used for the bone marrow, although it can also be used from the neck. A number of laboratories and companies develop serological tests to detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of them proved accurate enough to obtain a universal approval.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The characteristics of visualization of the symptoms on X-rays and computer tomography (CT) include asymmetric peripheral mutations of the type of mammary glass and lack of pleural discharges.
The Italian Radiological Society is involved in the drawing up of the international database of confirmed cases of infection.
Because of other infections, such as adenvirus, with the identification of COPID-19 images not confirmed by PCR tests, have a limited clinical specification.
China had conducted a large study comparing the results of the CTC of the breast cell and the PCR testing, and it was found that, although the photos were less specific in the case of infection, they could be decrypted faster; they were also more sensitive, and therefore this diagnostic method could be considered as a screening tool in infected areas.
In order to diagnose the virus using X-rays and computer tomography, the virtual nerve networks were developed based on artificial intelligence.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include the maintenance of general personal hygiene, washing of hands, avoiding eye, nose or mouth contact with dirty hands, use in coughing or spleening, which should be discarded immediately after use.
Those who may already have been infected should wear a medical mask in public places.
Many Governments recommend refraining from any untimely trip to countries and areas affected by outbreaks and restricting the movement of citizens.
However, the virus could spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is distributed among the population, some of which do not know where or how they were infected. Medical workers who care for patients who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions, as well as precautions in contact with other people and the means to protect their eyes.
The use by Governments of data on the location of citizens through their mobile phones has raised concerns about confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International (International Amnesty), as well as more than 100 other organizations, have made statements requiring that this type of monitoring be restricted.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use have been developed and proposed; as of 7 April 2020, more than ten expert groups have been working on the development of personal data-confidential solutions, such as user-friendly registration of other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If the mobile phone user is in close contact with a person whose test for COVID-19 has been positive, he will receive the relevant notification. There are also unwarranted versions of how to prevent infection, such as nose and mouth swelling, which is actually ineffective.
There is currently no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working on its establishment.
To prevent the spread of the disease, hand washing is recommended.
CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends more frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after a visit to the toilet or during severe hand pollution, as well as before eating, after swallowing, coughing or sneezing.
This is necessary because, when the virus is outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by a home mill that conceals its protective cover.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, CDC recommends that disinfectants be used to treat alcohol-based hands with at least 60 per cent of alcohol content.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands.
The surfaces may be disinfected by a number of solutions (on the surface of the stainless steel disinfectant begins to work a minute after administration) containing 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% pervidone iodine.
Other components, such as benzene chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that in the event of suspicion of COPID or its confirmation in the establishment, such as office or day-to-day station, all spaces such as cabinets, toilets, general facilities, electronic equipment, such as boards, sensor screens, keyboards, remote control gates and ATMs used by sick persons be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose of the back of the rag or of the walnut and immediately removing the items used in the hygiene.
Those who may have been infected are recommended to use medical masks, as the use of masks may limit the volume and extent of the spread of the extracts that are scattered in the air when talking, squeezing and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virusologist at the University of Lids, “the use of a medical mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces, and the attachment to the face of dirty hands is the main means of infection.” The masks are also recommended for the use of those who protect against people who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, for example, for persons who are wearing a man with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of masks actually reduces the number of person-to-person injuries.
Several countries began calling for the use of medical masks in public places.
The CDC centres, the United States, recommend wearing non-medical facial masks. China has separately stressed the importance of using single-time medical masks for healthy people, especially if they are in close contact with other people (1 meters (3 feet) or less).
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or in public places.
Health officials in Thailand call on people to make personal tissue masks in their home environment and to take care of them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from entering the street without masks closing their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, the Government of Viet Nam requested all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Government of Austria has committed all visitors to food stores to wear medical masks.
The Government of Israel also requested citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, in Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks are made from mid-March, it was prescribed to use medical masks for all passengers on buses and international buses.
In Panama, residents are obliged to wear a medical mask on their way out; those who cannot afford to wear masks are recommended to wear them on their own in domestic circumstances.
Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is an anti-infection measure aimed at reducing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can use social distance measures, staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding public places, using contactless greetings and physically away from others.
Many Governments of the regions, especially those affected by the outbreak, are currently prescribing or recommending social exclusion.
The maximum number of people who could be gathered in one place, as recommended by the United States Government and health organizations, was rapidly reduced from 250 (in regions where no data on the prevalence of COVID-19) to 50 and later to 10 (in areas where no data were available).
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the presence of a group of more than two persons: elderly people and persons suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and a weakened immune system, with increased risk of serious virus disease. The CDC recommends them to stay at home as long as possible if there is an outbreak of the disease in the region. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began to replace the term “social distance” with “physical distance” thus clarifying the objective of this measure – to reduce physical contact within social relations, whether by virtual or physical distance.
The use of the term “social distance” was understood to mean that people should be subjected to full social isolation rather than to stay in touch with other people in alternative ways. Some authorities published guidelines on sexual health that should be used during the pandemic.
Among other things, recommendations were made to engage in sexual intercourse only with your permanent partners with whom you live, and in whom you are confident that he does not have the virus and its symptoms.
Persons diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected are recommended for self-insulation in domestic conditions.
Health institutions have published detailed instructions on proper self-exclusion, and many Governments have also made mandatory or recommended that the entire population of affected areas be placed in quarantine.
The strictest quarantine was prescribed for people in high-risk groups.
Persons who may have been in contact with infected COVID-19 or recently visited a country or region, to a significant extent affected by the epidemic, have been recommended to find quarantine for 14 days since the last possible contact.
The strategies for combating outbreaks include curbing the spread of the disease, suppression or mitigation.
The prevention of the spread of the disease is carried out at an early stage and aims to track and isolate the infected, as well as other measures of infectious control and vaccination to stop the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.
At a stage where the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made to mitigate the impact: measures are being taken to reduce the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on health and society.
Measures to prevent and mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease may be taken at the same time.
The impact of the infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of cases of infection to levels 1 below. Part of the efforts to manage the outbreak of the infectious disease is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic, known as the equation of the epidemic curve.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overload of health services and provide more time for the development of vaccines and treatment methods.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help to cope with outbreaks include measures of personal prevention, such as hygiene, the use of medical masks and self-insulation; public measures aimed at physical remoteization, such as the closure of schools and the abolition of mass activities; community involvement in the promotion and participation of such measures; and measures to protect the environment, such as surface cleaning.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, mass screening and localized quarantine were introduced, as well as an alert system for the movement of infected persons.
In Singapore, they provided financial support to those infected with self-insulation and imposed large fines on those who did not.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks and drug surpluses increased, and the modeling of Britain and the United States showed that there were serious problems with mitigation (a slow but not a halt to the spread of the epidemic) and depression (a halt to the growth of the epidemic).
The optimal policy to mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease can reduce the peak burden on the health system by 2/3, while mortality is twice, but still leads to hundreds of thousands of deaths and collapse of health systems.
Pressure may be a preferred method, but it must be used until the virus circulates among the population (or until the vaccine is developed if it occurs earlier), because otherwise the spread of the disease will resume rapidly when the measures are weakened.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic leads to social and economic costs.
There are currently no anti-virus medicines approved to treat COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking unreceptive medicines from colds, drinking sufficient fluids and rest can help to relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the patient's disease, oxygen therapy, internal fluidization and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids can only be harmful.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also reported that some “traditional and household means” could facilitate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO considers capacity-building and health adaptation to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a major response to the outbreak of the disease.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the Regional Bureau of WHO issued guidelines for primary health care clinics and services to assist in the redeployment of resources at several levels, including the concentration of laboratory services for the testing of COVID-19, the elimination of non-term procedures, where possible, the detection of the virus and isolation of patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, and the enhancement of the capacity of intensive therapy by training staff and increasing the number of available devices for HIV and cocaine.
There are different theories about where the first case of infection could occur — the so-called “zero patient”.
The first known case of a new coronary infection was probably in the city of Uhan Province of Hubei, China, on 1 December 2019.
During the month, the number of cases of coronary virus infection in the province of Hubei has increased gradually.
They were mainly related to the general market of the Juanaan marine products, which were also sold to live animals, and one theory was that the virus penetrated into the human body from one of those animals; in other words, the virus had a zoonotic origin. On 26 December, a case of mass pneumonia of unknown origin was registered at the Hubaji province clinic, with which Dr. Zjan Tianzzin was working, and on 27 December, reporting the case to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the City of Uhanan.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at the Uhani Central Clinic warned their colleagues about “coronavirus similar to SARS”.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenjan, were warned by the police about the responsibility for spreading false rumors, and the doctor, Ih Fen, received an excuse from his superiors for panicking.
Later, on 31 December, the Uhanya Municipal Health Commission published a public notice and informed WHO about the situation.
The Ugandan health authorities reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which was large enough to initiate an investigation in early January. At the early stages, the number of cases was doubled by about seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread in other Chinese provinces, which was promoted by Chinese New Year's holidays and the fact that Uhan was a transport and main railway bridge.
On 20 January China reported 140 new cases of infection in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
As of 26 March, the United States seized China and Italy on the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases of infection were reported worldwide, more than 97,000 people were killed, and more 364,000 people were killed.
Some 200 countries and territories have registered at least one registered infection.
Because of the pandemic, many European countries in the Schengen area have restricted their free movement and established border controls.
National response measures included measures to prevent the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as compulsory residence, mandatory shelter or isolation), as well as the time of command. As of 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population of the United States, were in some form quarantine, more than 50 million people were in the Philippines, about 59 million people were in isolation in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people were in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were isolated, and within two days the figure increased to 2.6 billion — about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Uhana on 1 December 2019; the second record shows that the reliability of the information was not verified, that date was 17 November.
On 26 December, Dr. Zhan Zisan worked with the case of an unknown type of pneumonia, which her clinic reported on 27 December to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Xianhan in the city of Uhan.
The primary genetic test of patients on 27 December 2019 showed the presence of the SARS-like coronary virus.
On 31 December, the Uhanya Municipal Health Commission issued the relevant public notice.
WHO was notified that same day.
As a result of such notifications, the police warned doctors in Uhana about the responsibility for the “dissemination of rumors” of explosions.
Initially, the Chinese National Health Commission claimed that there was no “clear evidence” of the re-detected virus ' s ability to transmit from human to human.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a radical campaign to prevent the spread of the virus, which was later called the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party, Si Xinpin, a “national war”.
The events of “the largest quarantine in the history of humanity” began on 23 January with the announcement of a Sanitary Border and the ban on entry into and return to the Uhan, followed by a total of 15 cities in the province of Hubai and a total of about 57 million people.
In the city, the use of personal transport was prohibited.
Celebrations on the occasion of China's New Year (25 January) have been cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital in Huosinšan, which was completed within 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital, Laishchan, was built, which was taken by other incoming patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has also redesigned 14 other agencies in Uganda, such as conference centres and stadiums, in temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government has taken additional measures to curb the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issuance of health reports for travellers and the extension of the Chinese New Year's celebration.
Universities and schools were closed all over the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions, the Chinese authorities have introduced a remote working regime.
Travel restrictions were imposed in the province of Hubei and beyond.
The timetable for public transport was changed and the museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
In many cities, citizens' movement control regime was introduced, and it was estimated that some 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some form of restrictions on open air movement. Following the outbreak in the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the “import” of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing had a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. As of 23 March, only one case of transmission of the infection within the country, which occurred five days before, was registered in this case by a man who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, China's Prime Minister Li Caitán reported that the spread of diseases transmitted within the country was largely halted and the outbreak in China was monitored.
On the same day, travel restrictions were lifted in Cuba, except for Uhanya, two months after the quarantine closure. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that from 28 March the entry of visas or residence permits would be suspended.
Those wishing to come to China will have to apply for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
On 30 March, the Chinese Government called on businesses and factories to resume their work and to provide companies with a package of money-stimulation measures. On 4 April 10 a.m., a national “minute of silence” was held, which was a day of mourning for the victims of the coronary virus, announced by the State Council of the country and coincided with the Feast of Quinmin, but the Central Government asked citizens to pay tribute to the deceased online, respecting physical distance to avoid the recurrence of the cry of COVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 had spread from China to South Korea on 20 January 2020.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases of disease, many of which occurred because of the high number of followers of the new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shinchhonji.
The followers of Shinchhonji came to Tegu from Uhanya, which is probably a source of blast.
As of 22 February, of the 9,336 followers of the church 1,261 (approximately 13 per cent) reported that they had symptoms of disease. On 23 February 2020, the highest level of concern was announced in South Korea.
More than 2,000 confirmed cases of infection were registered in Korea on 28 February and the rate increased to 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases have been placed on quarantine after the three soldiers have reportedly confirmed the presence of the virus.
The explosion had an impact on the number of trips, so the flight schedule had been changed; South Korea had launched a population-wide screening programme for the presence of a virus, tracking of contacts and quarantine measures for contact persons, which was considered to be the world's largest and best-known organization.
The screening methods included mandatory reporting of their symptoms through a mobile application to all who came from abroad, primary virus testing, the results of which have been prepared for the next day, as well as increased testing capabilities that allowed up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
South Korea's programme is considered successful in combating the outbreak of the disease, despite the fact that it has not been able to isolate entire cities.
Many Koreans have signed petitions that have either commended the President ' s actions or called on Mr. Moon to give the impression that the Government ' s response to the outbreak of the disease was inadequate.
On 23 March, it was reported that the lowest total number of infections per day was recorded in South Korea for four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that from 1 April, all newly arrived outside the border would be placed on a two-week quarantine.
According to media reports, on 1 April South Korea was assisted by a virus test in 121 countries.
On 19 February, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Kuma, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people ended later that day.
The first measures introduced by the Government included the abolition of concerts and other cultural and sporting activities, Friday prayer, and the closure of universities, higher education and schools.
Iran has distributed five trillion rials to combat the virus.
President Hassan Ruhani stated on 26 February 2020 that the Government did not intend to impose quarantine on entire areas affected by the blast, but only individuals would be placed on quarantine.
In March, plans to limit international travel were announced, but the intensive movement between cities prior to the New Year continued.
The Shiite festivals in Kuma remained open to the Palamians until 16 March 2020. Iran became the centre for the spread of the virus after China in February.
In the light of the statements on the scope of the outbreak in Iran, more than 10 countries linked the occurrence of the outbreak with Iran by 28 February, indicating that the extent of the outbreak there may be more serious than 388 cases registered by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iran parliament was closed, and 23 of its 290 members reported on 3 March had positive results for the virus.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch called on Iran ' s prison management to release human rights defenders detained for peaceful inconsistency, and to temporarily release all prisoners belonging to this category.
The organization claims that there is an increased risk of the spread of the virus in closed facilities, such as prisons where adequate medical care is lacking.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths during one day — the largest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak.
By 17 March, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died.
By 23 March, 50 new cases of coronary disease were reported every hour in Iran, and every ten minutes, one new death from the coronary virus.
According to a WHO representative, the level of disease in Iran may be five times higher than that reported at the official level.
The United States sanctions against Iran are also expected to affect the country ' s financial capacity to protect against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has required a reduction in economic sanctions for the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, it was confirmed that the disease had fallen on the territory of Italy when two Chinese tourists tested SARS-CoV-2 in Rome had a positive result.
The number of cases of infection has grown rapidly, which has prompted the Italian Government to suspend all flights to China and China and to declare an emergency.
Later, an unassociated COVID-19 infection cluster was found, beginning with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree on banning the outbreak, whereby more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were placed in quarantine.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: “The entry and exit of the disease will be closed.
In these areas, it has already been ordered to suspend the work of enterprises and to abolish sports activities." On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered all schools and universities throughout the country, as 100 people had already been killed in Italy.
All major sporting events, including the A series football matches, were to be held by the closed doors before April, but on 9 March all sporting events were postponed for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered that almost all commercial activities be suspended and that businesses be closed with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies.

As of 5 April, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases of coronary virus infection, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cases of recovery, most of which were concentrated in the Lombardy region.
One of the CNN reports noted that such a high level of mortality in Italy could contribute to the combination of two factors, a large number of older citizens in that country and the lack of access to all those who are more than the crown virus to date.
The United Kingdom responded to the virus most peacefully from all affected countries, and by 18 March 2020 the British Government did not oblige citizens to comply with any form of social distance or quarantine measures.
On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement recommending refraining from all trips and social contacts that are not of primary importance, offering people the opportunity to work from home and avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment facilities, such as pubs and sports clubs, should be closed as soon as possible and promised to pay up to 80 per cent of the salary, but not more than 2,500 pounds per month as a support measure for the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more stringent measures on social distance, prohibiting the gathering of more than two people and limiting the travel and active rest of the air to extreme needs.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were imposed by involving the police, the imposition of fines and the destruction of human graves.
Most enterprises were ordered to close, with the exception of enterprises that provide “life-saving”, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, business shops, car parking stations and garages.

Nevertheless, the testing of the population in the United States was not started immediately, and the true extent of the outbreak of the disease during that period was hidden.
The test was difficult because of the marriage of the test kits issued by the Federal Government in February, the absence of a federal authorization to use the non-State test kits developed by scientific organizations, different companies and clinics, and the restrictive criteria before the beginning of March, which would allow citizens to pass the test (this could only be done by appointment of the treating physician).

WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and prevent the spread of infection.
WHO noted the clear differences between the situation with the outbreak of atypical pneumonia in 2002-2004, in which the Chinese authorities had been accused of concealing information that it had allegedly prevented the prevention and prevention of its spread, on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the Central Government “supply provided updated information on the situation in order to avoid the panics of China’s New Year”.
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to introduce a ban on the movement of transport in Uhana, WHO representative of the Year of Galea noted that, although “this measure was definitely not recommended by WHO”, it was also “an important confirmation of the implementation of an epidemic prevention obligation in the most widespread place” and called it “unprecedented in public health history”. On 30 January, after confirming the ability to transmit the infection from a person outside China and the increase in the number of people infected in other countries, WHO announced an emergency situation in the public health system of international importance (PHEIC); this situation became the sixth since 2009, when this measure was first applied during the swine influenza pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adana, stated that the announcement of PHEIC was due to “the risk of global proliferation, especially in low- and middle-income countries with no reliable health systems.
Commenting on the restrictions on travel, Mr. Tedros said that “there are no reasons for measures that unduly impede international movements and trade”, and that “WHO does not recommend limiting trade and movement”.
On 5 February, WHO requested the world community to allocate US$ 675 million to provide strategic preparedness for the low-income epidemic, reporting the need to provide urgent assistance to those countries that “do not have systems to identify people infected with the virus, despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached those countries”.
Mr. Tedros also stated that “the measure of our readiness is the degree of readiness for the epidemic of our weakest calling”, and urged the international community to “make a choice: invest today or pay in the future”. At the press conference held on 11 February, WHO established the official name of the disease — COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterrish agreed to provide “the full potential of the UN system in response to the problem”.
As a result, the United Nations Crisis Management Unit was set up to coordinate all United Nations responses; these steps, as WHO states, will “concentrate on health responses, while other agencies can use their experience to combat the outbreak of disease in a broader social and economic context”.
On 14 February, WHO and China launched a joint special group to provide the work of international experts and WHO field staff in China to assist in resolving the situation in China and to evaluate “serious disease and its vulnerability”, organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, as well as field visits to assess “the effectiveness of response measures at the level of the provinces and districts, including urban and rural areas”. On 25 February, WHO stated that “the world must do more to prepare for the potential pandemic of the coronary virus, noting that “it is too early to call this pandemic, but countries must be ready for it”.
On 28 February, as the outbreak broke out in Iran, WHO sent a joint team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the likelihood of global spread of coronary virus would be increased by “high” to “high” high, the highest level of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, the Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Programme, warned in his statement: “This is a review of every government on the planet to be prepared for the real situation: time to work.
This virus may already be on its way to your country, and you need to be ready," and stressed that the right response can help the world avoid “the worst scenario of developments”.
Ryan also stated that current data did not serve as a basis for the proclamation of the global pandemic by official public health representatives, and added that the proclamation of the pandemic would mean that “we are in fact recognizing the fact that everyone on the planet will be at risk of being infected with the virus”.
On 11 March, the WHO announced the outbreak of the pandemic coronary virus.
The Director-General of WHO stated that WHO was “deeply concerned about both the alarming high levels of spread and severity of the disease and at least the alarming levels of inaction in this regard”. WHO was severely criticised for an inadequate approach to the concept of the pandemic, including the subsequent announcement of an emergency in public health and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
As a response to the situation in question to the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanyam, a request was made to resign, which was signed by 733,000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN experts on human rights stressed the importance of respect for the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Expert Group stated that everyone had the right to apply to him life-saving measures and that the Government was responsible for the organization of such measures.
The Panel stressed that the lack of resources or medical insurance should not at all justify discrimination against a particular group of people.
The experts emphasized that everyone has the right to health, including persons with limited capacity, representatives of minority groups, elderly citizens, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, persons living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners as well as refugees and other disadvantaged groups in need of State support.
International government organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has established a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on response policies in countries around the world, as well as to familiarize with views and recommendations.
The National Policy Tracker contains information on the country policy measures to strengthen health and world economy systems, eliminate the effects of quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and promote coordinated global responses to the fight against coronvirus.
The Government of China has been criticised by the United States, British Cabinet Minister Michael Gowa and Edward Bolsonar, son of President Jaira Bolsonar of Brazil, for actions to combat the pandemic that began with the Chinese province of Hubby.
A number of heads of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) levels were fired for the quarantine measures they had taken in central China, and these discharges showed a lack of accountability for the political deployment of these regions.
Some commentators believe that this step was aimed at protecting the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party of Si Xinpin from public anger about the outbreak of the coronary virus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zjoo Lizzyan, disagreed with the earlier statement that the blast of the crown virus had begun in Uhana, but took the side of the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 had emerged in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. Presidential Administration, Donald Trampa, called the crown virus “Chinese virus” or “Uhanya virus”, saying that “Censorship in China only exacerbates the situation with the virus that has now become a global pandemic”, and that statement was in turn criticized by some commentators who claim that such an approach is racist and “deprives the US President’s administration of preventing the spread of disease”.
The Daily Beast has had access to the U.S. Government telegram, which contains communication strategic skills, apparently invented by the National Security Council, with the following references to the strategy: “All things in China.
We are asked to disseminate this information in any way possible, including press conferences and television presentations." Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg stated that China's efforts to provide assistance to countries suffering from the virus are part of the “propaganist effort” to gain global influence.
The head of the EU foreign policy department, Joseph Borrell, warned of the presence of a “geopolitical component that includes the fight against the influence of the pirate and so-called generosity policy”.
Borrell also stated that “China is constantly advancing the idea of its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States”.
China also called upon the United States to abolish sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, with some information being provided in the last two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 Cuban medical masks was banned in connection with US sanctions imposed on 3 April.
The United States authorities are also accused of transferring assistance to their own country.
There were also disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has allocated hundreds of HlV devices for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian Government criticised the lack of support from the European Union for the coronavirus of Italy.
Mauricio Massari, the EU's Italian Ambassador, said that "China only reacted bilaterally.
This certainly does not show European solidarity.”
On 22 March, following a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin organized a shipment of Russian military sanitaries, specialized disinfection and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cites an anonymous “high-level political source”, claiming that 80 per cent of Russian assistance was “useless or of little use for Italy”.
The source accused Russia of seeking to make a favourable impression on the world public at the “geopolitical and diplomatic” level.
President of Lombardy Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Mayo rejected media attacks and thanked for the assistance.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
Press Secretary Kremlin Dmitri Peskov said that “by offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] suggests that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase production rates, they can also provide response if necessary”.
NATO Defence 2020, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, the largest NATO military training after the end of the cold war, will be carried out in a reduced format.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticised Defender 2020 (Protector 2020): “In the crisis that has been in the field of public health today, these studies pose a threat not only to the lives of the US military and many European participating countries, but also to the citizens of countries where such activities are to be carried out.” The Government of Iran has been severely affected by the virus. About two dozen members of Parliament have been infected, as well as fifteen other present or former political actors.
On 14 March 2020, President Hasan Ruhani, in an open letter, addressed the world leaders with a request for assistance, saying that his country has difficulty in combating the epidemic due to the lack of access to international markets due to sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran. The epidemic has called upon the United States to adopt social policies distributed in other states, including the introduction of a single health and childcare system, paid family leave and increased public health funding.
Politologists expected that this could have a negative impact on Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential elections.
South Korea criticised “unique and passive quarantine measures” in Japan after Japan announced that any citizen who arrived from South Korea would be placed on a two-week quarantine site in the places specifically designated by the Government.
South Korean society was originally divided by the reaction of President Mun Zhe-in to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions that have either commended the President's actions or called upon Mr. Moon to give the impression that the Government's response to the outbreak of the disease was inadequate, and the pandemic has forced countries to adopt emergency legislation as a response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this step would enable Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, Parliament voted in favour of granting Prime Minister Viktor Orban the unlimited right to manage by order, suspend Parliament's work, hold elections, and punish those who would be accused of spreading faecal information about the virus and governmental measures to combat the crisis.
The blast of the coronary virus was called the cause of several cases of supply shortages due to the global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the accumulation of panic products and the collapse of productive and logistical operations.
The U.S. Administration for Food Quality Control has issued warnings about the lack of medicines and medical equipment, resulting in increased consumer demand and reductions in suppliers.
There were also panic shopping in several human settlements; this led to a situation where the first necessary items, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, had disappeared from stores.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director General, Mr. Tedros Adanam, the demand for individual protection increased 100 times.
This leap led to a 20-fold increase in prices compared to the usual price, as well as delays in delivery of medical supplies for a period of four to six months.
He also called for the lack of individual protection throughout the world, and WHO warned that for this reason health workers would be under attack.
In Australia, buyers in the Daigo system were given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods in China.
This activity led to a lack of child nutrition in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Government of Australia. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Uhan region, as well as the high demand for food, both areas were able to avoid acute food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation of stocks and illicit trade in products which have proved to be successful have prevented the acute food shortages that were expected in Europe and in North America.
Northern Italy, with small-scale agricultural production, did not have a significant fall, but, in the view of industry, agricultural prices could increase.
Lots of food stores remained vacant only temporarily, even in the city of Uhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pig stocks to ensure the full feeding of the population.
Similar laws, which require food producers to preserve food stocks in case of emergencies, also exist in Italy.
The damage caused by the world economy has affected China: according to the media of 16 March, China's economy has been severely affected in the first two months of 2020 due to measures to combat the spread of the virus adopted by the Government, resulting in a decrease of 20.5% in differential sales.
Maternal China is a major economic and productive centre; therefore, a virus blast is considered to pose a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
According to Agate Demarai, Economist Intelligence Unit staff, market volatility will continue until a clearer picture of potential results appears.
In January 2020, some analysts estimate that the economic impact of the current global growth epidemic may be greater than that of the atypical pneumonia epidemic from 2002 to 2004.
According to one of the assessments made by a Washington University expert in St. Louis, the damage to the world supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact could be up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC) has begun to take “fast measures” following a sharp decline in oil prices due to China's demand for oil.
On 24 February, world stock markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside of mainland China.
On 27 February, due to the growing fear of the outbreak of coronary virus, various United States fund indices, including NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 and the Doo-Johns index for industrial companies, have shown the most rapid decline since 2008, with the Doo index falling by 1191, the largest one-day drop since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed more than a 10-percent drop.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative forecast.
The actions again fell due to concerns about the spread of coronary virus, and the biggest drop occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that there is a likelihood of economic recession.
The economist, Mohamed El-Erian, commended the timely emergency measures taken by the central banks and States.
Central banks respond faster than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors in terms of bans on movement, the closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and the recommendations of Governments to make no travel.
As a result of all these measures, many airlines have cancelled flights due to a sharp reduction in the demand for aircraft, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British regional Flybe has ceased to exist.
The impact on the cross-lines industry has been as strong as ever.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chung-jun, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year's celebrations.
National and regional Governments have abolished a number of activities involving a large number of people, including annual new festivals; private companies have also closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many new-year activities have been cancelled and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent mass graves; for example, the prohibited city has been closed in Beijing and traditional temple yards have been removed.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and areas of China, the authorities extended the new-year canals until 10 February, indicating that the majority of enterprises are not open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of GDP in the country and 90 per cent of exports.
The Hong Kong authorities have raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and have announced an emergency, closing schools by March and canceling the New Year's celebration. The retail sector has been affected globally: stores have been reduced and some shops have been temporarily closed.
A 40 per cent drop in the number of retail outlets in Europe and Latin America.
Diversification companies in North America and the Middle East have reduced sales by between 50 and 60 per cent.
As a result, the attendance of trade centres fell by 33 to 43 per cent in March compared to February.
Operators of trade centres around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improved sanitation, equipment to check the temperature of visitors and cancel activities. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, a recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic may leave 14-22 million more people behind poverty than it would have been in a similar situation, but without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China in the aftermath of the Uganda epidemic.
Many of the 300 million Chinese rural migrant workers were housed in their country's provinces or closed in the province of Hubey. In March 2020 more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
According to the estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, in the United States, the explosion of the crown virus could cause 47 million people to lose their jobs and the unemployment rate can reach 32 per cent. Self-insulation measures introduced in India will leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers unemployed on a daily basis. A study conducted by the Institute of Angus Reida showed that 44 per cent of Canadian households have faced unemployment, and almost 900 000 Spanish workers have also lost jobs since the introduction of strict isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a single social payment. Almost half a million companies in Germany transferred their staff to a government-subsidized reduced working day.
The German labour pay scheme for the incomplete working day was also introduced in France and the United Kingdom.
The fields of art and cultural heritage have also been severely affected by the pandemic, which has affected the activities of organizations as well as individuals, whether officially employed or independent, worldwide.
Cultural and artistic organizations have tried to support their (very funded) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for society, ensuring the safety of their staff and the public, as well as, as far as possible, supporting the people of art.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions had been closed for an indefinite period or had access to them at different levels, and exhibitions, events and presentations had been cancelled or transferred to other dates.
Efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms; yet another recent and emerging traffic following the spread of the virus is the abolition of religious services, major sporting activities and other public events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion displays.
The Vatican announced the abolition of the Easter Week in Rome, which took place during the last week of the Christian Repentant period, the Great Post.
Many parishes recommend that older Christians stay at home and not attend Sunday services; in some churches, church services begin to be broadcast on radio, live air, or on television, while some church leaders offer open air services.
The Roman Catholic Church of Rome closed to visit its churches, the clocks and the St. Peter's Square, where there are no more Christian palaces, and later other religious organizations also abolished the services and restricted access to public services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and temples.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the abolition of Friday's prayers in areas affected by the blast of the crown virus and the temples were later closed; Saudi Arabia banned the access of foreign settlers and their own inhabitants to the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sports events since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or transferred, including the WEFA 2019-20 Championships League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the 2019-20th Euro 2020 WEFA, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The blast of the crown virus also destroyed the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics to begin at the end of July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be “transferred after 2020 but not later than the summer of 2021”. Casinos and other incinerators around the world were closed and poker tournaments, which are usually broadcast in direct air, were either transferred or cancelled.
This has led many players to go online, and many gambling sites report a significant increase in the number of new subscribers, and the entertainment industry has also suffered because different music groups have suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many major theatres, such as shipwrights, have also canceled all their performances.
As an alternative to traditional off-line events, some artists and musicians have started to explore options for continuing their activities and sharing their results on the Internet, to organise direct broadcasts of online concerts or web-festivals; this helps people to continue to perform, publish or publish their productions.
There have been numerous online mems on the subject of coronavirus, many of which are jumoristic, and are alleging alarming attitudes that are characterized by uncertainty periods.
Since the occurrence of COVID-19, there has been an increase in bias, xenophobia and racism towards Chinese citizens and people of East Asian origin, as well as the representatives of the peoples of the hot spots of Europe, the United States and other countries.
Fear, suspicion and hostility have been reported in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
In the February briefings (when most of the infection was still limited by China), racist attitudes were recorded in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens, who were likely to deserve the virus or have received a fair reward for something.
In some African countries, anti-Chinese attitudes have also increased.
Many of the inhabitants of Uganda and Cuba reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
China's citizens, as well as its residents living in areas affected by the virus, have been supported both in offline and online mode.
The epidemic has begun to spread in new countries, in particular in Italy, the first in Europe, which has experienced the serious outbreak of COVID-19; in this context, citizens of such regions may also be affected by suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have signed a petition early to prevent Chinese citizens from entering their countries to contain the epidemic.
In Japan, Haitteg #ChineseDontComeToJapan (#ChineseDon't GoToJapan) took the leading positions on Twitter.
China's citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States, report on the growing levels of racist attitudes and even attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump met with criticism of the fact that he called the crown virus “Chinese virus”; critics consider it racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign citizens to New Sanjara evacuated from Uhana.
Students arriving from the border with China, North-East India, and learning in large cities in India, reported cases of the outbreak of the coronary virus.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatia Janat State Department, West Bengalia, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and therefore “God has avenged them”.
Later, these statements were condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta, which called them “demonstration”, and in China, because of the pandemic, xenophobia and racism again erupted in relation to non-Chinese citizens: foreigners became “foreign garbage” and objects to be “utilized”.
Many newspapers with free access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all of the areas affected by the coronary virus.
Many scholars have made their scientific articles about the blast of the crown virus available to them.
Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to the results of their studies on print publishing servers, such as bioRxiv.
Dissemination of infection — Infection from returning pathogen, range of distribution or method of transmission often unknown
Globalization and disease — Overview of globalization and the spread of diseases
List of epidemics and pandemics — List of deaths from infectious diseases
The smuggling of wild animals and diseases transmitted from animal to animal is a health risk associated with the trafficking of exotic animals.
Laboratory testing of the respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and its associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes virus detection methods and detection methods of antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by the OTCR, which recognizes the coronvirus RNA.
This test is specific and intended only for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm enough recent or active infections.
Antithelial detection (serolology) can be used both for diagnostics and for the purpose of population control.
Analgesics detect the number of people who have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too minor to treat them in the hospital or were not at all present.
The exact level of mortality from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of such a test.
As of March 2020, because of limited testing capacity, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population.
By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and information on the number of tests carried out in different countries was quite contradictory.
Such differences in information may have a significant impact on registered mortality rates, which may be significantly exaggerated in some countries.
With the polymeric chain reaction of real-time transcription (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on the respiratory pathways obtained in different ways, including the nose or wet model.
The results are usually available for a period of several hours to 2 days.
The OTCR test carried out in the cervical glands is only valid during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear from the throat, but still reproduce in the soft.
In infected patients tested for the second week of the disease, materials may be taken from the lower respiratory tract by means of a decontamination catheter or refractory products may be used.
One of the early PCR tests was developed at Sharita, Berlin, in January 2020, using a polymeric chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) and a set of 250,000 sets that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom also developed its test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a set of findings for SARS-CoV-2 based on the clinical level PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
He identified the “E” gene, common for all beta-coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene, specific for SARS-CoV-2. China’s BGI Group became one of the first companies authorised by China’s National Drug Administration to use an emergency kit for detection of SARS-CoV-2 based on PCR. In the United States, the Disease Control and Prevention Centre (CDC) distributes its diagnostic panel to perform RT-PCR in real-time (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel in public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests from the oldest versions of the test sets produced incomplete results due to married reagents and the narrow testing area conducted by CDC in Atlanta; as a result, less than 100 samples were successfully processed during the whole of February 2020.
Two-component tests were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that date were public and local laboratories allowed to start testing.
The testing was approved by the Food and Medicinal Surveillance Office under an emergency application permit. The US commercial laboratories began testing early in March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 infection based on RT-PCR across the country.
Quest Diagnostics started testing at COVID-19 throughout the country since 9 March 2020.
No quantitative restrictions were declared; the collection and processing of analyses should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, a COVID-19 test was developed and carried out by the State Research Centre for Virus and Biotechnology “WECTOR”.
On 11 February 2020, it was reported that on 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect the infection COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for the use of a test that can be performed for 3.5 hours in large quantities, allowing one machine to process approximately 4128 tests for 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, FDA issued an emergency (U.S.) permission to Abbott laboratories for the Abbott m2000 tests; previously, FDA granted such permission to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020 Cepheid also receives the USA from the FDA for a test duration of about 45 minutes.
The FDA also approved a test using the technology for the amplification of isothermic nucleic acid instead of PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of cycles of fluxing temperatures, this method can detect positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently around 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. Taiwan is currently developing a test using a monoclonal antibody, which is specifically linked to the nucleocapsid white (N-white) of the new coronavirus, and there is hope for results within 15-20 minutes, such as a flu test.
The review of the specialized literature for March 2020 concludes that “the X-rays of the breast cell have a small diagnostic value at early stages, while the results of the CT [computer tomography] may have such value even before symptoms occur”.
The typical signs identified during the CTC include bilateral multidimensional sub-floor focusses of mating glass type with peripheral, asymmetric and a posterior distribution.
Subsequent domination, the symptom of bile bridges and consolidation are evolving as the disease progresses.
The results of the study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Uhana at the time of the current pandemic showed that CT was much more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, since many of its visualization functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation “not to use CTC for boxing or as a first line test method in the COVID-19 diagnosis”. As of March 2020, CDC for the original box recommends using the PCR method.
A partial immune response to infection is expressed in the development of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in humans after the 7th day of symptoms, to identify immunity and to carry out population control. Analysis can be performed in central laboratories (CLTs) or by on-site diagnostics (PACTs)
In many clinical laboratories, these analyses will be able to perform highly automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each system.
The CLT usually uses one specimen of peripheral blood, although serial samples can be used to track the immune response.
In POC, one sample of blood is usually given through the perforation of each cover.
Unlike PCR methods, the blood collection phase for sampling is not required. On 26 March 2020, FDA appointed 29 organizations that have passed all necessary registration procedures and can now pass their tests on the antibodies.
As of 7 April 2020, the FDA approved only one emergency application permit test. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European permits for the use of their test kits, which can be identified in samples of IgG and IgA antibodies capable of combating the virus.
The test performance is several hundred samples over several hours and therefore this method works much faster than the usual PCR analysis of the viral RNA.
The antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after infection. In early April, Britain found that none of the kits it acquired for the analysis of the antibodies were satisfactory.
In Hong Kong, a schedule was developed to allow patients suspected of virus to stay at home: “Immediate assistance officers are transferring the sample sample to the patient,” the patient floats, returns and receives the test results for some time. The British NHS announced the launch of its pilot trial scheme for suspected cases in domestic conditions that eliminates the risk of infection by other visitors of the clinic, or the need to disinfect the early-help machine if used for the patient’s transport. In case of suspicious cases, a medical worker is being analysed using all appropriate precautions.
The expression centres helped South Korea organize one of the fastest and widest testing procedures in any country. On 2 March, the German National Association of Compulsory Medical Insurance Doctors stated that they were ready to carry out some 12,000 tests per day in ambulatory conditions and only 10,700 tests a week earlier.
If the survey is appointed by a doctor, the costs are covered by medical insurance.
According to President Robert Koha, Germany ' s overall test productivity is 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, an expression test was proposed in several major cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests submitted in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that as a calendar week 12/20 at SARS-CoV-2 a total of 483,295 analyses were taken up to 12/20, including 33,491 samples (6,9%) of positive results. Researchers at the Israeli Clinic Technology and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a simultaneous test method for samples taken from 64 patients, combining samples and carrying out further analyses only if the combined sample showed positive results. On 5 February 2020, BGI opened a temporary laboratory at 2000 sq. m. on the detection of emergency cases called “Ho-Jan” (hereinafter referred to as “the Chinese model”) or “the same day”).
The construction of the laboratory was organized by the founder of BGI Van Xyan and completed in only 5 days; the modeling showed that, if the laboratory had not been operated at such an accelerated rate, the incidence of disease in Hubea would have been 47 per cent higher and, therefore, quarantine costs would also have been twice as high.
After the opening of the laboratory in Uhana, the laboratories Huo-Jan in Shenzhen, Tianzzin, Beijing and Shanghai were immediately opened in a total of 12 cities in China.
By 4 March 2020, the daily total capacity ratios were 50,000 tests per day, with open multiplex schemes Origami Assays that can test up to 1,22 patient analyses on COVID19 using only 93 samples. Such balanced structures can work in small laboratories, except for the use of robotic fluid manipulators.
By March, due to the lack and lack of reagents, mass testing in the EU, Britain and the United States had become problematic.
As a result, some authors have referred to the protocols for the processing of test samples, which provide for the heating of samples at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes in order to release RNA genes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the level of coronavirus testing by the United Arab Emirates per capita is currently higher than that of any other country, and the majority of the population will soon be tested.
This was due to the ability to perform an express test, along with the acquisition of the Group 42 and the BGI mass testing laboratory (established on the basis of their laboratory for the detection of the emergencies of Huo-Jan in China).
This 14-day laboratory is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the world's first such large-scale laboratory operating outside China.
Various testing options were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted a German version of the production of test kits that are sent to low-income countries with no resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Health and Epidemiological Centres was not available until 28 January, which resulted in a lack of testing kits in the United States. At the beginning of the outbreak in China and the United States, there were problems with the reliability of the kits, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide enough kits recommended by health experts.
In South Korea, according to experts, the wide availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronary virus.
For several years, the Government of South Korea has been working on providing testing facilities, mainly in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for greater development of testing programmes as the best way to slow down the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the increase in the demand for testing caused by the rapid virus spread, many US private laboratories, which received hundreds of thousands of samples of analysis, were overloaded and stockpiles of brain and chemical reagents were rapidly drained.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The American test kits developed by CDC were “deficient” and for this reason the Government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing. Spain acquired test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of these kits were inadequate.
The company explained that the reasons for the inaccuracies of the results could be a failure to collect samples or incorrect use of sets.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would respond to the incorrect results set and replace them with other sets of Shenzhen Bioeasy sets. 80% of the test sets that the Czech Republic has acquired in China had incorrect results. 1.2 million test sets acquired by Slovakia in China were also found to be incorrect.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they should be dropped in Danube. Ates Kara, a member of the Ministry of Health of Turkey, claimed that the test kits purchased in China had “high level of errors” and the Ministry “did not make use of them”. Britain purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but in early April 2020 it was announced that these kits were not suitable for use.
Quarantine measures for persons whose analyses have produced positive results on SARS-CoV-2, as well as monitoring of those who have been contacted by such patients have had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, where for the first time in Italy, a man died from COVID-19, conducted two test cycles of the entire population of approximately 3400, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed disease were quarantined.
The entrance to the territory of the human settlements was closed and the spread of the infection was halted.
In the context of intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine of the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic in Singapore, there was much less tension than in other developed countries, and there was no need to impose extreme restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and shops.
Many activities were cancelled there, and on 28 March Singapore began to urge residents to stay at home, but the schools that ended on 23 March were opened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also dealt with the pandemic through intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine, but are less aggressive.
The statistical study showed that in countries where more tests were carried out compared to the number of deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because these countries had been able to identify more patients with poor symptoms or lack of symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative results to COVID-19 in one of 16 WHO control laboratories to confirm testing.
7 of these 16 control laboratories are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the next schedule, the indicators of the column ‘positive results’ depend on the testing policy adopted in a particular country.
The country where only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher positive result in percentages than the country where all citizens are tested, regardless of the symptoms of the virus, under other equal conditions.
Hands, also known as “Hygiene hand”, are the process of cleaning hands to remove contamination, fats, micro-organisms or other harmful substances.
Regular washing of hands with soap during certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted orally.
A person may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or regular cold, such as eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. loosely wrapped) with unwashed hands.
Five critical moments during the day after which the hands should be washed with soap: before and after the disinfection, after washing the child's barley or changing the pans, before feeding the child, before eating, and before and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish and domestic birds.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with zola. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during, and after cooking.
Before and after the care of the sick person.
After changing the towels or washing the child in the toilet.
After snorkeling, coughing, or squeezing.
After touching animals, feed or waste of animal origin.
The medical hygiene of the hands is related to the health activities associated with medical procedures.
The rubbing of hands before taking medication or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of washing is to clean hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other micro-organisms capable of causing diseases) as well as from chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who are preparing or working in the medical field, but it is also important for all others.
Hands are very useful for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronary virus and other infectious diseases, prevents infections of diarrhoea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
It also reduces infant mortality in households.
The 2013 study showed that better hand washing can lead to a slight acceleration in the growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoea can be reduced by adopting simple habits, such as washing hands with soap.
This basic procedure is able to reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular hand washing reminders can reduce the number of diarrhea cases to about three, and this is comparable to the benefit of low-income regions of clean water.
The reduction in diarrhoea by 48 per cent may be related to the washing of hands with soap; washing hands with soap is the only effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory diseases (PRCs), provided that appropriate habits are developed in each house, in schools and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main complications of ORI, is the major cause of mortality among children under the age of five, who have lived for about 1.8 million children a year.
Of diarrhea and pneumonia, almost 3.5 million children are killed each year.
The United Nations Children ' s Fund reports that washing hands with soap before and after eating and after the toilet, which has become a solid habit, can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention taken separately, and reduce the mortality from diarrhoea almost twice and the mortality from acute respiratory infections to four.
The wash is usually combined with other sanitary activities carried out under water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
The hands also prevent the onset of impetitis — a disease that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A small negative consequence of frequent washing of the hands is that it can lead to skin drying and, in fact, to damage it.
The 2012 Danish study showed that too often washing hands can lead to swelling and swelling of the skin – a disease known as exema or dermatitis, which is particularly common among health workers.
Too often, hand washing may also be considered a symptom of an obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five so-called “critical moments” during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of faecal or oral transmission: after emptying (logging, defecation), after washing the baby’s stomachs (change of pancreas), before feeding the child, before taking food, and before/after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or birds.
Some other cases where hands should be washed to prevent transmission of the disease: before or after cutting or wound treatment, after brushing, coughing or swallowing, after touching the waste of animal origin or animals, after touching the debris.
In many countries, washing hands with soap is relatively low.
A study conducted in 54 countries in 2015 showed that on average 38.7 per cent of myeloids are common practice. The 2014 study showed that the highest figure, 97 per cent, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the United States is close to the average, 77 per cent; the lowest rate was recorded in China – 23 per cent. There are currently several methods of changing myeloids and developing myeloids in critical situations. In developing countries, the group of myeloids in schools are one of the methods used to help children learn about this process.
“The emergency medical care programme, implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines, is an example of large-scale activities to strengthen child health and raise the level of education of children.
This national programme is based on degelminization, which is carried out twice a year, as well as daily brushing and daily brushing.
The same programme is being successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of micro-organisms from each cover is more effective if the washing process adds flour or molar.
The main action of mills and mills is to remove barriers to the solubility and improvement of its level.
Water itself is not considered to be an effective means of cleansing the skin, since fats and proteins, which are components of organic contamination, are poorly dissolved in water.
A sufficient amount of water, however, contributes to the cleanup process.
Durable soap may also contain bacteria that may fall on it during previous use.
A small number of studies on the incidence of each cover of bacteria from the contaminated lump of solid honey show a low probability of such a drop, since the bacteria are depleting with the penis.
The CPC still claims that “any hand-to-hand mill is a preferred option for hand-to-hand washing”.
Antibacterial soap is actively advertised in health-care communities.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended contraceptives or disinfectants has a selective effect on organisms that have resistance to antibiotics by their nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclosane, to which a stable number of resistant strains of organisms are present.
Thus, even if the strains resistant to antibiotics are not selective in relation to the antibacterial mill, their effectiveness may not be consistent with the advertising.
In addition to surface-active substances and skin protection agents, complex compounds may contain acids (absorbed, ascorbic, milky) as an RN regulator, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other leaks (aloe faith, vitamins, mantol, extracts of plants). The comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that in the prevention of diseases and removal of bacteria from the skin, simple varieties of honey were as effective as normal antibacterial soap containing triclozan.
Hot water is still not hot enough for human skin to kill bacteria.
The bacteria reproduce much faster at the body temperature of 37°C.
However, for the removal of natural fats that contain contamination and bacteria, hot water is more effective than cold.
In spite of popular opinion, research has shown that the use of hot water does not affect the reduction of the microbial load on the hands.
Disinfective hand (sanitizer) or hand antiseptic is a non-water - free hand.
In the late 1990s and early in the 21st century, the use of alcohol-free hand hygiene (also known as alcohol-based hand disinfectants, antiseptic hand disinfectants or sanitizers) has become popular.
Most of these products are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with the addition of fertilizers such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of gel, or humidifiers such as glycerin in liquid or pen, which facilitate the use of these substances and reduce the effect of drying the skin with alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen re-acids further increases antimicrobial activity; disinfectants containing at least 60-95 per cent alcohol effectively destroy the microbes.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccination, influenza and hepatitis) and flu.
Disinfectants containing 70 per cent of alcohol kill 99.97 per cent of bacteria (a logarithm of 3.5, similar to a 35 decibel reduction) in the hands after 30 seconds of use and 99.99 per cent to 99.999 per cent of bacteria (a logarithm of 4-5) in the hands after 1 minute of use. Disinfectants for the hands are most effective against the bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are virtually ineffective against neuroviral (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of infection. A sufficient amount of antiseptics or alcohol-containing agents should be used to treat and wash the skin from both sides.
The face and back surfaces of both bearings, as well as the space between fingers, shall grow for about 30 seconds until the liquid, pen or gel is fully absorbed.
The U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centre recommends that the use of disinfectants should be made of handwashing rather than disinfectants, especially if their hands are severely contaminated.
The increase in the popularity of such disinfectants is due to the ease of use and rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but should not be a substitute for complete washing if water and soap are available.
The frequent use of disinfectants for alcohol-based hands may cause dry skin if their composition does not contain softening agents and/or skin moisturizers.
The effects of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other softening substances to the product.
In clinical trials, alcohol-derived disinfectants containing softening components caused much less irritation and dryness of the skin than myel or antimicrobial motives.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact dropper syndrome or hypersensitive to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants are virtually absent.
The lower probability of a disturbing contact dermatitis has been a factor in the choice of disinfectants compared to soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water resources do not wash their hands from organic substances but simply disinfect them.
That is why hand disinfectants are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens, such as ordinary soap and water, as the pathogens are still on hand when they are used.
The effectiveness of the disinfectant for alcohol-free hands depends largely on components and composition and has historically been significantly lower than that of alcohol or alcohol-containing products.
It has recently been demonstrated that the medicinal products used with benzalkonium chloride have a persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, which has been proven to lose efficacy after multiple use, probably due to progressive side-effects.
Many people in low - income communities cannot afford to make a living and replace it with gold or clay.
Zole or clay may be more effective than simply water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One problem with this method is that if clay or gold is contaminated by micro-organisms, it may, on the other hand, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, gold is a disinfectant, since when it comes to water, it forms a cellular solution.
If flour is not available, it is recommended to use gold or sand as an alternative to WHO.
In order to prevent infection of the U.S. Disease Control Centre, it is recommended that handwashing techniques include the following stages:
Wash your hands under warm or cold running water.
It is recommended that water flows because standing water may be contaminated, and that is the temperature of the water is not relevant at all.
Help your hands by growing them with a large amount of soap, including the back of the laundromats, as well as the area between fingers and feet.
It removes the microbes from the skin, and studies show that using soap (not just one water) people tend to wash their hands more carefully.
Three hands at least 20 seconds.
Trini helps remove the microbes from the skin, and as long as you're third-hand, more microbes are removed.
Wash your hands thoroughly under running water.
Re-infection may be caused by hand-dropping in standing water.
Wash your hands with clean air, or let them dry up by themselves.
Wet and wet hands are more easily contaminated, and most often people leave such areas as large fingers, wrists, toes and toes.
The artificial nails and the shimmering nails for the nails can contain a number of microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use a moisturizing rod to prevent the drying of the hands that could cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If water and soap are not available, there are many different low-cost ways of washing hands: pouring water from hanging canisters or bottlenecks with opened openings and/or using gold, if necessary, as is the case in developing countries. In areas with limited water supply (e.g. in schools or rural areas in developing countries) there are water-saving solutions such as foot-and-mouthed cranes and other low-value options.
It is a simple structure made up of a welded wire and a welded weld that should be pressed to wash the water on its hands, and a piece of soap should be used.
The effective drying of hands is an integral part of the hygiene process, but there are some disputes about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
The growing amount of research shows that paper caps are much more hygienic than electric dryers for the hands that are set in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study sponsored by the European Symposium on Paper Soils and Poultry; this study compared the level of hygiene of paper poultices, hand dryers with warm air and more modern air dryers for hand.
It was found that after washing and dry hands in the hot air, the total number of bacteria in the fingertips increased on average by 194 per cent and 254 per cent in the lorries.
It was also found that after washing and dry hands in the dry air, the total number of bacteria in the fingertips increased by 42 per cent and 15 per cent in the laundromats.
After washing and dry hands, the total number of bacteria in the fingernails is reduced to 76 per cent and in the laundromats to 77 per cent. Researchers have also tested the possibility of cross-contamination of several visitors to the toilets and the toilet environment in each type of dry matter.
The air-dryer, which emits air at declared speeds 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 km/h), is capable of pushing micro-organisms from their hands and from their own block and potentially infecting other users of the bathroom and toilet in a radius of up to 2 metres.
The use of hot-air dryers spreads micro-organisms in the range of up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.
In 2005, TÜV Product und Umwelt carried out a study on the evaluation of various dry-hand methods.
The following changes are observed in the number of bacteria depending on the dry-hand method:
There are many different productions of dryers for the hands and dryers for the hands are compared to dry paper pillows.
Cleaning hands using disinfectant can be an alternative in the absence of soap and water.
The disinfectant should contain at least 60 per cent of alcohol.
The medical method of washing hands became mandatory long after Hungarian doctor Ignac Zemmelweis found it to be highly effective (in 1846) in the prevention of disease under stable conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget about it.
According to one study, the use of such devices really helps reduce the level of infection.
The handwashing process takes at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap, water or gel to wash and wipe each part of the hand.
Hands should be carefully wrapped around each other, shaking their fingers.
If there is a sin under the feet, the damage can be used to remove it.
Since microbes can remain in the water present on their hands, it is important to wash them thoroughly and remove the moisture from the air.
After dry hands, closing the crane and, if necessary, closing and opening any doors, the paper bearings should be used.
This allows to avoid re-contamination of the hands from these surfaces.
The aim of washing hands in medical facilities is to remove pathogens (microbials) and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing remains unacceptable in most medical institutions: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before they touch the patients and thus spread microorganisms.
As a result of one study, proper washing of hands and other basic procedures may reduce the level of catheter-related infections by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a standard hand-washing and hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-to-hand-hand-hand-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-----------to--------to----to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-----to-------to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to---------------to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to------------to-to-to-to-to--------------------------------------------------------------------------------to-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ro custom----------------------------------------------------------------------ro custom custom custom custom custom custom custom custom-------------------------roro custom-rororororo custom-ro custom-ro custom-ro custom-ro custom-ro custom-roro custom-rororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororo custom-rororororo-rorororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororo custom-rororororororororororororororororororororo-pa-pa-pa-ro custom-ro custom-pa-ro custom-pa-pa-pa-pa-ro custom-ro custom-ro custom-pa-ro custom-ro custom-ro custom-rororo custom-ro custom-rororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororo-ro-pa-pa-rorororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororororo-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-roro-parorororo--rororororororo custom-rororororororororororororororororororororororororo custom---rororororororo custom-rororororo custom-----------rororororororororororororororororororororororororororo-do
The WHO Health Guide is also available on its website and open to public discussion.
The corresponding review was carried out by Whitby in the sponsorship.
If a confirmation of compliance with the regulatory requirements is required, commercial devices may be used to measure the indicators and check the hygiene.
The World Health Organization represents “five moments” when it is necessary to wash hands:
After contact with blood or biological fluids,
prior to the use of antiseptics, as well as
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to myeloma by washing hands (medicine or antimicrobial) helps destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be required prior to surgery or in the environment of organisms resistant to antibiotics. To “clean” hands before surgery, a crane can be included and excluded, regardless of its hands; a little chloroxide or iodine should also be used to cool hands, sterile handshake after washing, sterile damage to the third and other sterile tool for cleaning under the feet.
All decorations must be removed.
This procedure usually requires washing hands and pre-washing for 2 to 6 minutes.
You don't have to shake your hands too long, for example, 10 minutes.
At the time of application, the water with precipitates should not fall back on the brush of the hands.
After the wash is finished, the hands dry with sterile cloth and put on a surgical coat.
To reduce the spread of microbes, better wash your hands or use antiseptics for the hands before and after the care of the sick person.
In order to combat staphylococcus infections in hospitals, it was found that the first 20 per cent of the wash was the most beneficial, and that very few additional benefits were obtained when the washout rate was increased by more than 35 per cent.
Compared to the antibacterial mill, the normal milling has increased more than threefold the incidence of bacterial infections transmitted through food. The comparison of the antibacterial milling and antibacterial milling has shown that the treatment of antibacterial milling has decreased by 26 per cent relative to antibacterial milling.
However, soap and water are more effective than hand-washing solutions, in order to reduce the amount of influenza A H1N1 virus and the Clostridium difficile dispute. Health care activities in medical institutions may include training of hand-washing personnel, improving the availability of hand-washing solutions, and written and oral reminders to staff on the need to wash hands.
Further research is needed on the most effective types of measures in various health institutions.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as an economically effective and important means of improving health and even nutrition.
However, the lack of stable water supply, soap or tools to wash hands at home, in schools and in workplaces makes it difficult to get used to washing hands regularly.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are not far from each private or public toilet, although there are also cheap ways to organize washing in such places.
However, insufficient hand hygiene can also be caused by roots rather than by lack of soap or water.
The promotion and promotion of handwashing can affect political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term changes in the behaviour of the population.
In order to ensure the effectiveness of such measures, results should be monitored and evaluated.
A system analysis of 70 studies found that, in order to improve the health situation in countries with lower average income, effective community-level health and epidemic surveillance, while public marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of the promotion of school wash is the approach of the United Nations Children's Fund Three Star Approach: it promotes the implementation of simple economic measures in schools that stimulate breastwashing by students using soap, as well as other health requirements.
By ensuring compliance with minimum standards, schools can improve their level from one to three stars.
The establishment of handicrafts is one of the possible measures implemented in the context of hand-held information campaigns to reduce the level of disease and child mortality.
The World Hand Washing Day (Global Hand Washing Day) is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behaviour. As a result of the 2019-20 pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund is promoting the use of an emotion symbolizing the washing of hands.
Some studies considered the overall effectiveness of washing hands in developing countries compared with the DALYs (saved years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that stimulating the washing of hands with soap is a much more economical solution than other sanitary measures.
The importance of washing hands for human health — especially for vulnerable categories of people, such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was first recognized by two in the middle of the 19th century in the field of hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis (Ignaz Semmelweis), working in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale (Florence Nightingale), an English nurse and “the founder of modern care for the sick”.
At the same time, most people still believed that infections were caused by rotting smells called miasms.
In the 1980s, as a result of outbreaks of food-borne diseases and infections related to medical care, the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention have become more active in promoting hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have improved their understanding of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, handicrafts in public toilets, as well as office buildings and airport toilets, were decorated with “correct hand washing techniques”.
The phrase “to wash your hands” means to show your unwillingness to accept responsibility for something or to be a party to something.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate “washed his hands ” in deciding on Jesus Christ’s enthronement; then this phrase became more widely used in some English communities.
In the play "Macbeth" Shakespeare, Lady McBeth begins to wash her hands unscrupulously in an attempt to clean up from the imaginary Friday, symbolizing an unclean conscience, in connection with the crimes she committed by herself and moved her husband to commit.
It was also found that people who remembered or observed any non-ethical action were inclined to wash their hands more often than others, and handcuffs were more important to them.
Also, it is less likely that people who have been able to wash their hands after seeing them will participate in any other “cleaning” compensating activities, such as volunteer activities.
In religions the washing of hands is both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning. The symbolic washing of hands with water, but without soap, is a part of the ritual prescribed in many religions, including Bahiaism, Hinduism, Tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe the washing of hands, especially after certain actions.
Indians, Judaism, and Islam are required to wash their hands after a visit to the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after each meal.
Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19
Control of production factors in the context of COVID-19 implies the use of methods to ensure safety of work and health in order to control the risk and control of coronal virus in 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate control of the risks at work depends on the place and job, based on risk assessment, the severity of the epidemic in the community and risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The United States Office for Labour and Industrial Health (OSHA) reported that lower-risk positions have minimal professional contacts with the public and colleagues, and in such cases basic measures are required to combat infection, including washing hands, encouraging workers to stay at home with signs of disease, compliance with the respiratory label, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The medium-risk duties require frequent or close contact with persons who do not have a confirmed or suspected COPID-19 diagnosis, but there is a likelihood of infection due to the current spread of disease in society or during international travel.
Such a category may include public-contact workers, such as schools, the working environment with high population density and some large retail stores.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to the basic measures to prevent infection, include air-conditioning using high-efficiency air filters, the use of protective screens and the availability of personal protection in the event of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA believes that medical and morgue staff who have contacted a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of co-infection are high-risk categories, while the risk is increased to a very high level in the conduct of aerosol education procedures or the collection/processing of human samples with a confirmed diagnosis or co-inspection.
Risk control measures suitable for such staff include the use of engineering and safety equipment, such as ventilation rooms with negative pressure, as well as personal protective equipment suitable for the task.
The cry of COVID-19 can have different types of effects on the workplace.
Workers may not be at work because of their own illness, the need to care for others or because of the fear of possible infection.
Commercial templates may vary with respect to both the types of goods on which demand exists and the means by which such goods are acquired (e.g. purchases in non-peak times with delivery or service without leaving the car).
Finally, it is possible to reverse the delivery of goods from geographical regions affected by COVID-19. A plan for preparedness and response can be used in the protection of the epidemic.
The plans address risks related to different workplaces and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors arising from home and communities, as well as risk factors for individual workers, such as age or chronic diseases.
Plans also identify the means of monitoring the risks involved, as well as emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Plans for preparedness for the epidemic and response may be subject to national or state-level recommendations.
Some of the objectives of response to the epidemic are to reduce the spread of the virus among staff, to protect people at higher risk of serious health difficulties, to maintain business operations and to minimize negative impacts on other organizations in their supply chains.
Responses have an impact on the severity of diseases in the community where the business is located.
The risk control hierarchy is a structure widely used in the provision of safety and health care to group such funds according to efficiency.
In the absence of the possibility of eliminating the risk of COVID-19, the most effective means of engineering and safety, then administrative measures and, finally, personal protection.
Engineering security means isolation of workers from workplaces and does not rely on the worker ' s behaviour, which can be the most economically beneficial solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in labour policies or procedures requiring action by the employee or staff member.
Personal protection funds (PPEs) are considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but may help address some risks.
All types of personal protection must be selected depending on the threat to the worker, approach the size (e.g. respirators), be used regularly and properly, be properly checked, maintained and replaced as necessary, and be properly removed, cleaned and stored or used to avoid contamination.
The United States Office for Labour and Industrial Health (OSHA) believes that low-risk posts have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic measures to combat the epidemic recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough washing of hands, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, compliance with the respiratory label, including the closing of the mouth with cough and choking, the provision of garbage-salves and containers, the readiness to remove or replace work, as appropriate, recommendations for workers to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, as well as the day-to-day cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of persons who may be potentially infected is a critical step to protect workers, clients, visitors and others at work.
The U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that staff with acute respiratory symptoms stay at home before the heat is stopped, lack of an elevated body temperature and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of anti-fungal drugs or other medicines that remove symptoms, and prescribe the flexibility of hospitalized policies, allow staff to stay at home to care for the sick family member and to inform staff about such policies.
According to OSHA, high-risk positions require frequent and close contact of no more than six feet (1.8 m) with persons with no confirmed data or suspicion of infection with COVID-19, but there is a likelihood of infection with SARS-CoV-2 with regard to the spread of disease in the business territory or with the recent visits of such a person to the place of distribution of COVID-19.
These categories include employees who are in contact with the public, for example, in schools, the working environment with high population density and some large retail stores. The engineering and security tools for such groups and groups at higher risk include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation intensity, the installation of physical barriers, such as transparent plastic protection screens, and installation of non-automatic services. Administrative measures for such a group and higher risk groups include the recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, replace personal meetings for communication with virtual means, the establishment of variables, the setting of variables, the closure of variables, the closure of non-critial journeys in the area of the car without driving out of the car.
In rare cases, workers in such a risk group may be required to carry a breather.
In order to ensure the proper safety of workers and other passengers, measures such as isolation of the sick person from other people at 6 feet, appointment of a member of the staff to care for the sick person, the provision of a sick mask or the treatment of such a person with a request to cover the nose and mouth with a ulvet in cough or choking.
Secondary crew members should wear one-time medical gloves when approaching the sick traveler or when facing physical fluids or potentially infected surfaces and possibly additional personal protection if they have a fever, regular cough or difficulty breathing.
The gloves and other disposable items used should be placed in a biologically safe bag and the contaminated surfaces should subsequently be cleaned and disinfected. In cases of commercial navigation, including cruise liners and other passenger ships, the security measures include the delay of travel in the event of illness, isolation and immediate information from the medical centre to the ship when there is heat or other symptoms on board.
Ideally, a medical examination should be carried out in an isolated cabin of such a person; in the case of schools and childcare facilities, CDC recommends that a short-term closure be made for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person was in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
If there is a minimum or average level of infection in the community, social distance strategies can be introduced, such as the cancellation of trips to personal meetings, meetings and other mass activities, such as physical or feeding, food intake in the cafeteria, increased distance between parties, time management of arrival and care, the limitation of unnecessary visits, the use of a separate location of health institutions for children with flu symptoms.
At a significant rate of distribution in the local community, in addition to social exclusion strategies, long-term school absence measures may be considered. For law enforcement officials performing daily duties, direct health risks are considered to be low, in the opinion of the CDC.
Staff members of law enforcement authorities, who are obliged to contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of co-infection, are recommended to follow the same instructions as those prescribed for early-help supporters, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during detention, workers must clean and disinfect their formal belts and equipment before re-use by house cleaning aerosols or by disassembly, comply with standard operating procedures for preventing the spread of the disease and the use of used personal protective equipment, as well as for the use and use of clothes.
OSHA believes that some categories of health and soil workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk posts include medical assistance, support, laboratory and medical transportation personnel contacting patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected co-infection.
They have a very high risk of infection in the conduct of aerosol education procedures or in the collection/processing of samples from persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
Procedures accompanying aerosol education include screening, procedures for cassettes, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and surveys or sampling by invasive methods.
High-risk Mortgage Workers include staff working on human beings with confirmed disease or suspicion of co-infection at the time of their death; if such staff are exposed, they fall into a very high-risk category. Additional engineering and safety equipment for such risk groups include the use of isolated facilities for patients with confirmed disease or co-inspection, including in aerosol education procedures.
In some health and morgue institutions, special ventilation with negative pressure may be effective.
Tests should be carried out in accordance with the precautions for biological safety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be allocated to designated waiting areas, depending on the suspicions of co-infection. In addition to other personal protection, OSHA recommends that workers who work at a distance of up to 6 feet with patients with confirmed disease or suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as persons conducting aerosol education procedures, should be used.
In the United States, NIOSH approved respirators for N95 or higher-grade individuals should be used within the framework of an integrated written respiratory protection programme, which specifies the requirements for individual selection of funds and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort for the staff. WHO does not recommend the use of special care, as COVID-19 is a respiratory-borne disease, not due to physical fluids.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks should be used for patient-acquiring personnel.
WHO recommends wearing a surgical mask, protective eyes or protective screen for the face, pants and gloves for persons, persons who collect respiratory samples from patients with COVID-19 or those who carry this disease without procedures associated with aerosol education.
In the case of aerosol education procedures, a fan N95 or FFP2 should be carried instead of a surgical mask.
In view of the lack of individual protection resources around the world, WHO recommends that the need for such protection be minimized by the use of remote medical facilities, physical barriers, such transparent scars, access to a patient infected with COVID-19, only those who provide direct care, the use of only the personal protection resources required for a specific purpose, the use of the same longer-term while not taking away, in dealing with several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protection and the recommendation not to use masks for persons with no symptoms.

Theme: [Covid-19] Relief of load and preparation for the future
DATE/ DATE OF REVISION OF 14 March 2020, 00:00 UTC
DISCLOSURE: CC0: No protected rights
This month we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the relationships between people of the world and our responsibility to one another.
We have no precedents for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the ability to feel, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is the basis for such an organization.
We have observed friendly and caring relationships among all our colleagues, as reflected in electronic correspondence, phone calls and chats, a remarkable confirmation of the fact that fortunate people work with us.
I am very grateful and proud to speak of you as my colleagues.
Last week, I was told of the value of our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to approach Wikipedia right now and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And this is possible because of your work, whether it is to ensure the functionality of the sites, to pay our colleagues or to protect the safety of the communities.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, which is even more important today than ever before.
At that time, in order to achieve significant results for peace, it is not only what we do but also how we do it.
With regard to the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make significant changes in the way we work together, starting next week.
Adjusting the order of our work and timetables
As Robin said earlier, the "c-team" team gathered yesterday evening to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
During the communication, we considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during that period.
The overwhelming majority of us wanted to remove tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to step back, it'll be like that.
For all staff, contractors and temporary staff:
We expect to work around 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week before the next order.
We do not announce the dates of departure: if you can work normally for more hours, this will be permitted for the purpose of our mission.
However, the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs are, whether you are caring for your family, buying food, or going to the doctor’s office, your well - being is our priority number one.
We're not following your work hours.
If you're sick, you shouldn't work.
It's understandable and unquestionable, but we're talking about it.
There is no need to form a hospital letter or a response: just inform your manager and help the team review the calendar and schedule to ensure that the key areas are covered.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, report to Brian from T&C Ops, so that T&C can provide support and attention from the guidance to your situation).
The hourly rates will be paid in full.
We have already announced and confirmed our intention to comply with the obligations of our contractors and hourly staff.
Each person will be paid in accordance with normal hourly rates applicable under normal circumstances.
This means, in particular, periods of illness when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use work as a way to direct their efforts to the world around us.
What we do can bring wonderful results, especially at such times.
And again, it's about self-help.
We ask you to contact our leader so that we know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered essential.
We must always support such activities.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising (in addition to others) are doing critical work for which additional support may be required.
We are initiating a process for all units to assess the current objectives and to place emphasis on support, which is extremely important for our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we are just focusing on the most important projects.
The slowdown today does not mean a negative impact in the future.
We do not plan to work “two more to reverse the loss” after the end of the pandemic.
You will not need to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will work on setting new goals and deadlines, as far as possible.
What happens to the APP (annual plans)?
In order to build on the new reality and expectations of daily working time, we intend to adjust the deadlines for the implementation of our annual plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of the time limit for our 2019-2020 plan, thus providing more time for budgeting, which will allow staff to give priority to critical work, self-help and care for their loved ones, while providing a reduced schedule for all who need or want to work over the next few weeks.
This extension of the time limit significantly reduces the current planning and tension burden throughout the organization.
The following week, we will submit our proposal to the Council, provide relevant information to representatives and teams on the following steps immediately after receipt of the relevant confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for the leadership role in this work.
Status of office, risks and cleaning
Last week, we found out that one of our colleagues in San Francisco could be infected with a COVID-19 virus.
In addition to many precautions, however, we have hired an anti-virus cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces in the office in San Francisco.
They used anti-virus solutions of the medical class to disinfect all surfaces, as well as reception and elevator halls that allow access to our floor.
The building has its own rules that require caution with the use of products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared by the time we decide to return.
Our office in the province of Colombia (DC) is located on the WeWork network, which shared with us and all of the staff in the DC with its rules related to COVID-19.
Last week, our office in the province of Colombia fully moved to remote work in accordance with the instructions of San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the rent in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues work away for the first time.
Our old colleagues, who work far away, know about the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that meetings should be limited to one or two hours.
If necessary, consider the possibility of dividing them into a course of several days.
You will clearly define the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and the material for the first time.
By default, use video-links to facilitate interaction and communication using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
For convenience, designate a human coordinator who will track the input of the questions and monitor the list of speakers, as well as the person responsible for the conduct of the observations (or joint observation).
If necessary, contact the technical support service via e-mail.
Take advantage of the Wellness Reimbursement program when you buy snacks.
Join the channel #remotes in Slack to talk to colleagues about the distributed work.
The HR Operations team examines the guidance on ergonomics available in the form of webs to promote the effectiveness of distributed work throughout the organization.
Last week, we asked all recipients of Community grants to cancel the mass activities financed by Wikimedia, such as “editathons”, until the WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may lead to the impossibility of carrying out concerted grants activities, and no one will be punished for the delay or modification of such objectives.
Next week, we will conduct follow-up activities with additional guidance on Wikimania as well as other regional and thematic conferences of the community.
General attitudes in the global community are not only aggrieved by the interruption of work, but also some sense of relief from understanding and the possibility of focusing on their own communities, Wikimedia and not just themselves.
With regard to prospects, CRT is working on the Meta-Wiki page, which will provide space for the community to monitor impact and community.
We remain in touch with issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special meeting of staff to be held on Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07/00 PT.
This time we take the opportunity to further share relevant information, answer your questions, and spend time together, connecting with each other.
We are in such a situation together and ready to help everyone we can.
You can continue to receive information from such an electronic correspondence and other important information about COVID-19 from Office Wiki.
CRT will update such pages, and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working on maintaining regular communication with staff living in countries that have had a significant impact on the current situation.
In case of travel, activities, key workflows, information awareness issues or other assistance, contact the CRT.
We are ready to support and communicate as necessary.
In case of confidentiality issues, please contact the Director of HR International Global Operations by e-mail to Brian Judah (Bryan Judah).
No such change should be seen as a rejection of our work and our obligations.
Rather, it recognizes the current need for a radically new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support one another and to ensure that work continues, to provide the necessary support to our movement and to the whole world through the necessary service.
Our planning work will wait until the appropriate time.
Today is the time to support each other and to create space for an important work that is coming in the coming weeks and perhaps months.
To do so, we will need help from each one of you; and we need you to be able to care for yourself and your families, as well as to work with the greatest impact as soon as that need arises.
Now, please help your hands and do not touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the rest of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of the cell in light, arteries, hearts, hips and aquifers.
ACE2 opposes the activity of the relevant angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), reducing angiotensin-II content and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution to treat cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as a point of entry into cells for some coronary viruses.
The human version of the farm is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal enzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
Bellock ACE2 contains N-consumer peptide domain M2 and C-consumer transport domain of the renal amino acid collection.
ACE2 is a single pass membrane of type I, and its fermented active domain falls on the surface of the cells of light and other tissues.
ACE2 is separated from the transmembled domain by a different enzyme known as sedase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and finally released with urine.
ACE2 is present in most bodies: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most light type II alveolar cells, thin cough enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of most organs.
Biosynthesis ACE2 IRNC is also found in the main brain, striatum, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight of ACE.
ACE secretes the hormone angiotensin I into the adjacent angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, extracts the carbon dioxide contaminant from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into vasodilating angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also disperse a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apeline, neurosynthesis, dinomorphine A and grelin.
ACE2 also regulates the transport of a member carrier of the neutral amino acids SLC6A19 and is present in Hartnup's disease.
As a trans-embraced white, ACE2 is the primary point of entry into the cells for some coronary viruses, including HCV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus causing SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19).
Strictly speaking, binding of the S1 strain of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to a phermental domain of ACE2 on the surface of the cells leads to endocitosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzymes in the endosomals within the cells.
This entry also requires the administration of the S-cell serum protease TMPRSS2 protein, which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic agent, which has led some to the idea that reducing ACE2 levels in cells can help to fight infection.
However, many professional communities and regulators recommend continuing standard therapy by AFP and BRA inhibitors.
According to the systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012, “the use of AFP inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34 per cent compared to the control group”.
Furthermore, “pneumonia risk has also been reduced in patients receiving AFP inhibitors at higher risk, with pneumonia, especially in patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of PF-inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in pneumonia mortality, although the results were less reliable than those of patients at common pneumonia risk.”
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be a novelty in the treatment of severe mild injuries and appears to improve the leguminous hemodynamics and oxygen saturation of patients with acute respiratory failure syndrome caused by lipopolisacharides.
The human elimination half-life of rACE2 is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes apart from the duration of exposure at 24 hours.
Some data indicate that rACE2 can be a promising tool for people with a class-class renin-angiotensin-inhibitors (RAS-inhibitors) or with an increased circulation of angiotensin II. RACE2 was evaluated in clinical trials in the treatment of severe respiratory distress syndrome.
The COVID-19 Annexes are mobile applications intended to assist in the epidemiological investigation in the context of the pandemic of coronary virus 2019-20, i.e. the identification of persons (“contacts”) who could contact the infected person.
In some regions, a number of officially supported applications have been developed or proposed.
Several applications have been developed to track contacts.
This led to a discussion of confidentiality issues, especially those systems based on the geographical location of users of applications.
The softer options in this regard include the use of Bluetooth signals to register the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would unite their efforts to integrate the functional support of such applications through Bluetooth directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Government, together with Alipay, developed an annex that enables citizens to verify whether they interacted with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore uses an application called TraceTogether.
The application has been developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be transmitted under control to the Government. North Macedonia has launched the “StopKorona” application, working on Bluetooth, which helps track contacts with potentially infected people and ensures an operational link with health authorities.
The annex was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the annex was expected to register with Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking application was at the final stage of development and would be available for deployment within several weeks. Similar applications are planned to be launched in Ireland and France (StopCovid).
Australia and New Zealand are considering the use of applications based on the Singapore TraceTogether annex and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use an application with a geozoning function, which aims to ensure that patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis in Moscow do not leave their home.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security, Cambridge University, points out a number of potential practical problems that may arise with application systems, including counterfeiting and potential inefficiency if the application is used only by a small part of the population.
Given the concern about the proliferation of misleading or harmful “coronavirus” applications, Apple has limited the list of types of organizations that can offer their coronavirus-related annexes to the App Store, including only “official” or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon also imposed similar restrictions.
The participants of the privacy campaign expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance on the population through coronavirus-related applications; in particular, the question was raised whether the surveillance infrastructure created to combat the coronavirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappeared.
The International Amnesty Organization and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of such oversight.
The organizations announced eight conditions for their submission to public projects:
Monitoring should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
Increased monitoring and monitoring should be accompanied by reservations on the limitation of the duration of action;
The use of data should be limited to the purpose of combating the spread of COVID-19;
The security and anonymity of the data shall be protected and evidence of such protection shall be provided;
Digital surveillance should exclude cases of increased discrimination and marginalization;
Any exchange of data with third parties should be defined at the legislative level;
Protection against abuse should be guaranteed, as well as the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also published their lists.
Google and Apple offer their joint plan to address the problem of continuous monitoring, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their device operating systems as soon as it disappears.
In some countries, network tracking is used instead of annexes, which excludes the need to load the annex and the possibility to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network monitoring was approved.
Networks that have access to location data also have major potential issues of confidentiality.
However, not all central servers systems should have access to location personal data; a number of confidentiality systems have been developed that use central servers only for communications (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-application system was used as a basis for tracking contacts.
Instead of using the special annex, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including tracking mobile devices and transactions with maps, and then merged them to create notifications in the form of text messages sent to potential infected persons.
The Government not only used this information to warn citizens of potential contacts with the infected, but also made information on the location of the public available, which was possible due to significant changes in the protection of information legislation that had been introduced after the outbreak of MERS in that country.
Such information can be accessed through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralized and confidential systems.
As at 6 April 2020 details have not yet been published.
The monitoring of contacts where confidentiality is maintained is a strong concept, a significant amount of research literature dated at least in 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than ten expert groups worked on confidential solutions such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register the user's approach to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches and are not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include a decentralized transfer with confidentiality (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), protocols to ensure confidentiality, mechanisms to track mobile contacts (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for never leaving the device and all comparisons on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab, is involved in the development of SafePaths, a platform that ensures confidentiality in collecting and using data on location or cross-roads to track the spread of COVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on the research published in the “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintenance Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” document, published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, a company developing technologies for confidentiality, which was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware technologies to enable users to exchange confidential information about the location and health of other users and officials without risking the confidentiality of these data.
On 5 April 2020, groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols were founded by the TCN Global Coalition, which aims to reduce fragmentation and ensure global compatibility of tracking and warning applications, which is a key factor in their widespread dissemination.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used in its official annex.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control mobile platforms Android and iOS, announced a contact tracking initiative that, as they claimed, would ensure confidentiality, which is based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography to preserve confidentiality.
They also published technical characteristics of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system must be deployed in three stages:
deployment of tools to enable Governments to create official applications to track the movement of citizens infected with coronary virus, but to maintain confidentiality of data
By integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple are planning to solve problems with continuous monitoring, first by introducing the system by updating the operating system and then removing it in the same way after the threat has disappeared.
Rehabilitation of the medicinal product (also known as rehabilitating, rehabilitating, modifying or therapeutic rehabilitating) is rehabilitating the approved medicinal product for the treatment of a disease or medical condition different from the disease originally intended for development.
This is one of the areas of research currently being used to develop safe and effective methods of treatment of COVID-19.
Other studies include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transfer of recombinant plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 proteins that are affected by medicinal products, each of which has several binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites is an appropriate basis for the development of an effective anti-viral medicine against COPID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, gelicase, S protein and ADF-ribofosphatase.
Hussein AA and the co-authors in their pre-clinical study examined a number of candidates that were then optimized and analysed their similarity to the structure with the most similar approved products to accelerate the development of a highly effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 product, which will be recommended for clinical studies.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial agent that is also used to treat some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and associated hydroxychloroquine would be included in the four medicinal products studied in the clinical trial “Solidarity”.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Kuomo, announced that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine tests would start in the state of New York on 24 March. On 28 March FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate in accordance with an emergency application permit (USA).
The treatment scheme has not been approved during the FDA clinical trial and has been approved in accordance with the United States only as a pilot treatment for emergency care in patients who are hospitalized but are unable to receive treatment under the clinical trial regimens.
CDC stated that “use, dosing or duration of hydroxychloroquine to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 infection” has not yet been established.
Doctors say that they use the product when there is “no other way out”.
The Turkish research group in Istanbul conducted a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Major studies are conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The New York University Medical School in Langone examines the safety and effectiveness of the prevention of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Uhana and Shenzhen showed that Fawipirvir is “one-off”.
35 patients in Shenzhen who had taken this medicine had a negative result on average within 4 days, while 45 patients who had not taken it had 11 days of disease.
A study in Uhana was conducted in which 240 Pneumonia patients were monitored, one half of whom received favicirovir and the other half were myfenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Authority reminded the public that the results of the effectiveness of the product were poor and should not be considered final.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase a product in Japan to fill its stocks and that it would be delivered to university hospitals where the product would be used to treat patients with COVID-19 was used by military resources.
According to the South China Morning Post, Sindzo Abe informed the Thramp administration of the possibility of buying the product.
It may be dangerous for pregnant patients or for patients attempting to become pregnant.
A study on the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir (Caletera) antiviral drugs concluded that “the effectiveness of the use of the drugs has not been identified”.
Preparations have been developed to inhibit the response of HIV by binding to protease.
A group of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify medicinal products to find a combination that will be associated with the SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, there is a criticism of the re-profileization of medicinal products that have been specially developed for HIV and AIDS therapy.
WHO included the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the International Solidarity Test.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections. Later, Gilead scientists found that remdesivir has anti-virus activity in vitro with regard to the number of filo, pneumo, paramyxo and coronary viruses.
One of the challenges of anti-virus treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that may lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies show that remedesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance, and several clinical trials are currently being conducted, including two university clinics in Cleveland; one is conducted in patients with moderate disease and the other is in patients with more severe form.
Three internal vitamin C clinical trials are currently being conducted for people who are hospitalized with severe COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without placebo (Italy).
On 24 March 2020, an antibiotic test of azithromycin began in the state of New York.
The Japanese National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a clinical study of Alvesco (cyclosonid) Teijna, an inhalation corticosteroid for asthma treatment, for the purpose of its use in the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with new coronary virus.
Phase II test, the form of angiotensin converting enzyme 2, is conducted with the participation of 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria, hospitalized with severe forms of disease, to determine treatment effectiveness.
Researchers from the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and mild complications in patients with poorly pronounced COVID-19 symptoms.
For a study called COLCORONA, 6,000 adults 40 years of age and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 had mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant, breast-feeding and do not use effective contraceptives cannot participate in this study.
There are several coagulants in the test in Italy.
Low molecular heparin is widely used to treat patients, which has prompted the Italian Medicines Authority to publish recommendations on the use of this medicinal product.
On 14 April, a multicentre study involving 300 patients was announced in Italy on the use of enoxaparin sodium at preventive and therapeutic doses.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a significant scientific focus has been focused on retraining approved anti-virus products that have been developed for previous epidemics, such as Mers, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese recommendations.
Umifenevir: Umifenevi was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese recommendations
Some antibiotics that have been considered potentially suitable for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
Tests also in Italy and China, see tocilizumab#COVID-19.
COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronary virus in 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has undergone clinical trials, numerous attempts to develop such a vaccine continue to be made.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it was not expected that the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine could be obtained earlier than 18 months later.
Five vaccine candidates conducted Phase I safety studies in April.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of this disease spread around the world, resulting in significant investments in the development of the vaccine and research activities in its context.
Many organizations use published genomics to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI Vaccine Development Initiative are to ensure the necessary speed, production capacity, widespread deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI researchers reported that in early 2020 there were 10 different technological platforms to establish an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the Platforms included in the Phase I security study:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (stage I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, IRNA-1273)
virus vector (stage I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, adenvirus vector type 5)
As reported by CEPI in April, 115 potential vaccines are in early stages of development, 78 of which are used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute); in addition, 37 more candidates have been declared, but there is little public information available (probably, at planning or development stages).
Phase I-II pre-tests for safety and immunogenicity are usually randomized, placebo-controlled, and several sites with more accurate and effective doses at the same time.
Phase III of the tests usually involves more participants, including the control group; at this stage, preparations are tested for disease prevention and side effects are monitored at optimal doses.
Of the 79 candidates in active development (as confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested per person (are still in pre-clinical studies).
On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was exploring the potential of a molecular tumor vaccine that genetically modified viral proteins to stimulate immune response.
On 24 January 2020, the International Centre for Vaccines (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced the start of work on its own vaccine in order to start testing on people in 2021.

Janssen and his Biotechnology Partner Vaxart are developing an oral vaccine.
On 18 March 2020, Emergency BioSolutions announced a production partnership with Vaxart to develop a vaccine.
OncoGen in Romania, on 8 February 2020, published a paper on the development of a technology vaccine similar to that used for the vaccination against neo-cancer cancer.
On 25 March, the head of the Research Institute announced the completion of the vaccine synthesis and the initiation of tests.
On 27 February 2020, Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that a project to develop a peptide Ii-Key vaccine against COVID-19 was under way.
Their aim was to develop a vaccine candidate product that could be tested on people within 90 days.
On 5 March 2020, the University of Washington, St. Louis, announced its projects for the development of a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Medical Research and Material Protection Army, Fort Detrick, and Walter Reed, Silver Spring, a research army in the western part of Maryland, announced that they were developing their vaccine.
On 10 March 2020, the Emergency Biosolutions announced that it had entered into partnership with Novavax Inc.
for the development and production of the vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for phase I pre-clinical trials and clinical trials by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they are studying 11 isolated patients, and that even in the early phase of vaccine development, at least half a year will be required.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotech company, Quebec, reported that they had a particle-like coronavirus in partial funding from the Canadian Institute of Health Studies.
The potential vaccine is being tested in laboratories and testing in humans is scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that the President of the United States, Donald Trump, proposed CureVac “large sums of money” for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, against which the German Government protested.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced that a partnership with the German company BioNTech had been established for the joint development of an IRNC vaccine.
BNT162 is a candidate for an IRNC vaccine; the product is currently undergoing preclinical tests and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020, Italian biotechnology company Takis Biotech announced that in April 2020 it would receive the results of pre-clinical tests, and their final vaccine candidate could start testing for people by autumn.
On 19 March 2020, the Innovation Coalition for Epidemics (CEPI), France, announced investment of $4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine consortium with the participation of the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the Pittsburgh University. The overall CEPI investment in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine is $29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovo, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists began testing six different candidates for animal vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College, London, announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-implicated COVID-19 RNA vaccine.
The vaccine candidate has been developed within 14 days of obtaining consistency from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced the allocation of $275 million to 96 research projects on health countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine products in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At the same time, for example, the Canadian Government announced the allocation of 192 million Canadian dollars specifically to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, as well as plans for the establishment of a national vaccine bank, where several new vaccines could be used in the event of a new outbreak of coronary virus.
On 2 April 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported that PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, stated that “MNA introduced subunitary vaccines SARS-CoV-2 S1, with strong responses to anti-specific antibodies [in mice] that occurred two weeks after immunization”.
On 16 April 2020, the Canadian School of Pharmaceuticals of the University of Waterloo announced the development of a potential vaccine based on DNA, which may be released in the form of a nascent strain.
The DNA bacteria will reproduce within human bacteria and produce harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the Government, industry and three U.S. universities pooled IBM supercomputers' resources together with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have other benefits beyond the disease prevention properties.
Another randomized study in Australia covers 4170 health workers.
Vaccines developed may prove unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies on the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models characterized by COVID-19, such as ACE2-transmitted mice, other laboratory animals and low-primes, indicate the need for biosafety 3 control measures in the treatment of live viruses, as well as international coordination of standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested on animal models.
As of 2020, there are no medicinal products or protective vaccines to treat SARS, which would be safe and effective for people.
According to the research work published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicinal products for the treatment of atypical pneumonia was a priority for Governments and public health institutions around the world.
When MERS was started, it was considered that the SARS study, which was then carried out, could be a standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one MES (DNA-based) vaccine that passed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines, all of which were virus-based vaccines and were in the process of development, two adenviruses (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
In social networks, the conspiracy theory was based on the fact that the COVID-19 virus is not new and that the vaccine already exists.
Social media publications quoted the words of some patients who claimed that there were patents for the genetic sequences of other strains of the coronary virus, such as the SARS coronavirus, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), which is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include nausea, cough and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include feeling tired, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of color, and pain in life.
The time from the first onset of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also range from two to fourteen days.
Most cases are associated with mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease flows into viral pneumonia and polyorganization.
As of 17 April 2020, over 2.24 million cases of infection were reported in 210 countries and regions, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered, and the virus is mainly spread by close contact with each other, often through microscopic drops of air in cough, cough, or conversation.
Although these chapels are formed when ventilated, they usually pose a threat, either to the ground or to the surface, but not to air at long distances.
People are also infected with contaminated surfaces and then their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can live on the surface for 72 hours.
It is the most infected during the first three days after symptoms occur, although its spread may be possible both before symptoms occur and at later stages. The standard diagnostic method is a polymeric chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (RT-PCR) on a sample taken as a bone marrow.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients with suspected disease, as well as for those who follow them.
The recommendations for the use of medical masks are different: some authorities recommend not to use them at all, some recommend their use, and others require them.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment of the COVID-19 virus.
Local distribution of the disease has been registered in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infectious people may have no symptoms or flu symptoms, such as nausea, cough, fatigue and swelling.
Extreme symptoms include difficulty in breathing, persistent pain or feeling depressed in the chest, loss of consciousness, difficulty in awakening, face or loss; if the above symptoms are present, medical attention should be sought immediately.
Symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease, such as sneezing, nausea, or throat pain, may rarely be observed.
In addition, different percentage ratios have been observed in lactating and lactating symptoms, such as nausea, redness, and diarrhoea.
Some cases of disease registered in China were initially only evidenced by a feeling of chest depression and heart failure.
In some cases, disease can progress by developing pneumonia, a polyorganized deficiency, resulting in death.
This is called the incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period is usually five to six days, but may range from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, symptoms begin to occur within 11.5 days of infection, and according to available data, symptoms do not occur in all infected people.
The role of such unsymptomatic carriers in the transmission of the disease is not yet fully known, but the preliminary data show that they can contribute to the spread of infection.
The percentage of people infected with the unsymptomatic disease is currently unknown and is only studied; Korean disease control and prevention centres (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations related to the virus during the disease were unsymptomatic.
The National Health Commission of China began to include unsymptomatic cases in its daily summary on 1 April; of the 166 cases of infection registered on that day, 130 (78%) were rejected at the time of the test.
Both wet and mucous membranes can have a high virus concentration.
In the case of louder words in the air, more drops are given than in the case of normal louder words.
The study conducted in Singapore showed that the caps can be extended at a distance of up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).
The virus is usually not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that the transfer of particles of the virus to bioaerosols is possible, and the testing of air processed by air collectors in corridors outside the human room has shown that there is a virus RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular resuscitation (SDRs), may lead to the spread of respiratory products and therefore to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also fears that the virus can spread through the faecal, however, this risk is considered low. The virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible even before symptoms occur, but this risk is low.
Officials of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) claim that until it is quite clear how easily the virus is spread, however, it is known that one patient usually infected 2-3 other people; the virus can survive on the surface for several hours to a few days.
In particular, it was found that the virus was able to live within one day, on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on a stainless steel (AISI 304), up to three days and 99 per cent of the copper surface, up to 4 hours.
These indicators, however, vary depending on the humidity and temperature.
Lime and molars, when properly used, have a useful effect in the fight against infection: it destroys a solid protective layer of the virus, deactivating it, as well as being able to remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexide gluconate (surgical disinfectant), are less effective against this virus. During the study conducted in Hong Kong, spleen samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and in the sixth patient the highest level of the virus in the blood was detected on the second day of the test.
The severe severe respiratory coronary syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe severe coronary respiratory syndrome, the first three persons with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Uchana.
All of the signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in coronal strains.
While outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by a home mill that conceals its protective cover. SARS-COV-2 is closely related to the baseline SARS-COV.
Mild is the body most affected by COVID-19, as the virus penetrates into the host cell through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most common in type II light alveolar cells.
The virus is combined with ACE2 and penetrates into the host cell using a characteristic surface glycoprotein, “ship” (peplomer).
12 per cent of the infected people hospitalized in Uhana have been diagnosed with severe myocardial infarction, which is more frequent in severe illness.
The frequency of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders observed during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large numbers, as they participate in the work of this body.
The high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was observed in patients in the OIT with COVID-19 and may be evidence of adverse forecasts. The autopsy of patients who died from COVID-19 showed the presence of diffuse alveolar injury (ADD) and lymphocytes containing inflammatory infiltrates in light.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism with ACE2-expressing respiratory respiratory cells, symptoms of systemic hyper-inflammation have been observed in patients with severe COVID-19.
In particular, it was found that pathogens of GM-CSF T-cells were correlated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes that gave IL-6 and a severe pathology for patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates were also detected at the opening.
WHO has also published several test protocols for this disease.
The real-time polymeric chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a standard test method.
The test is usually carried out on breathable samples obtained from the bone marrow, but the nose or wet tissue may also be used.
The results are usually prepared for a period of several hours to two days.
Blood tests may also be performed, but they require two samples of blood taken every two weeks, and their results are of no direct importance.
Chinese scientists have been able to assign coronavirus strains and publish their genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can develop tests on their own by means of polymeric chain reaction (PCR) to detect the presence of the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests that could detect infection at the current time, as well as possible infection in the past, were under development but have not yet been widely disseminated.
China ' s experience in examining the results of the tests showed that their accuracy was only between 60 and 70 per cent.
On 21 March 2020, the U.S. Food Quality Control Office (FDA) approved the first on-the-spot diagnostic test that allowed it to be applied at the end of this month.
The bilateral multi-purpose sub-floor focusses of mating glass with peripheral, asymmetric and a posterior distribution are common symptoms identified at the early stage of the disease.
Subsequent domination, a symptom of a bile bridge (departure of the barrier with a variable alveolar filling) and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
There are few data on microscopic damage and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main results of the pathological study carried out in the field of detection:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, swelling and swelling of the
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
Pneumonia mild: fluctuations of light, hyperplasia of pneumocytes, major atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multi-nuclear giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar injury (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exodus.
DAD is the cause of severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxaemia.
Pneumonia: the organization of alveolar discharges and the leguminous interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: diffuse intra-consistency conversion (DVS syndrome); lecoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include home dwelling, avoiding people ' s places, frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, compliance with respiratory hygiene rules, and avoiding eye, nose or mouth unwashed.
CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a walnut or walnut, or, in the absence of a walnut, covering the mouth and nose of the inner side of the walnut zone.
It is recommended that, after coughing or coughing, a high-quality hand hygiene procedure be conducted.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue masks in public places, in particular with a view to limiting the transmission of disease-free individuals. Social distance strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; these measures have closed schools and enterprises, limited the movement of citizens and large public activities have been abolished.
Distance recommendations also mean that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There is no confirmed efficacy against COVID-19 since the completion of the vaccine is expected not earlier than 2021, most of the measures against the spread of COVID-19 are associated with a reduction in the peak of the epidemic known as “platinum output”.
CDC also recommends more frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after a visit to the toilet or during severe hand pollution, as well as before and after swallowing, coughing or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends the use of a disinfectant containing alcohol (the alcohol content is at least 60 per cent) but only where the soap and water are not available. In areas where such disinfectants are not sold, WHO provides two recipes for local production.
These compounds use ethanol or isopropanol with antimicrobial activity.
Water supply is used to eliminate bacterial alcohol disputes and is not an appropriate tool for antiseptic treatment.
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients have been shown to be supportive of therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, as well as support for other vital organs affected.
CDC recommends that those suspected of being infected with the virus wear a normal medical mask.
The extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory insufficiency, but its benefits are still being studied.
In order to strengthen immunity, it is recommended that personal hygiene, healthy lifestyle and diet be observed.
The supportive methods of treatment can be seen in patients with mild symptoms at early stages of the disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China issued recommendations on care for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, physicians for intensive therapy and pulmonologists summarized the therapeutic recommendations of the various institutions for free resources, IBCC.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment of COVID-19 is available.
For the treatment of symptoms as first-line medicinal products, some medical professionals recommend making a choice for paracetamol (acetamine) compared to ibuprofen.
Caution should be exercised in the conduct of procedures where air-capillary emissions, such as intubation or dry hands, to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in medical facilities.
CDC recommends that medical personnel who are dealing with COVID-19 should be placed in an air-capable insulator (AIIR) in addition to standard contact and air-conditioning precautions. CDC issued recommendations on the use of individual protective equipment (SIZ) during the pandemic.
The recommended means of individual protection: a protective coat, a breather or a medical mask, an eye protection device and a medical device. Of the above means, it is preferable to use a breather rather than a medical mask.
The N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has permitted the use of these respirators in accordance with the emergency application permit (UA).
They are designed to protect from particles in the air, such as dust, but the effectiveness of the protection against the specific biological agent is not guaranteed when the instructions are not used.
If medical masks are not available, CDC recommends using protective face screens or, in the end, making masks on their own in domestic conditions.
In most cases, the flow of COVID-19 is not difficult enough to require the artificial ventilation of light or alternative, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory insufficiency associated with COVID-19 is currently being studied actively, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided by means of an intensive airflow or double-level positive airway.
Whether one of these two ways for patients in a critical state is as effective as the IDA is not yet known.
Some doctors make a choice for the invasive mechanical ventilation of light, if available, because this method significantly restricts the spread of particulate matter in the air compared to the nasal ducts with intensive air flow. The risk of severe disease for older people (those over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age) is much higher.
In many developed countries, hospitals are not enough for the population, and health systems are too limited to deal with a sharp increase in the number of COPID-19 infections in a severe form that requires hospitalization.
As a result of one study in China, 5% of patients were hospitalized in intensive therapy, 2.3% needed mechanical support for light ventilation and 1.4% had been completed.
In China, approximately 30 per cent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually re-enacted.
The task of providing artificial ventilation for the light is complex, as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developing with COVID-19 is increasing and oxygen is causing more problems.
Inhaled and PVC-supported HlVs are needed to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen to the light and to ensure their minimum ventilation damage, which may result in the development of pneumotorex.
In earlier models, high PKVs may not be available.
Potential methods of treatment were started in January 2020 and several antivirals are currently in the course of clinical trials.
Remedesivir appears to be the most promising.
The development of new medicinal products may take up to 2021, but some of the products tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of the tests.
Antivirals may be tested in patients with severe disease.
The recommended WHO volunteers participate in the effectiveness and safety tests of potential treatment methods. The FDA provided temporary authorisation for the use of recombinant plasma as a experimental treatment in cases where human life is at risk of serious or direct danger.
Its application was not subject to clinical studies to be conducted to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the treatment method.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to combat the outbreak of the disease.
In order to enter, users must enter their name and identification number.
The Annex may identify “close contact” by means of monitoring data and therefore identify the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the potential risk is identified, the annex not only recommends self-insulation, but also provides a notification to local health authorities. Analysis of large data collected from mobile phones, identification technology, tracking mobile phones and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and the persons they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government authorized security authorities to track the mobile phones of people allegedly infected with coronary virus.
Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who may enter into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to study and prevent the spread of the Deutsche Telecom virus, the Federal State Institutions and Robert Koha Institute provided aggregated data on the location of hundreds of subscribers.
In Russia, identification technology for quarantine offenders was introduced.
The Regional Health Commissioner of Italy, Julio Gallera, said that hundreds of network operators reported that “40 per cent of people are still moving abroad”.
The Government of Germany conducted a 48-hour programming marathon, involving more than 42,000 participants.
The President of Estonia, Kersty Kaluloyd, also called for creative solutions against the spread of the coronary virus.
People may experience anxiety due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: “Strengthened social isolation, loneliness, concern about health, stress and economic decline – ideal conditions for harming people’s mental health and well-being”.
The disease can flow easily with minor or missing symptoms that remind other common upper respiratory diseases, such as normal cold.
Patients with a mild form of disease are usually cured within two weeks, while patients with severe or critical forms may need three to six weeks to be treated.
Pregnancy women may be at a higher risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19 based on data on other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although such data on COVID-19 are not available. Some people may have mild strokes and may cause pneumonia as a complication.
In people with the most severe duration of the COVID-19 disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory insufficiency, septic shock or polyorganic insufficiency may progress rapidly.
The COVID-19 complications include sepsis, anomalous thrombosis, and heart, wells and bakery problems.
Thromboform abnormalities, especially prothrombin time increases, were reported in 6 per cent of patients entering the COVID-19 hospital, while the failure of the wait function was observed in 4 per cent of the group.
About 20-30% of patients with COVID-19 had elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was 10 days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to intensive therapy was seven days.
Early-stage disease studies have shown that the mean time from onset of symptoms to death was 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the rate of mortality among men was 2.8 per cent and among women was 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological studies of mutagenic specimens suggest a diffuse alveolar injury with cell fibromyxoid exodus in both minors.
The pneumocytes had viral cytopathetic changes.
An external type of easy-to-use severe respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS) has been recalled.
In 11.8 per cent of the deaths recorded by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were associated with increased tropics or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had health problems; access to medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region could also affect mortality.
The mortality estimates vary according to the condition due to such regional differences and due to methodological difficulties.
A poorly effective calculation of cases can lead to an increase in mortality.
However, the fact that death occurs as a result of previous diseases may mean that the current level of mortality is underestimated.
In smokers, severe COVID-19 symptoms were generally developed 1.4 times more frequently, and such patients needed approximately 2.4 times more intensive treatment or died than non-smokers; concerns were expressed about the long-term effects of the disease.
The administration of a Hong Kong clinic found that some patients who were cured of the disease had a slight decrease of 20-30 per cent and had a scan of their injuries.
After recovery, this may also lead to the syndrome “After intensive therapy”.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether the patient's persistent immunity against the virus was being developed.
In the case of other coronaviruses, this was considered likely, but also reported when positive coronavirus tests were performed after the treatment of COVID-19.
In these cases, it is believed that there has been a prolonged period of disease rather than a recurrence of infection.
The virus is believed to be natural, has animal origin and is an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of infection was almost entirely due to its transmission from human to human.
A study of the first 41 COVID-19 cases, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, calls the first case on 1 December 2019 the earliest date of the disease.
According to the official data published by WHO, this date is 8 December 2019.
Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary according to the region and the spread of the disease, and they also affect the levels of testing, the quality of health systems used in treatment schemes, the time since the outbreak of the disease and the population parameters, such as age, gender and overall health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO attributed the Emergency Aid Codes to ICB-10: U07.1 — for deaths from laboratoryly confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 — for deaths from clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 — the proportion of deaths and infections is divided into the number of diagnosed cases over a period of time.
According to statistics from the University of Jones Hopkins, as at 17 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9 per cent (153 822/2 240 191).
This figure varies according to the region. Some other methods include the definition of the disease mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who have died from the disease, and the definition of the death rate as a result of the transmitted infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who have died from the disease.
These statistics do not relate to a specific time period and reflect the indicators of a certain population from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Although antibodies are not produced in all infected patients, the presence of such antibodies may indicate how many people have been infected.
In the epicenter of blasts in Italy, Castilone d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4600, 80 people (1.7%) are no longer living.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease spread among young people during the celebration, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population may have antibodies, according to donor blood.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population).
The impact of pandemics and levels of mortality is different for men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the level of mortality was higher than that of men.
The highest risk group is men over 50 years of age; the gap between men and women is reduced by only 90 years of age.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for this difference are unknown but may be genetic and behavioral factors.
Gender immunological differences, the lower prevalence of smoking among women associated with men's diseases (e.g. hypertension in men younger than in women) may lead to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of the infected were male, and 72 per cent of the deaths from COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the United States Government is not conducting gender statistics on COVID-19.
Research has shown that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and ORVI, have different gender statistics.
Most health workers, especially nurses, are women, respectively, more likely to be infected.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
WHO leader, Mr. Tedros Adanam Gebreísus, explains: “CO” means “corona”, “VI” – “virus”, “D” – “disease” and “19” when the first outbreak was detected: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid a reference to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or groups of people, as required by international recommendations for the prevention of stigmatization. The virus, which causes COVID-19, is called a severe acute coronary respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
In WHO's public communications, the terms “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 virus” are further used.
And the disease, and the virus itself, is usually called coronavirus.
During the initial outbreak in Uhana, China, the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as “coronavirus” and “Uhank crownvirus”.
In January 2020, according to the 2015 recommendations for geographical use of the names of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended using the terms “fast respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCOV” as temporary names of the virus and disease.
Official names “COVID-19” and “SARS-COV-2” were published on 11 February 2020.
Because of the limitations on the standard supply chains, some digital service manufacturers print medical material, such as bone marrow swabs, as well as the details of IVL devices.
In one of these cases, the Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required time limit, when one of the local productions was re-profiled and able to print the necessary 100 valves per night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, various theories of conspiracy, disinformation and pheasant information on the origin of the virus, its size, prevention, treatment and other aspects became widely available on the Internet.
It's possible that humans can infected other animals with the virus.
The results of the studies did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, rats and rats.
There is currently no approved vaccine from the virus or medicinal products for its treatment.
Various international studies on vaccines and medicinal products from COVID-19 are currently being carried out by governmental organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the WHO initiated the SOLIDARIITY Trial (SOLIDARITY Test) programme, which aims to assess the therapeutic effect of the four existing compounds that are the most effective to date.
The vaccine is not yet available, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are entering human cells using the ACE2 receptor, and the results of previous studies carried out under SARS-CoV are therefore used in scientific development.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers are trying to establish a full virion vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to trigger a rapid immune response of the human body to the new infection COVID-19.
The second strategy, the establishment of a subunital vaccine, is aimed at the establishment of a vaccine, which increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are aimed at the destruction of the S-chip protein that helps the virus penetrate into the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the development of a vaccine based on nucleic acid (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new method for the establishment of a vaccine).
Experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine was started in Seattle for four volunteers.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antithelosis has been identified as a potential problem in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are being conducted.
Preparations approved for malaria treatment were evaluated during seven tests, four of which were hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The re-enrolment of anti-virus drugs is a major part of Chinese studies; nine Phase III remedesivir studies were conducted in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 was carried out. To this end, several other existing antivirals for the treatment of COVID-19, including reddissevir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with beta interferon, were also considered.
As of March 2020, there are preliminary data on the effectiveness of the use of remedesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients receiving remedesivir as an exception.
Phase III of clinical trials are already taking place in the United States, China and Italy. The use of chloroquine previously used for malaria treatment was considered in China in February 2020, and preliminary results are available.
Nevertheless, there is a need for an expert assessment of the study.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend that chloroquins be used.
The Uhanian Institute of Virusology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that double the dose is very dangerous and can lead to a fatal outcome.
On 28 March 2020, FDA granted an emergency authorisation for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine by physicians treating patients with COVID-19. China's 7th edition also cited interferon, ribavirin or umifenequine as an antidote to COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanid was recommended for a detailed in vivo study demonstrating the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in low concentrations. Studies have shown that induction of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor requires the administration of a pre-emeded serum 2 (TMPRSS2).
Studies on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azitromycin have severe limitations that do not allow the medical community to use these treatment methods without any further study. Ozeltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytokinaemia may occur as a delay in the late stages of a severe form of COVID-19.
There are confirmations that hydroxychloroquine may have hypercytokinaemia properties, as a result of a small study conducted by the National Health Commission of China, tocilizumab was included in the recommendations for the treatment of coronary viruses.
This medicinal product was achieved at 2 stages of a national test conducted in Italy after positive results were obtained in patients with severe disease.
In conjunction with the ferritin blood flow analysis for the detection of cytokines, it is intended to counteract factors that are considered to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, FDA was approved as an interlequin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective thematic studies to treat the release syndrome of steroid refractory cytokines caused by another cause, T-cell therapy CAR.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine-release syndrome.
Transfers of cleaned and concentrated antibodies produced by immune systems of patients cured from COVID-19 are currently considered as a non-vaccinal method of passive immunization.
The strategy was tested in the treatment of patients with SARS, but its results were uncertain.
Virus neutralisation is a expected effect that allows passive antibody therapy to protect against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may also be used.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are at the development stage.
It may be possible to increase the level of use of a recombinant blood clot, which consists of a liquid part of the blood of the healed patients and contains antibodies to the virus.
