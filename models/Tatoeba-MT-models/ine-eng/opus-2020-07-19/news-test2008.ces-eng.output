Inflation in Europe leaped for food
The acceleration of inflation in the euro area is due, in particular, to a steady rise in food prices.
The November price increase in the 13 euro area countries was higher than expected, with an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent registered by 2.6 per cent in October, the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the Union announced.
The official forecast suggested only 3 percent, announced by Bloomberg.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian emission banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not reduce the basic interest rate by reducing, together with rising raw materials prices and reducing unemployment, the rise in inflation spirals.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below two percent, however close to them.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: inflation needs to be "absolute" so that it does not have to do anything later in this matter.
In Germany, November inflation represents 3.3 per cent of the 15-year record; then in Spain it rose from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation in the euro area has erupted due to rising food and energy prices.
Terminator prices of wheat stood at 88 per cent, and the soybean price also reached the highest values since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and dairy products.
Oil prices on world markets fell by 52 per cent this year, and last month one barrel of black gold was already worth nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will increase in 2008 from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate will continue to remain at approximately 3 per cent in the next 3-4 months, although its average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees the government crisis
The group of supporters of the Fidesz movement has grown significantly since the ongoing stagnation to the beginning of December, and has now been in the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of the Gallup Institute's Socialists, the 13% of the aid has never yet been planned.
In the case of certain parties' wishes, the difference - due to the greater determination of the opposition's wishes - would represent more than two-thirds (71%) of support against the five MSZP support.
The MDFs and SZDSZ are, according to the survey, under the threshold for entry into Parliament: their support for the entire population is two per cent.
Among certain party voters, the proponents of both camps are one percent more.
The public's view of the economy has also worsened in view of the previous minimum - it has never been the ratio of those who consider the economic situation of the country to be very poor, so high - 41 per cent, while according to the remaining 46 per cent, the situation is quite bad.
Families assessing their material situation after the spring and summer hopeful prospects are now more pessimistic.
As for the next year, it will count most of the population with further deterioration and only tens with improvement.
In December, 71% of respondents were judged, most of all of Gallup's current research at the Institute, that the prime minister is doing his work worse than good.
Ference Gyurcsány believes or very believes 13 percent of the respondents, while Victor Orbán shares 38 percent of the beneficiaries.
The prime minister doesn't even believe 54 per cent, the President of the Fidesz movement 27 per cent.
One of the indicators of political development is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be solved without a change in the government.
While, after last October's disturbances, the government and prime minister have considered the suspension of 35 per cent, the current rate is only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) see the solution only in the election of new elections.
In the interest of the referendum, it is noted that 60 per cent of the respondents answered the question of their possible participation, that it would certainly come and another 20 per cent announced that it would probably come.
For comparison, "parliamentary elections scheduled this week" would certainly involve only 55 per cent and another 15 per cent consider their participation likely. The success of the referendum would be beyond doubt on the basis of the current intentions.
Schoolers would be told not to 74, doctors' fees 79, and hospital stays 84 percent.
If we look at the same shares only in the circle of people who certainly promise their participation, then the introduction of school fees, doctors' fees and hospital stay fees would be 81, 84, and 89 percent.
The dearest is Auchan, almost five of Tesco's
The hypermarkets in the Buddhist trading triangle maintained last year, on average 16% of the price level, with the difference that this year there was no increase in VAT.
Article of the journal Napi Masterság
The usual Christmas consumable of Napi Myság's journal in the Budaor's trading triangle grew by 16 per cent this year, although in all hypermarkets, there was a significant increase in the price over thousands of forints.
Since the prices in the supermarkets of food "flights" are already in December, as a percentage of the previous high base has not appeared to be so drastic.
For the consumer, however, it is certainly unpleasant that what could have been bought at a price below nine thousand forints will not be arranged now for ten thousand.
The consumption basket of the daily economy in the tested hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of at least ten thousand forints by 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003 there was a consumption basket of 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unica and the living fish remained almost at last’s level, although they were very careful about the cruel breasts, nuts and also worms.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although we found in Auchan a pound of bread even for 139 forints.
The competition did not go with the price of the product under 200 forints.
It was also surprising in this shop that the price of two litres of Coca Coly in the bottle was below 200 forints, so only 257 forints were made in stock.
However, this year he appeared according to the consumption basket of Napi Masterság Auchan as the most expensive, while Cora as the cheapest.
According to our brochures, prices in the consumer basket of Napi Masterság rose by 15, while Tesco and Auchan were around 18% in February.
When comparing last year's highest and this year's lowest value of the basket, the difference was 12 per cent, while the increase between last year's lowest and this year's highest was 21 per cent.
In the United States there was an increase of 1,480.
The average increase in the price of February was 1,206 forints, with prices being affected by the rise of VAT on Christmas.
It is precisely this process that has disrupted the trade, commercial houses have obviously not been able to decide how large price ranges are to be determined in individual products as they have not been able to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If the trader plans the speed of the turnover of the product concerned wrong, a significant profit may be achieved due to the price range adapted to the intensity of the turnover.)
Due to VAT, the rise in the price of Napi Myság’s consumer basket was so extreme that the price of the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006, while the cheapest made the price difference of 844 forints.
This year the final difference did not appear, the dearest basket now stood by 1,630 forints more than February and also the cheapest one by 1,284 forints.
In comparison with the two Christmas season, there has been a catastrophic price increase, and in less than 20 months the daily consumption in hypermarkets has risen by more than 30 per cent.
(However, this does not fully confirm the Central Statistical Office's data: in the case of a few basic foods, the price increase of more than 30 per cent over 12 months was determined by the Central Statistical Office.
Other than flours, for example, in the case of eggs.)
However, in the latter case, according to the consumption basket of the Daily Economy, it seems almost impossible because the price level of the product, quite expensive already in last year, has proved to be the basis even in the worst case of price growth of almost 10 per cent.
Suppliers of flours take a stronger position than suppliers of eggs, and have also been able to place drastic price increases in international chains.
Hypermarkets in a gold triangle do not complain, they still refer to a good year.
According to our experience, most customers in the three visited stores are no longer interested in the price.
They buy everything, they buy the quantity, they get the sustainable food on the payroll.
On Wednesday morning, in all three supermarkets, long fronts were created at the store, as the number of visitors grew rapidly.
However, as we know, the trend on the outside is lower, more and more international networks are complaining to research companies that the markets remain behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of sustainable consumer goods.
In many places it is stored in disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand cases of infection have been reported in hospitals mainly due to inadequate use of antibiotics.
Hygienic conditions in patients, overcrowding of beds, overload of staff do not help to stop the disease, claims prime minister of the National Epidemiological Centre.
In many places, they also store in disinfectants.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed at the traumatological department of St. John's Hospital.
Bacteria resistant to antibiotics were found in a man who was hospitalized after a serious transport accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the same place at the beginning of the year.
A patient injured in a serious car accident was released at home, however soon after he had to return with MRSA infection and due to the bacteria in his body, one important operation has not yet been performed.
By 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant diseases were reported to the National System of Nesocomialis Surveillance, said Karolina Böröčová, the primary of the National Epidemiological Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant diseases have been registered in hospitals with certainty, others are not known.
Nearly two thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacilin with a resistant golden staphylococcal.
Bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (SA) carries a third of the people in the nose without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. inflammation of the liver, inflammation of the jaw, skin infection, infection of the wound) respond well to antibiotics and are treated well.
However, if antibiotics are administered to an excessive or inappropriate extent, the bacteria that react well to the antibiotics will develop, which is very resistant to antibiotics and which is rapidly spreading under inadequate hospital conditions.
In particular, in the case of transient or persistent malfunction of the immune system in patients with a weakened body, low body weight or in patients over the years, serious hospital infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning - sepsis may occur.
According to the senior physician of St. John's Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, similar infections in hospitals for daily practice.
"The infection must not be replaced by an epidemic, MRSA is not only there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of the cause of the disease is not examined."
Refused to Antibiotics
"We isolate these patients, treating them in rubber gloves and in masks and for their treatment we need antibiotics," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to the hospital are examined in advance whether MRSA is present in their body, nor can the infection be avoided at all times.
Selection of sample is not in fashion
The overwhelming majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, however, the current conditions and conditions in home hospitals are not for the prevention of the development and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröčová.
As this infection is reportedly occurring in hospitals and nursing homes, patients treated should monitor and immediately isolate MRSA carriers.
However, the sampling of microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not in fashion.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance this investigation.
Most cases are so exposed if the patient suffers from the detectable MRSA infection, the primary epidemiological centre said.
The European Union has strong recommendations for the appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
It is necessary to seek to be targeted for antibiotic therapy, or a microbiological examination should be carried out to prevent the development of resistance to medicines, however, not to be observed in all cases.
The sampling of microbiological samples is even more frequent in the primary, respective, outpatient treatment of patients, has been reported by Karolina Böröčová.
It's being investigated on disinfectants.
According to scientific evidence, MRSA spreads among patients most frequently through medical personnel.
Therefore, it plays a very important role in washing hands and using gloves and masks, although there are serious deficiencies in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by capella infection and touch, but under the conditions of home patients, it is not always possible to isolate infected patients.
On the contrary, rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close to themselves, although from an epidemiological point of view patients should be at least 1.5 meters away.
As Karolina Böröczová noted, unfortunately, we can also meet with the fact that in hospitals that are in an adverse material situation, they are looking at disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients, which are still increasing the chance of infection.
According to Karolina Böröčová, there is where the necessary protective measures, similar infections manifestly less or another spread of the cause of the disease can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection represents enormous expenditure for health insurance, therefore fighting it everywhere.
For example, in England, the government has written down the MRSA prevention programme and reduced its appearance.
The programme appears to be successful, according to the published data, they show a decreasing trend of MRSA infection in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is responsible for the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and for the respective disease infections caused by these pathogens, among their priorities.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident was not drunk
The official intelligence review in the case of police captain XXII of the district, which caused a fatal accident, is complete.
It may be excluded that the police captain of District XXII, who died on Tuesday and who, in the meantime, retired from his office, was under the influence of alcohol or magic substances, would inform the speaker of Attila Morvai's High State Representative on Friday after the final findings of this case were finalized.
The investigation confirmed the outcome of the original investigation, which has already been found to be that the former police captain did not get any alcohol before he sat on the wheel.
The former director of the 21st District Police Directorate hit Lajose Kossuth on Tuesday in the 21st District with his own personal car, turning the 15-year-old man in front of him when he crossed the vehicle outside the designated crossing.
(The last known fact that the walker walked outside the zebra, otherwise, according to road traffic rules, is not an ominous circumstance, the driving car must also be given priority.)
After transport to the hospital, the walker died.
As a result of these events, the District Police Director withdrew and requested a transfer to the service, according to the police report, because he was so upset.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest State Investigation Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had been working with the state investigators from the beginning.
Other EUR 400 million in infrastructure
The agreement on three credit frameworks of a total value of EUR 400 million in support of education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy were signed by the Minister of Finance János Veres and Marta Gajeck, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) on Friday.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved the Hungarian financial financing of transport and environment projects implemented under the Cohesion Fund, a framework of EUR 300 million, with the parties already concluded a loan agreement of EUR 100 million, which is now in use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
A loan agreement of EUR 150 million is also used to finance school-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary for these purposes, with the extension of the loan agreement to the remaining EUR 150 million.
In the area of innovation, the parties signed a 50m-euro contract, which will use the budget primarily for the Debrecen University research-development project.
The conversation was also about the 4th route.
The parties agreed that after Hungary negotiates with the EU details of the funding of the meter, it will return to whether and how the original contract should be amended.
According to Jánose Verese, this can occur in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed EUR 8.4 billion for a total of 113 projects.
The amount of loans provided by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without a commitment commission is linked to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is the real paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - the attention of the whole of Europe is turning to the earlier slightly forgotten Balkan country.
What, where and who is buying the cheapest, yet fast with the distorting EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max division.
Bulgaria's most sought-after eastern European real estate purchase goal is undoubtedly now with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the seashore.
From the mountains are the most in the course of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoša, then on the seashore Albena, Gold Sands, Sun Coast, the ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for properties around Kavarna and Balčika.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, the interest of investors and the central part of the country - for example, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will be aroused sooner or later - and still more interested people will buy in the vicinity of the exhibition of the cheap city of Russia.
The main city of Sofia is also a promise of pleasant opportunities, business and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best way to turn into one of the most attractive golf areas in Europe, and it will be next to the summer and winter season sought for the road destination even in the next two years.
Predictive investors are already buying in large, for example in the area of Banska.
According to analysts, the buyers of properties in Bulgaria are trying to change their life and lifestyle at the same time.
Most customers come from England, but customers from France, Belgium, Spain and Romania are also more frequent.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors here, at the Black Sea and in the ski resorts, there are traditionally many Russian customers.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three groups, says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The sinking people buy either renovated properties worth 50-100 thousand euros, or broken old houses for 5-15 thousand euros, which then renew.
They require good access and communication opportunities, which are important to them in the proximity of the big city, trades and justice of the local doctor.
The second category is the buyers of chat (Bulgaria was ranked among the first 10 German recreational goals in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who purchase in hopes of a rise in value in the medium or long-term horizon.
Property maintenance in the main city is uninterrupted, as demand is more and more strong.
In Bulgaria, however, the lowest prices of reality in the European Union have grown by 21 per cent per year over the last five years.
The increase in real estate prices is significantly higher than the increase in wages.
Fodor and six percent Hungarian
According to the Minister for the Environment and Water Management of Gábor Fodor, the meeting of experts will be completed on Tuesday and the international climate conference will continue with the ministerial talks after the mid-term start of 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are talking about the Bali Road Map, which addresses the efforts following the reduction of emissions by the Kyoto Protocol in force by 2012.
They are currently being debated by storms between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also announced that they do not intend to deal with exact numbers now, although they agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 per cent by 2020 in view of the 1990 situation.
The next major issue of the conference is whether the developed countries will join in addition to the reduction of emissions to provide both material and technological assistance to countries that are referred to it.
The agreement was also made on grants for developing countries.
The grant fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be run by the 16-member management board, probably within the framework of the World Environment Programme (GEF) at the UN - we can read in the magazine Piac es Profit.
6 per cent of Hungary
The Minister for Environment and Water Affairs Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to play a leading role in efforts to protect the global climate and to assist in the establishment of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 against 1990 levels, irrespective of the success of the adoption of the "agreements after 2012", and is willing to commit to up to 30 per cent reduction in the event that other mature countries in the world will also be willing to accept responsibility and commitments corresponding to their potential.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had reached the target of a 5.2 per cent reduction, and that the EU 15 Member States had then committed 8 per cent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent against the years 1985-87, which our government will fulfil. - The press report of the Ministry of the Environment recalls.
The Bali is a lot, because within two years it is necessary to adopt an international agreement on long-term climate change policy, otherwise its entry into force with certainty would have moved into effect until 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately reinvigorate the new emission reduction system, whose need in its latest report also indicated the need for the UN international scientific assembly dealing with climate change - IPCC, which is the Nobel Peace Prize holder.
This would result in a delay in emission reductions and an inevitable increase in average temperature on Earth of more than 2 degrees Celsius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
British Army implements a set on YouTube
British military units publish on the server to share video recordings from events in Iraq and Afghanistan, which they promote themselves.
First of all, the British Air Force (RAF) favorite YouTube: special units operating in Afghanistan have been recording video from actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC announced.
Recordings, equipped with a miniature camera attached to the trailer, are controlled by the Air Force Commanding Operation in the Kandahara area and then sent to London, where they are transferred to the internet.
Political message is inevitable
By means of the Internet, 139 recordings of British Air Force soldiers have already been made, and more than 75 thousand people have been seen on their "channel".
The British Defence Ministry registered in spring 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and publishes recordings of events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and international peace units in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Establishment in Afghanistan
Air forces have published videos according to their original purpose for the recruitment and according to the Ministry of Defence, they are also good for public awareness of the real purpose of the army's presence abroad.
"The propaganda published in this form against traditional television broadcasts is almost nothing," the BBC expert told Gordon Mackenzie about the defence, "but a certain political message is also required, because the special form confirms the legitimacy of the military actions that the government has decided to do."
The Americans made the game.
The army is concerned that in addition to carefully adjusted, censored recordings on the server, amateur videos, including the death of soldiers: in a few covert, "official" promotional films, the officials at the top talk about losses, however, do not expect a bloody image of the battle.
There have been many videos on the Internet from the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, which occurred during a sharp siege, yet the British army has come upon them so far.
Americans perform a set a little differently - using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which a player can get through more faithful simulations directly into the skin of soldiers.
There will be Christmas in the ministries with a tombol and Pagans
The Ministry of Labour Monika Lamperth is apparently not sentimental: instead of a holiday party, he arranges for his employees a final working meeting, to which the Pagans and Coffee will be dismissed with 2007.
In some ministries there will be a celebration with live music, elsewhere it will give officials the Christmas atmosphere with a tombol and spice.
Dinner, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and Swedish table - so enjoys powerful.
State authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
The most expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Defence this year, however, does not expect its employees.
On Christmas orphans will receive gifts from children of fallen soldiers, at Mission holidays host family members of soldiers currently serving on foreign missions, but also arrange a reception for journalists.
The resort is dedicated to the atmosphere at the end of the year 25 million.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will be dismissed by the other resorts.
The GKM dinner is held in the center of Jöv′′ Haza, with a total of 4,320,000 forints and of the six hundred ministerial staff, approximately three hundred and fifty guests are expected.
The resort will hold Christmas traditions to its celebration, but it will also come to various performances and will also drop the tombol.
The NFÜ Christmas consisted of 4,700,000 forints and held in the State Judicial Council (OIT) on Wednesday - concerts and dinners on the program.
The rental of the hall was made up of a million forints, the remainder was founded on more than four hundred invited.
It seems that one of the NFÜ departments is invited to another Christmas celebration: this is the organisation of a tendering company, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from EU money.
To that end, they rented a theater in Vígsínhaz.
The MAG did not confirm this information, as we failed to reach the person concerned.
Clothing is not necessary
The OIT building was not only hosted by the NFÜ, but also by the Ministry of Justice and Security, which held the 7th of December the St. Lucie dance.
However, OIT did not want money from him for the use of his halls.
Five hundred people attended the dance.
The dinner started by the minister of health, after dinner it was possible to dance for the escort of live music.
According to the answer to the portal [origo] question, there were no obligatory evening clothes or clothing at all.
The Puritan party will host health, work and local self-government resorts.
The Ministry of Health organizes a programme and celebration for employees for 400,000 forints in their own building.
The Ministry of Labour Monika Lamperth's collaborators are not even officially calling for a holiday party, but at the final working meeting.
There are hundreds of 80 guests who, according to the press department, only get coffee and pags, so the party will only have 350,000 forints.
The Minister for Local Self-Government Gordon Bajnai will simply join the Ministry of Local Self-Government and Regional Development with his employees.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) arranges a Christmas season, which includes 436 employees, in its own large hall.
The Christmas party is dedicated to 2,500 forints per guest - the total amount includes the reception with Swedish tables and snacks.
Since being Minister János Veres, PM employees have been celebrating Christmas in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be missing, officiality will enhance not only the ministerial speech, but also the afternoon of the ceremony.
The farm resort organizes the 20th of January New Year's reception, the Minister's Christmas is not known.
The reception will take place in the town gardens of Vajdahunyadvár and, according to the Ministry's statement, 1,000 forts per person are for hundreds of guests.
According to the press department, it will be a very simple reception to invite only relevant foreign diplomats to accreditation in Hungary.
These annual receptions begin with a brief visit by the Minister of Health.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not organize Christmas parties at all, has communicated to the [orig] relevant press department.
The price of the holiday festival of the environmental resort in the press department was not able to communicate.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to a party at the Museum of Art.
It's spreading to the big station.
The Association of Trade Unions of the League, and the General Association of Labour Councils (MOSZ), respectively, will establish its task force on Friday to coordinate Mondayly unlimited positions.
On Saturday, a protest public meeting will be held, on Monday - on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - will be stopped.
Action certainly causes a serious disruption of transport, as rail transport is almost completely stopped and employees of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also be incarcerated within 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League will meet together with the State Association of Labour Councils with details jointly organised Monday's events.
The LIGA-MOSZ Joint Committee will also be set up, which will coordinate Monday's actions.
On Saturday there is a protest public meeting, then Monday the committees joining the station will stop working for an indefinite period, unless a deal is reached with the government.
This means that the deadline was not set for the closure of the status which began on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament does not finally adopt the Health Insurance Act, the committees will immediately withdraw the call.
However, if the legislation is repealed, the Committee of Common Positions shall meet and decide on another procedure.
It is also possible, according to the Monday session of Parliament, that the health insurance law will be voted until late evenings, if necessary at night.
As a result of the start-up on Monday, it is possible to calculate with serious disruptions of transport: work on the railway will be stopped for an indefinite period, a part of the Budapest collective transport and more than half of Volán can be stopped in the morning.
At the same time, there are many places in the country also to close half of the road.
A number of committees and civil organisations, whose list is kept up to date on the sides of the League, have joined the event.
Some organizations have announced the status for a period of uncertainty, others have announced a temporary suspension of work.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railway (MÁV) and the Independent Association of Railway Workers (VDSZZZ) were unable to agree on sufficient services, while at the beginning of the holiday holidays they travel by rail as many people as possible.
According to today's announcements, from the beginning of the operation up to 13 hours at BKV, from 7 to 9 a.m. to Budapest Airport, the Committee's Association of Workers in the Energy Industry of the LIGA has called for the Committee's Association of Pedigree and the Democratic Committee's Association of Pedigree.
The Hungarian Doctors' Association will be held all over the country, the Democratic Committee of Workers' Association in Health and Social Affairs (EDDSZ), which is part of the Cooperation Forum of Trade Unions (SZEF), will hold a two-hour surveillance station.
The most important of the four requirements formulated by the League is that the government withdraw the proposal for a health insurance reform and submit a new concept to the public discussion.
The second requirement is that the new method of calculating the income is gradually introduced from next year.
Third, to ensure the possibility of inclusion in the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Association of Railway Employees (VDSZZZ), which belongs to the League Association, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economics and Transport concerning railway lines, and expects another offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increased the country's risk
The Hungarian Guard's activity, based on the support of the movement of Jobbik Magyarorszägért in August of this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital Institute, has immediately increased in several aspects of Hungary's political risk and the whole area.
The "risk warning" developed by the company states: in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, it is the greatest political risk that "by focusing on the already existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and the non-Roma population of Hungary, it may already come to violent ethnic shocks in a short time".
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is probably aimed at triggering such an action - the research institute is delivering.
As it is written, all of this can be explained by one of the biggest shortcomings of Hungarian political representatives: "the public debate on the Roma issue has left representatives of public life to representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could build a political strategy on the Roma-Madrean dispute."
This problem deepens, makes normal dialogue impossible, reinforces extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - a judicial institution.
In addition, the Hungarian Guard's activities, according to the Research Institute, are influenced by the high attention of domestic and foreign media "to a significant extent by the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to the belief in the country's stability and its democratic prosperity".
The Institute recalls: part of the reorganisation of Hungarian radical and ultra-regulatory groups, which has been gaining ever greater publicity and coverage since autumn 2006, is that since 2007, a number of organisations have been created in Hungary, which themselves are known as the "national militias".
"The common feature of these groupings is that they themselves define themselves as a civil society, while they openly declare - and armed - the readiness of their members to carry out defence tasks (in the case of life disasters, attacks by the authorities, violations of order), in addition to pointing out the inability of the police, the army, or the state," he adds.
It further notes that all of this is being done in a way that seeks to pack up the most diverse political efforts made to resist civil society and parties.
The emphasis on civilisation and the form of society in the event of these meetings is therefore not only to avoid legal delays in judicial registration, but also to be a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the Hungarian Guard’s activity is also an increase in risk from the point of view of neighboring relations.
"In recent months they have pointed to the Hungarian Guard in a number of neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, ultranationalist political representatives of some neighbouring countries want to apologise to the Hungarian Guard for their own anti-Making policy.
All of this can have an impact on the political stability of the area," he adds.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not a single phenomenon, so political risk for the region as a whole has increased.
According to the Hungarian Guard, the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, for example, are similar to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation announced in August 2007 the ultra-regulatory Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the Bulgarian Guard, there are mass Roman disturbances that exploded in one of the Sofia districts (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used it to establish a guard with the aim of the organization being "national homeguard".
In the past 17 years, according to it, there has been a "cican terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and weak, the Institute of Political Capital recalls.
It adds that the initiative sparked a heated debate by the Bulgarian public.
As it continues, the increase in the risk of ethnic violence signals the announcement of some Bulgarian Roma organisations that they create their own fence on the mark of resistance.
Since the current activities of the Hungarian Guard show similarities with the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that even the Hungarian Roma react to the threat of a similar way, by establishing their own defence, we can read in the warning of the risk created by the Political Capital Institute.
Attila Juhász, research director of the Political Capital Institute, asked the press office: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, risk analysis is issued every year and if it finds something that might have an impact on the change in risk, it informs the public opinion, such as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Celebrations aren't free everywhere.
In Hungary, the days of the holidays are precisely defined by the law, and it has already become a general practice to move around the holidays, which awaits us several times in the coming year.
In the European Union and in America, celebrations are not united.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and state holidays and working days.
Workdays of peace usually weigh on church holidays or on significant historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is work free - for the New Year in order for people to rest after Silvestro.
During the year, we have a total of eleven free celebrations.
On March 15, 1848 and October 23, a memorial day of the 1956 revolution was celebrated.
On 20 August, we celebrate the founding of the state, May 1st, November 1st and November 2nd, we remember the dead relatives and friends.
In addition, we have the two-day celebrations of Easter, Summer and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays are rarely the same as the weekend, the practice of moving a working day in cases where we would work only one day before or after the holiday.
The price for the weekend is, of course, that we are staying at the workplace and at school last Saturday.
The day that the celebration immediately precedes or follows it, we have worked out, for many years, that the Minister of Labour has been adjusting in his special statement.
The law applies equally to all employees and their employees, to public employees and to persons in public service.
It does not, however, concern companies and institutions which are in operation without interruption or in view of their determinations, even on working days.
This year, only around the end of the holidays will change the working order: from December 24, life in the country will be almost stopped, because according to modern experience, most people between Christmas and Silvester are "working" before or using a saved holiday.
In the next year, several of our holidays fall in the middle of the week, respectively at the end of the week, so the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
First, the calendar will be changed around the holiday so that the workers can stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day so that it can be on Friday, May 2.
The next move relates to the festival on October 23rd: Saturday, October 18th will work instead of Friday 24.
At the end of the year, however, it will be able to take place completely in the symbol of the holidays, since from December 24th they will have almost nowhere to spend their holidays, even though Silvester is on Wednesday.
Six scary little things you can piss off your colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send out, voice messages that we never get, innocent lies that we don't even notice: they're all "screaming" every day at the workplace.
The question is whether you will get used to these minor inconveniences, or you will put on gloves and unclear situations that others may be angry with, you will deliberately avoid.
Types.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that they were looking for you from the marketing department," your colleague will tell you.
That's why you've lost your mind?
In the best case, he's sorry and he's trying to fix it, maybe he's calling the marketing department and saying he forgot to send the message (this is a less common solution).
The most common thing is solved once apologise.
Before it comes to embarrassing apology, it is good to think about what you can do to prepare your colleagues for unpleasant moments, and consciously try to avoid it.
Do you borrow something that's not yours?
It's nothing more unpleasant than to lean on some letter, office needs or your phone, and they're not there.
Remember you put yourself on the sink table yesterday, but it's gone in the morning?
Or have you discovered your pens on one of your colleagues' tables that you thought were lost?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without your permission, or they'll be angry at you for taking care of them.
Do not take cover or glue paper from your office because it may be unpleasant when you get in early, and you will need it immediately.
The fights about the private life of colleagues?
There's no good way to stop the spread of the cages.
Who, who, what was he doing with?
Where and why?
Don't know everyone's stories about the private life of colleagues!
If any of them share their innermost secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Lock in what you've heard, and in his absence, don't try it with your colleagues, even when others know about it.
No reason to report your absence?
If you call the office and with a call for strong headaches you report your absence, because it's not good for you, or you say that you'd rather rest today, you think that your work, the urgent tasks and the work they have a term will have to do for you someone else.
Take care of your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you will not go to work, or that something may happen that you will have to stay home, tell them that your colleagues and leaders will not be confronted with your absence until the next day.
Consumption, Hiking, Telephoneing
Did you get so tired of work that you're being pushed out of the pit by your colleagues?
Were you reluctant to witness a telephone conversation that would be better not to hear at all?
Do not interrupt your employees by using, singing, loud calls (over their heads), or assging, steady swearing, loud dissatisfaction.
All of this can be disruptive even when they're just not prevented from doing some project (writing, planning, organization).
You're accusing me of second-guessing?
If there is something on time or you have forgotten to send important letter or message, do not blame for your other forgetfulness!
Don't call for any chaos in the office and sound colleagues!
Admit it if you're wrong and someone's paid for it and fix the damage!
Ask yourself how you can put things right, fix the trouble!
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Warms and slippers: comfortable clothes at home, though not suitable for the office!
Don't wear your clothes for free time, even if it allows your profession!
Don't be rude, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in ordinary clothes - and if your profession requires it, it's nice and elegant!
When Someone Wants to Cope, He Stops Being Interesting
Getting in the usual wound wound.
The radio will respond to special melodies: the sound of noise, to which electronic effects are connected.
I'm adding a voice.
Music changes pace and the previous tone is added bass, then the women’s congregation joins as a true curse.
At station mr2 is a composition of the group Zagar called Wings of Love.
Our home music life has not been a source of quality electronics for us for a long time.
Suddenly, though, the tape looks quite different because you're just listening to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboie, a few new and interesting productions from the home digital underground, the overall picture slowly changes, and although it is again in the style of garage rock with its roasting into the guitar, and the home electropop proves that it is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Péticostel, and he also played in Yonderbo's band, when it finally ended - perhaps because two idiots didn't take to one card - he left his own way.
With his project (Zagar) and music, which connects elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to search until he was invited to compose film tracks (e.g.
film Ference Töreka "Szezon").
His formations, at the beginnings of smaller clubs, were known to the wider audience after the magazine wan2 organized their first album from 2002 among the 50 most important home boards and announced Zagar in Yonderboie as the only domestic actors for development that could also be sold in the West.
Zagar and his band are undoubtedly "in the course", although of course no one asked if they were satisfied with this sticker.
The chapel reacted as it did: it made a new, better album.
The currently released album called Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new paths, although the name itself is trying to create a bond with the initial flights in Pétikosteli.
This is a single verse from the composition of the darkest old chapel Balázse Zságera.
A link to essential, flying would be in place, but beside the essential breath of this music now appeared - in accordance with the spirit, trend of time - louder guitar, influence of rock and roll.
In these songs the singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, presented himself to the premiere of the board in the Millenáris park.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the station mr2 Pet′′fi, which played from the last time in the morning to the evening popular music, we started to develop the numerous melodies of Wings of Love compositions, fed with six home singers ("underground Divas").
So everything's all right (?).
The portal Hvg.hu told Balázse Zságer.
hvg.hu: In relation to this new hit, the question is offered, how much remains what you are playing, district music?
Balázs Zságer: Definition of border music doesn't mean much to me.
I think there are two different bands of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, nothing to say, and that's just how it can occur only for sale, which makes it commercial.
However, a good pop composition can come from an honest internal need.
This spirit also acts as accepted, regardless of language and state boundaries.
Hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience towards your music?
B. Zs.: In a foreign country, especially from us to the west, light music has a larger tradition.
There are not only teenagers and people in 20s, but also older ones.
Much more is being followed by changes in light music that are going on around them, because they also consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Do you care who, where, and how much your music listens to?
B. Zs.: Of course, it's a good feeling that our concerts go on as many people as possible.
But we never made music for the market.
We don't have music for a purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the public can be played at concerts where mutual influence is already in place, but it is hidden only in the inevitable changes at the moment.
Even so, I've noticed that when a person wants to make the audience feel good, he's been going to be interesting ever since.
Hvg.hu: How much are you going to follow Yonderboie's example?
He works alone, and he's built his career more west than us.
B. Zs.: We actually don't go his way, regardless of how our music sometimes tries to explain.
We are more team players who rely on the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At first, of course, it did not prevent our work from being compared to the Yonderboy compositions, but several of us separated from his band and gave up the other way.
Hvg.hu: The Wings of Love composition was first obtained in the heat station mr2 Pet′′fi.
Many heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this composition.
Have you, of course, opened up the most popular style in the world with wider layers?
B.Zs.: We shouldn't have planned to write a hit that we would sell the board to.
There's more to that song.
We thought of it as the finals of the album, which we tried to release from the previous sound organ and more complex themes.
Hvg.hu: How did you choose those six singers?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel congregation.
Then came the idea of putting together this soloist group of home music scenes with a good voice.
So this six - year - old congregation - that is, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enik年 Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - was put together, which we then converted to the Underground Divas.
Hvg.hu: That's exactly what you meant by the song, or did girls make up something about it?
B.Zs.: For a long time in the instrumental version, when the material was on the board, we thought that there would be something else needed for this composition.
After the accords, he tried to add a song to it.
I sang a song to him that night, which the girls later learned.
The whole thing came out almost suddenly and terribly spontaneously.
I remember how it came back to life, but of course, it needed the Divy.
With my voice, it wouldn't work like that.
Hvg.hu: As on the desktop, the concert seemed to be girls in the background.
They don't have solos (except Judy Jay), they don't have their own roles, they sing all together and they're not louder than music, so music just doesn't support their songs.
They also stood in the back of the sights.
Is that intentional?
B.Zs.: The fact that they stood in the back was only because of technical problems.
The fact that we didn't want to split the solo role is the opposite of intentional.
And that composition is that we forget a little bit about our ego, who is, where it belongs, and let us just let those wings raise their wings of love.
I wanted this euphoric state, which we felt when the song was born, to feel the others.
Hvg.hu: What was the most work with?
B.Zs.: During the composition of music, not with one, the harder pieces occurred more during mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play on the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time he didn't want to work the groove, then everything pretty slowly found his place as in some puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which composition from the new board is your favorite?
B.Zs.: This is still changing by concerting and I've already released the board.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth a Never The Same.
The treacherous broker risked billions of minorities
That's a fake fraud.
This is the description of his well-known employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French bank giant Société Genérale, owner of the foreign commercial bank.
She came for him with five billion euros.
But it seems to me that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to get along with his colleagues and certainly couldn't.
Unlike all large banking houses, he's been able to solve the mortgage crisis on the American market at once.
"It's spiritually weaker," sounded out of the mouth of his superiors who sent the police to him.
As is true of Kerviel's statement by the French media, for example, Le Monde's journal, was the person who had a profit of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year's trades.
Crisis Not Just in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in a statement.
In summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros in the US crisis.
That's what the opportunity has felt since the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to appear that so-called sub-prime mortgages provided to low-copy clients or those who had problems with payment in the past would have problems.
This crisis had no effect on the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and put it right.
At the end of the year, his profit fell to 1.6 billion euros.
"Since I made the first half billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits, adding that he certainly didn't leave anything for himself.
In the entire investigation, he admits that he faked the records so that they wouldn't come to him.
He even managed to cheat his boss, even though he was beginning to be interested in his business with the Eurex stock exchange.
The risk was gain
He was afraid he'd come after him?
Not anymore.
"I thought the simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he take so much risk?
He had to work on his position gradually.
He joined the General Society in 2000 just after he graduated from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later, he was an assistant broker and in 2005 he became a single broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
He knew he'd never make as much as the others.
"I already knew in my first interview in 2005 that they were paying for me.
For my education and also for professional and personal development," Kerviel described to investigators.
But soon after the show, the first great success came.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won, in the bombings on London, half a billion euros.
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you earn, we'll leave you.
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses knew all about it, or they knew it.
"As long as I made money, my eyes were closed."
But then the morning came at the beginning of this year.
In one day, he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in the middle of January, he wanted to cool it down.
When he came to work Monday, he didn't work at the bank anymore.
And the bank reported a few days later that he had a five billion euros.
And how did they get to him?
He became a suspect for his vacation.
"I've only picked four days for last year.
A broker who doesn't have a vacation is a broker who doesn't want someone to look into his records," Kerviel closed.
Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech government ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can receive EUR 14 billion (approximately SEK 365 billion) in the coming years.
It is about half of the total amount that can be obtained by the Czech Republic from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns will come from seven operational programmes in the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns from the Business and Innovation programme.
The biggest money, up to 150 billion, will be heading for transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the funds available to the Czech Republic.
This money will increase the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will be managed by 90.8 billion crowns next year.
The Business and Innovation programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to obtain funds for innovation.
Companies should receive funding for the implementation of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the implementation of more efficient organisational methods.
In today's waste of money from EU funds, the Czech Republic has been among the least successful in the newly adopted countries.
Twenty-year sentence for President Nikaragui confirmed the court
The Court of Appeal in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday a 20-year sentence for the former president of Arnold Alemán, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for a financial fraud of $100 million (a total of 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived in a domestic prison on his glove near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
If the head of this Central American State from 1997 to 2002 returns back to the network, it is not clear according to the AP agency at this time.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérezvo will now be responsible for the prison authorities, whether they let Germany serve his punishment at home or he's travelling to prison.
Four years ago, the Court proved to Germany that it regularly transferred government money to an account of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the account actually belonged to his relatives and closest associates.
Some of these money then ended up in the fund that Germany founded on financing its election campaign in 2001.
So we've got a budget approved.
That's right.
The state budget was adopted.
What makes this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget prepared by this government and adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
This year, he was still supported by the ČSSD because he was prepared by the Minister of Sobotka and the ČSSD could not afford to accept it.
Unlike the throttle debate before the vote on mistrust, the government is not doing anything dramatic this time.
This traditional, although most influential, filmmaker passed the law in peace.
It's a certain paradox.
Each government starts and ends with each chapter and budget item, whether or not someone likes it.
The budget is a major part of the policy, but it is hidden from the powerful opposition of the government.
This is more grateful to the media and is why it pays much more attention to it.
Politics is much more interesting for the public than hard numbers.
The state budgets in the last socially democratic governments have suffered from three unrests, which for 2008 are unable to resolve at once:
The first is a high share of the law of compulsory, so-called mandate expenditure, which is not only income, but also social doses, which were approved by the silent "coalice" ČSSD and KSCHM last year.
The second is a lack of economic activity as a result of the insomnia of the first.
The third limit is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of the budgets of cities and municipalities.
However, the greatest risk is not a government budget deficit.
This one's public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is a budget deficit for cities and municipalities.
Many seniors, in addition to money from taxes, fees and loans from the bank, receive other sources of investment, often issue debt-free bonds with which they have disproportionately owed their consultants.
In the past years, they have been able to pay these debts for the mass sales of energy shares and other distribution networks received from the state from privatisation.
They don't have this source anymore.
If we stick only to official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy has been going on for several years, just like the rest of the world, a growing phase, which is constantly choking the ČSSD.
It was a unique opportunity for her governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, however, the state still owed more.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have hosted much more reasonable than our republic.
It's a huge shame, especially to the previous governments.
We are among the countries that are at least at global risk of poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programs that have, unfortunately, been completely absorbed in huge dimensions in recent years.
Although some of the foolish populist expenditures approved this year before the elections have been abolished, so that in the near future it will not be possible to move the limit of retirement and pension reform, then it will actually end any policy in this country and let anyone rule it simply.
It is said, with little emphasis, that government policies will become officials, mechanically disbursing most of the money spent on income and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only stop the publication of normal expenditure by mandates.
The planned deficit of 70 billion per year for 2008 would be totally unnecessary if the previous governments did not manage over the past ten years as much as they could.
If we do not really want it to happen that government policies will only become officials, then we must be patient and encourage this poorly strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend as much as it can on taxes and fees as it can, to prepare for further reform laws.
Only those will allow for the gradual achievement of the balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the Central Bank of Britain, Switzerland and Canada decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
In the monetary market, this will bring more than a hundred billion dollars through auctions.
In these auction banks, they prefer interest rates that are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will send $40 billion to auction, and the next $40 billion will then be available to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of the eleven September, the central banks of each country agreed on a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step is to solve the biggest economic difficulties, which is the growing lack of free capital that banks could borrow," he wrote in his report to the customers of Bernard Baumohl of Economic Outlook Group.
"The coordinated actions of central banks have reduced the likelihood of recession in the United States from 65 per cent to fifty per cent," Baumohl added in his report.
The banks have already made $60 billion for unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of losses.
"Central banks must be really afraid of what else can follow when they decide on this process," said ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
The central banks are concerned that if banks have difficult access to loans themselves, they will prefer to lend to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy to recession with possible impacts on the economic growth of the world.
The central banks thus decided that the so-called LIBOR rate could not be reduced, the London interbank rate used to borrow money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still worried about borrowing money, and even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and Britain decreased several times during the fall of their interest rate.
"It will have the same effect as another decrease in interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not think that the central bank's move will contribute to the blessing of the crisis, because it does not solve the basic problem, which is the fall of the property market in the United States.
Klaus: Ecological debates are incredible
Global climate change is most likely to harm developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again spoke on the issue of global warming.
The criticism has now taken place at the UN's final international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not a green planet, he stated that ecological debates are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference, which creates a strange mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that binds it and the reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it is only a firearm of words that is a substitute for solving the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President, in presenting his book, stressed that its theme is very important to him, and that is why he is so committed to it.
He also expressed satisfaction at the fact that the book also appeared in the German translation, because, as he said, "I often meet only with the caricatures of my opinions."
Now, then, the interested ones can read his unimaginable position.
Klaus pointed out that he is not a climatologist, but, in his opinion, he has sufficient assumptions to write such a book.
He is an academic who is able to monitor and assess the trade union, has experience in statistics and is also a national economy.
In the main conclusions of the book, he noted that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are therefore normal, that there is no proper opinion of all scientists on the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and therefore do not pose a threat and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptable.
Moreover, as a person with experience with totality, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproved opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their use".
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at Hayek Institute.
The driver couldn't exchange 600 thousand people.
Six hundred thousand drivers have passed the deadline and have not been able to exchange an old driving licence whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day on which people can ask for an exchange to be made by the authorities until the end of the year.
The Ministry is afraid, however, that after New Year's time they would be released on the road of a static driver without a valid authorization.
According to the authorities, the certificate was not exchanged mainly by those who did not want to drive anymore.
While the municipality is reporting a sharp decline in the interest of the exchange of drivers, the authorities in the metropolitan area have been affected by requests and the interest in the exchange of the ticket increased this week.
The magistrate delivers around 2,000 customers a day.
There's about half an hour waiting on the front.
In Prague, the driver's license hasn't changed about 140,000 drivers yet.
The presentation of the new ticket takes twenty days.
However, it is possible to request a publication within a shorter period of five days.
In such a case, the driver will pay five hundred crowns.
Motorists who do not reach the end of the year and drive on the road without a valid driver will be threatened from the ice.
The offender will pay up to two thousand crowns.
But a police officer can deal with a crime by agreeing.
In the case of administrative infringement, the fine shall be paid to 2500 crowns.
According to the previous information, he could have been punished by the council and by a man who would not go anywhere.
He could have paid 30,000 crowns at the time.
The Ministry has previously called on the authorities to be mild and to impose the maximum fine of a thousand koruna.
According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport, Karl Hanzelka, but tens of thousands of punishments are no threat to anyone.
The driver's license is based on the evidence that people can decide whether or not they want it.
It's not a civil record that everyone has to have in place.
People who don't want to drive should give up a driver's license.
It shall be sufficient to receive or send a recommendation by mail to the competent public authority.
At the end of the year, the licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be paid.
But motorists need to exchange their other types of driving licenses gradually.
People with evidence from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
The validity of the certificates issued between 2001 and 2004 shall expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, about 2.6 million other documents are coming.
The court reduced the punishments for detectives in charge of Berdijk.
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Konňarík, who are accused of having a criminal relationship with David Berdy's gang, will go to prison for thirteen and ten years.
With the final validity of the decision, the Supreme Court of Prague decided to reduce the fines so that they would be fined once a year and two years a year.
Originally he threatened the detectives of the Prague Committee for Combating Organized Crime 14 and 12 years.
It is no longer possible to appeal to the Supreme Court against the present decision.
Berdich is also accused in this case, but he is only waiting for the first instance verdict.
In other cases, however, he has already been punished in a total of more than 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the Supreme Court acknowledged in particular the participation of 19 people who were guilty of robbery, and today the Supreme Court has decided to appeal 16 of them.
Most of the defendants' complaints from the start of the investigation refused to accept the case under construction.
According to the Central Senate, police officers, inter alia, handed over information from police sources to criminals with Berdich, covered individual robbery and helped gang members to avoid criminal liability.
Gang gave up 30 percent for Opava and Konjárík for it.
The complaint concerns gang criminal activity from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, the robbery, which victims have often suffered serious health damage, but also the abuse of the authority of the public agent and the illegal weapons.
At home visits, the police discovered illegally held guns, steel cores, laser detectors, or self-defense.
Gang was accused of stealing tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to the inadvertent 20 men in this process, the courts have already ruled guilty of other Berdy's robbery and a number of other people.
Other men from around Berdych are still in trial, some of the cases have not yet been heard before the trial.
The main occupation has so far been avoided by Tomáši Póto and Maroši Šulejov, who live in an Irish prison where they are waiting for a final decision on their release for accession to the Czech Republic.
Child replacement account: 12 million
For the replacement of children in the womb, the lawyer of Igor Veleba's damaged families wants 12 million crowns, plus court expenses, after the Trebian hospital.
For every mother by three million, for parents by two million, and for children by one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for every parent.
The legal representative of the hospital Ondræj was therefore not in agreement with Veleby's proposal.
"We reject such a requirement, it is very high," said Got it after today's discussion.
"But in order for us to make an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need a knowledgeable judgement that the counter-party has left to work out.
We'll find out if he's got any value at all.
But we insist that it will be in the statistics for all," Gottl stressed.
According to him, the share should move between 100,000 and 200,000 CZK for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, a family from Jablonov wanted a month in which she did not raise her biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velebov served as the basis for the negotiation of the compensation expert's assessment, which was prepared for him by the Faculty of Hospitals in Prague-Motole.
Children’s parents, according to psychologists and psychiatrists, suffered psychological harm and stress in various degrees and depths.
The stress situation was better endured by men, even when they were confronted with the rumors that the replacement of the newborns was not forbidden.
Women are again worse off with the current experienced trauma and with what is happening right now, Veleb's content has been cut short.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by the nurses at the Tribune Hospital on 9 December.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Čermákov to Pribyslavic and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslav Trojan to Jablonov.
Heitman Vysočina Milos  Šstrčíl delivered each family of 100,000 crowns at the end of October in return for the expenses they incurred by the failure of the Tribune Hospital, which the country is setting up.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are covered by the law for liability for damage.
In the event of a doubt, they must reach the reserve fund, exceptionally they may request the assistance of the founder.
The courts have so far admitted relatively low compensation, the sums have been calculated according to the tables in the order of the statisians, with the exception of millions of crowns.
The Flood came about by the kingdom of Valash
Bolek Polivka has lost the argument about the mark of the Valash Kingdom.
According to the judge of the island court, he used the name of the King of Wales for the first time, but the project built a long-term work of the team around Tomáš Harabiš, who worked with the actor.
The soup didn't take part today.
According to his lawyer, the case probably doesn't end and the client's calling.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are paralysing Bolka Polivky's popularity," said Polivkov's lawyer after the process.
According to him, all of us in the words of the kingdom of Valash are equipped with just actors and comics.
You have the same opinion, Harabish.
"There's almost a decade's work behind us.
Looking for money and thinking of actions," he said.
According to him, there's a lot of money.
"After years they realized that the project was successful and could have something to do with it.
They want to parasiticize on our work," he added.
Liquefied business
According to the court's designation, the king of Wales first used Polivka in his television series.
In 1993 she was crowned by an actor Radoslav Quick-rich.
At that time, however, it did not have to do with the purpose of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came up with the idea of issuing Welsh belts.
Out of the initial recession, trade and the lucrative business activity on which Harabiš was founded was excluded.
In 1997 Polívka agreed with the introduction of his name and signature in the passports and even offered their holders discounts at the visit of his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabiš had only used the bare idea that Polívka had published in his management for his business purpose.
"The popularity of Boleslav's Seeds of the Valash Kingdom project certainly helped," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabish and his team, who devoted themselves intensely to him.
Cooperation today continued until 2000, when Harabiš for Polivka organized official coronation in Vsetina.
Since then, however, there have been disputes between Polivka and Harabiš, which have led to the sitting of "King of Boleslav I. elected for the furt".
The leader's role in the kingdom was then captured by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as the queen's mother.
In 2002, Polivka filed a complaint against Harabiše and his company, which he rejected today.
Clearly, it could lead to Harabiş's coming up against the throne and half of the princess.
A new king should come out of him.
He didn't want to tell the details and the time.
"We don't want to make it.
It should be something like a king's ride to Slovakia.
The king should be elected for a certain time.
Mr. Polivka can also log in quietly," Harabish added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: misleading conclusions
Actually, I've never fanned a lot of Peugeot 206.
His driving characteristics were not much, the quality of handling, handling, and also productions would be marked as intermediate leaks.
But the market is now the successor of Peugeot 207, and the one is much better.
And the van called SW is still a bit further, and I'm not left to think better.
When I tested the classic hatchback of Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, about the space on my head in the back seat.
This is the end of the complaint, because the bodywork of the van means that no two-foot long ones will suffer in this direction.
The World’s Flight
I'm going through the interior very quickly so I don't get too repeated.
This is a complete design, where I have the only leak to the poor middle tunnel.
Here I'd appreciate something more designer invention when the car looks so elegant.
Sittings are comfortable and you're there when we could complain about short sittings or trimmings.
Side management has also improved significantly against model 206.
As far as space is concerned, there's an increase in body size here.
Then, in the van, there's already a lack of space on the head.
Boxes
So the main one on this truck is his trunk.
I have to evaluate it as very well accessible (and also thanks to the opening of the back window) and as properly consistent.
The deaf places are equipped with retaining rubber, which are the ideal compromise.
It doesn't interfere, it can spread, and it will keep even harder objects.
But let's stay together above the volume.
It is based on the tables in the basic arrangement of 428 l, which is rather an average value against competition.
However, not against the Czech most sold vehicle of this class - the damage of Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with a new generation of juveniles, then we'll find that Peugeot is left with a lot of 52 liters.
This value is to be considered as a critical value on a vacation abroad or when loading a cart.
But if I should raise the positive, then I still have to mention a completely straight floor after the construction of the second row or very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a burner with a capacity of 1,6 l with an output of 88 kW.
And to be honest, that's how it's supposed to look like a sixteen-year-old who's running a family hatchback.
She's quiet, she's having a little consumption, and she's mostly pulling.
If I compare it to a period of damage that sometimes acts as if it had a hadr attached to the hatch, I can only be excited about it.
The price will be charged.
The price of the car is not human.
However, we must remember that we were testing properly equipped cars with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the vehicle with the auction 14th floor for 329 900 CZK will still go away.
Our aggregate is 410 900 CZK, which is enough.
The tested premium equipment will then accommodate the equipment for another 80,000 CZK designs.
But we still had the main airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic driver release, electrical back window control...
It's just the car stands all over 531 900 CZK.
It's a lot, but you can count the extra equipment at Fabie and you'll get a lot like that.
So there's nothing left but to decide for the brand.
The integration of Slovenian pupils in British schools is not possible
In British schools, children from Eastern Europe arrive, and local residents are worried about further developments in local schools.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans has so far been an obstacle to a number of obstacles.
The British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and children of the natives are increasing in violence.
The problem of integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools is well illustrated in the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local residents and Slovenian immigrants are beginning to be staged.
The jokes, the jokes, and the fights between the pupils also moved into relationships between parents.
The situation went so far as to keep a Slovenian woman in Chatham holding a ten-year-old trainee with iron fists.
She's guilty of defending herself from being attacked by a boy with racist instructions.
The police had to attack two innocent girls after the attack on the Slovenian immigrant.
The men's girls were supposed to be celebrating racist remarks and throwing stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy jumped out on a bus stop and started swimming on us.
When I told him to let it go, he turned on us with apples and pears, and then discovered his ass," she described another unpleasant incident for The Times mother of Slovenian students.
The complaints are on both sides.
One of the local residents even marked disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe for the fight against survival.
The above mentioned cases suggest that the atmosphere in British schools between local and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
In Britain, there are 70,000 Slovaks who have headed here for work.
The funeral of 30,000 Slovenian students then attends British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it can be fulfilled if you choose the right course.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or sea, calm as a fisherman.
Palms and all inclusive with cupboards offering on the beach pizza, ice cream and side cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you will find it in full and even richer numbers.
Only on one island but you will find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
For the Spaniards, Cuba was the heritage of their America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place human eye ever looked.
Havana became the warehouse and translation site of the treasures that the Spaniards in the Americas spread and moved to Europe.
And then the American era came.
Hotel Nacional grew up at the end of 20 years.
He left it to be built by one of the heads of the American Mafia Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the United States (especially for the ban) was welcomed and supported by drugs, gambling, prostitution in Cuba.
His guests were me.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall houses grew, and after a wide boom, cars that belonged to the cult symbols of the 50th century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a settlement in San Francisco de Paula, a piece from Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Medio, they left their signatures to show business stars and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
On the walls in the Havana Bodeguit, you can leave your autograph as well.
At the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional you will be served with cocktails according to your wishes.
And those 50-year-old cult cars have been driving after Havana so far, because once imported leaves and fiats in that salty and wet air have long since passed away.
Although Havana is, in particular, its oldest part, much broken down, yet nowhere in the area is there as beautiful colonial memories as just there.
Other places also turn into beauty, such as Trinidad.
Since travel brings so much money, its development has green.
In the last 15 years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but in particular in Varadera, on the coast of Holguín and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another librarian, which is unique in the world and is particularly appreciated by the riders.
A third of the scattered plantations were tied to sugarcane by narrow wheels of steam and motor train.
Their car park hasn't been renewed for decades, so there are machines running there, whose layers are still in museums.
Where to go?
Most visitors in Cuba are not mined.
It's about Varadera, or Havana, you don't have to write down too much.
I just hope to remind you that in Hemingway's settlement already mentioned is a museum and who likes this writer should not leave the visit.
The Viňales Valley One of Cuba's most picturesque corners is the Viňales Valley in the west of the island.
It's a plant that grows from a lime floor.
Possible, armed homoles and rocks rise sharply from the bottom of the valley and in their dunes the fertile ground has been swept away, making even the giant ladders covered with dense growth.
The valley is a place where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is growing.
You can meet with its final shape if you visit any of the Taiwanese mills for the production of dolls.
Perhaps someone will be interested in the fact that Major Zeman's Chilean work was involved.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
His fame and wealth brought him trade with slaves and sugar.
Wealth turned into the beauty and exhibition of the small town.
The colonial Spanish architecture, strongly influenced by later French settlers, has almost changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the mountains of Escambray, is so remote that in the 50th century there was no road there that that country would connect to the rest of the country.
She helped him stay away.
Nothing happened there, and that's why nothing happened, everyone was happy to have a roof over his head.
If a person has more time on Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is worth looking at interesting places nearby, such as Playa Ancón Beach, or the Gulf of Sugar.
The evening is then to go to Casa de la Música, who lives after seven and the music in it runs over the morning.
Baracoa
The town in the very east of Cuba is marked by the most beautiful on the island.
The Dozasurist's opinion is already affecting the road itself.
Both the roads leading up there with the Guantanama have to cross high and member mountains and pass through a nature that the human activity has hardly noticed.
The eastern island of Cuba has been registered by UNESCO thanks to its undisclosed nature on the list of world heritage.
They do the best chocolate there, in the church they have the Columbus cross (in fact it was created a hundred years after Columbus sailing) and from the hill where the castle stands and today's Hotel El Castillo is seen several tables mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, doubles, about Mount Sierra Maestra, about the Bay of Pigs and the Island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropican cabaret, about the shrine of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobra, about the shrine, about the African religions that recognize the descendants of some of the slaves, it would be possible to describe many pages.
But, as it's called, it's better to see once.
The allies in Afghanistan are passive, hard-hearted Americans
Few soldiers and lack of necessary equipment are affected by the United States during the mission in Afghanistan.
According to the Minister of Defence Robert Gates, NATO should plan a specific plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not take place as expected by the representatives of the countries with units in the southern part of the country in Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban movement, eight participating States are today discussing further plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States, through Minister of Defence Robert Gates, has called NATO units for more activity this week, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the Afghan government's authority and strengthening development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is important, but military power can be only one part of the solution.
The next is to allow the citizens to start further development of the economy and security themselves," said British Defence Minister Des Browne to the BBC station.
Ninety percent
The activities of the Afghan rebels are reported to be higher than the last five years.
The number of violent acts rose to 27 per cent last year, in the southern Helmand province of 60 per cent.
NATO countries have approximately 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, of which about a quarter in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies reached the same limit in the organisation and equipment units.
In particular, other helicopters, soldiers and experts are required to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about specific goals for the next time and how to achieve them," Gates said.
Similarly, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop spoke today.
"I am not pleased with what we have in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's little," said Reuters De Hoop at the end of the regular talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who Is Passive
In recent months, disputes have also been raised between the participating countries as to whether all the allies are taking the maximum in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticised for its commitment.
"The Germans have relatively numerous representations in Afghanistan.
They are, however, located in areas where the minimum of violence and fighting demands on them are not as high as on us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
This week, the British bullfighting letter Sun marked the German soldiers as Lennox.
"Afghanists are discovered: Germans are playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in material, supplemented by images of German soldiers playing table tennis.
Germany's image of the British unit in the anti-attack in southern Afghanistan has gone to the counter-attack.
State debt will rise to a billion in 2009
In every Czech country, there is a state debt of over 84,000 crowns.
Total debt came to the end of September at 842.7 billion crowns.
The government was planning to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to better development of the state budget.
The State debt of the Czech Republic came to the end of September at 842.7 billion crowns.
In nine months this year, it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
Since June, however, he has reduced by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its state debt data from the beginning of October.
In every Czech country, there's a debt over 84,000 crowns.
Over the last year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"At the same time, it seems that due to the lower deficit for next year, we would be able to overcome the billions of crowns by 2009.
Next year, the debt should move between 900 billion and billion crowns," said Patria Finance David Marek for the iHNed.cz analyst.
Similarly, the analyst Next Finance Vladimir Pikora says: "To exceed one billion we could get in the course of 2009.
When exactly will it depend on the next budget that we do not know yet.
If it turned out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could move to 2010.
But I do not anticipate this change," he said.
Overdue debt
The State debt constitutes the central government's debt and, above all, creates a accumulation of state budget deficits.
State debt is financed by depositary notes, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt has so far risen by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
This year's foreign debt has grown by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
So-called state-owned debt at the end of September reached 803.3 billion crowns and declined by 13.7 billion crowns since June.
The average maturity of government debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased by 13 per cent between the first and the third quarter, which is really much about how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, growth is generated mainly in bonds, with 20% growth.
It is bad that debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows that it will deal with what it will do when the pension reform is here," Pikora commented.
Better Than Waiting
The strategy for financing and managing public debt for 2007 shows that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to better development of the state budget.
The share is mainly a government deficit, which is likely to reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion crowns.
It is also about the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency of 13.3 billion crowns, the ten-billion-dollar reserve for the payment of income, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion crowns and the European Investment Bank's loan of 1.8 billion crowns.
A woman is to be brought to court in the Charter today for giving her name to a ghost bear
The British teacher, convicted in Sudan of violating Islam, was sentenced to a 15-day prison by the Court of Justice on Thursday night and sentenced, as her lawyer stated.
Britka was accused of letting six to seven-year-old pupils give the lye bear's name Mohamed despite the fact that any representation of the prophet to Islam is forbidden.
It was a detailed punishment I was wounded to death.
This British 40-year-old teacher, acting at the University of High School in the Sudan Charter, was arrested at home on Sunday and charged with an attack on Islam and the rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, after several students’ parents complained about the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
Our story begins in fact already in September, when the student in question asks his six to seven-year-old students to choose a name for a class glaucoma bear.
"Out of the children's mouth eight names, including Hasan, Abdullah and Mohamed," says school director Robert Boulos.
After the vote in the class, 20 of the 23 children finally choose the most popular name, Mohamed.
Of course, Mohamed is the name of a Muslim prophet, but above all it is a very expanded Christian name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a bear accompanied by a poem: "My name is Mohamed."
The bear himself had no label with that name, but he had no difficulty showing himself the prophet considered to be a violation of Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew her well and that she would never do anything that might be offensive to any religious faith: "I'm only sorry that she asked the children to vote for some name," he said only about "innocent doubt".
Such an opinion is shared by many teachers who describe it as "very attentive to their students" and add that "never talk about religion in class".
Consider that the second most frequently named Christian name, Mohamed, in Britain, is written in fourteen different ways.
This Christian name often chosen by Muslim families represents a way of worshiping the prophet (often given to the firstborn).
What, though, are the rules regarding the use of this Christian name?
Is it possible, for example, to give them a toy?
Sure, it's a question of interpretation.
In the last round of negotiations this centre in Vienna did not reach agreement on the future status of the province.
At last, it's not working.
The Serbs and Kosovo Albanians completed the sixth round of talks in Austria on Wednesday morning and at the same time, without being able to overcome different views on the future status of this separatist province.
"It is policing that both parties were unable to reach a status agreement," European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the area is "at stake" and appealed to Belgrade and Pristina to ensure that the security of their commitments remained peaceful and were ready for dialogue even after the end of the negotiations.
"We don't expect violence at the nearest time, but we enter a demanding period," he added, "it's obvious that the situation is tense."
The negotiations will end on 10 December.
The Troika negotiators, composed of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last be exported to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90% of Albanian-speaking populations are made up, could be shown in a clearer light by December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexandr Bocan-Charchenko are going to deliver their message to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and at the same time the last round of negotiations since the United Nations, in July this year, entrusted Troika with the new negotiations.
Americans and Europeans are counting on the end of the talks on 10 December.
The Russians who have already blocked the independence of Kosovo in the UN Security Council, on the contrary, insist that the negotiations continue after this very deadline.
"Russia has been and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Bocan-Charchenko said.
Single-day declaration of independence?
After eight years of international governance, the West considers Kosovo's independence under EU supervision as the only solution.
Pristina declares that, in the event that the Security Council does not decide for its benefit, it is prepared to declare independence unilaterally.
Whitehead takes on extended autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached an agreement," said the Kosovo government president Fatmir Sejdiu at the Baden Hotel, where this "opportunity was held on Monday".
Hashim Thaci, former Kosovo Albanians' leader and future prime minister, expressed regret.
He added, however, that the plan of autonomy presented by the Belgrade "was part of the past that led to murders and deportations".
"Dominic effect"
On the contrary, Serbian President Boris Tadic believes that the compromise is still being considered and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of the unilaterally declared independence of the province.
In particular, Belgrade is concerned about the "dominant effect" in the area, which is still unstable as a result of wars for independence in the 1990s.
"But it doesn't mean for Serbia," he said, "that compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions be taken exclusively by the Security Council, in which its Russian associate has the right to veto.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"The only solution from the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
"This conversation lasted two years.
It must end as it began: on the ground of the Security Council."
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "the last word of status will be in Kosovo's parliament" and added that if a unilateral declaration of independence from Albanian-speaking citizens had occurred, it would have been "under agreement" with the West.
Bush in the Israelis and the Palestinians reached an agreement
At the beginning of an international peace conference in Annapolis in Maryland, which was permitted by his charm, US President George Bush announced that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed to a joint declaration.
He clarified that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas agreed on the immediate commencement of the negotiations with the intention of always resolving a 60-year dispute between the two nations.
In the presence of both Bush men, he promised to do everything he could to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must end up with colonial activities, declare Bush and recall the obligations that both sides are facing from the "road map" to the peace that they adopted in 2003.
The Chief of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian self-government led by Abbas have the objective of "closed the peace treaty, which would solve all outstanding issues without exception so far, including central issues".
This declaration includes three questions that are at the core of the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians: the future border of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled during the 1948 conflict from their homes in the territory of the present state of Israel.
Abbas took note of the words of the US President and stressed that the following talks were "total and thorough" and that all aspects of the solution were addressed, by mentioning "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
Then Olmert appeared at the court, which expressed the view that the following negotiations should be "right and continuous" and that it should "be established to be closed during 2008".
Bush set the end of 2008 as a deadline for the realization of his "two-state vision", of the Palestinian and Israeli, which exists next to him.
Saudi Arabia has declared that it has accepted a commitment from Bush in this sense even before it decided to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries that Israel offers peace in exchange for leaving all Arab territories banned for war in 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", judges Prince Saúd in an interview that provided an Arab speech journal protected by Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutors, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such little reports from black chronicle, the official version does not agree with what is being said among people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first findings of the French State Police Inspectorate General (Inspection general de la poise nationale, IGPN), the police car drove on Sunday shortly after 17 hours on Louise-Michel Street in the village of Villiers-le-Bel.
"The vehicle was not in the operation mode, but was on the watch and traveled at speeds 40 to 50 km/h, but there were no side lights on," explains the police source.
The green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, "unregistered, and therefore without permission to drive in public communications" (read below), run by two young people without access, ran "very high speed".
"The motorcycle drove from the left to the police car after it didn't give priority to the message," one police officer explained.
The blood alcohol test performed on the vehicle crew proved negative.
The condition of the car (the damaged front, the broken front glass, the broken brakes) is a witness to the speed of the attack.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (Republique de Pontoise) was very quick to respond to Marie-Thérèse de Givry and yesterday she announced that IGPN was responsible for investigating "the acts of insensitivity killing and the failure to provide assistance to persons in danger", which was also taken over by the departmental department of de la súrété bíblica du Val-d'Oise (Directorate of the National Police Department of Val d'Oise).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation conducted by the IGPN excludes, at this stage, the responsibility of police officers for the accident.
Three witness incidents, which were part of the investigation on Sunday night, confirmed, according to the office, "a version of the police, because the mini-tourist approached them quite quickly to the left."
Any noise, no doubt caused by trimming the ground, yesterday showed that both vehicles remained locked up until the police car was able to speed up.
The vehicles were secured and passed by technical expertise.
There was a drink on both victims' bodies yesterday.
What happened, right after?
Yesterday, in Williers-le-Bel, people were quickly spreading rumors that the police were supposed to leave the scene quickly without giving the first aid to the two young people.
IGPN also had to be careful to exclude "any serious offense" from this point.
"It is a more demanding aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigation and with which it is necessary to be very careful," the police source said.
The daily "Liberation" met with the obvious witness of those moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows then leads directly to where the accident took place.
"We immediately ran down with the nurse who is a nurse in the hospital to try to resurrect them," the witness tells.
I couldn't do anything."
Then he saw the "screaming, totally scared cop.
Two others tried to raise one of the young and the fourth spoke on the phone."
Faced with a rapidly growing tension and certainly present, the situation of young people is hopeless, police officers were driven by colleagues who, in the meantime, arrived at the scene.
According to the witness, the rescue arrived "about 20 minutes after the police leave."
They also carried out a massage of the heart, but in vain.
"Let no one claim that the police authorities have failed to help young people.
The first aid was provided to young people.
The Hasics are here immediately.
Everything was done for their salvation," the prosecutor stressed.
The tension in Pakistan is growing
On Monday, the Pakistani police pressed the first demonstration since the declaration of an exceptional status by General Musaraf, two days earlier.
In Lahor, in the east of the country, about 2000 lawyers demonstrating against measures taken under exceptional conditions were injured by the tears of gas which, according to the witnesses, used the force of order.
The last appointment was answered by a stone, which injured several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been called.
Similar scenarios as in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where policemen attacked and injured lawyers.
Several of them should have been called.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court called after the general stand and announced demonstrations, resulting in the wave of about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
Access streets to the Supreme Court were replaced on Monday morning in order to prevent meetings.
Further demonstrations were to be conducted in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, lawmakers were encouraged by the political strong alliance of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president "received the population to send flowers to judges who stood up against the exceptional state and waste to those who made an oath before the Musharaf".
"Mussaraf's promise doesn't pay."
Pakistan's Supreme Court is the direct target of the extraordinary measure announced on Saturday night.
In the next few days, the legal re-election of President Musharraf in the indirect presidential election that took place on October 6th should be made.
Judge Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry was removed and replaced.
"All that we are witnesses is illegal, illegal and against the Supreme Court's judgments," the official said in The News.
The promise of Parvíze Musharafa that he will surrender to the leadership of the army and become a civilian president "free" after the introduction of an exceptional status, the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azem declared on Monday.
It was expected that military uniforms would be surrendered until 15 November, when his first presidential mandate was completed.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the ice elections could be postponed.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government has also broken down the country's ongoing speculation, according to which the army's deputy chief had to order President Musharraf to be housed in prison.
More than a third of the pregnancy still forms the expected pregnancy
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancy (24 %), as well as poorly planned or developed in an unexpected manner.
More than one pregnancy of three (36%) is still not expected today, a study conducted by the French National Institute d'études demografiques (Ined)- the State Institute of Demographic Studies, forty years after the so-called Neuwirth Act, which in France made anticonception laws.
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancy (24 %), as well as poorly planned or developed in an unexpected manner.
Different methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraceptives or sterilization, still show 5% to 6% of failure rate, estimates Ined.
The prohibition of contraception, however, only allowed for better "fertility control", the constitution argues and notes that the rate of use of hormonal contraception in women between 20 and 44 years of age from 5% in 1970 was 60 % today.
Finally, eight babies from ten today are well planned.
One couple of five has even a month of birth and if possible in the spring, which is considered the most pleasant annual period for the birth of a child.
Surprising correction of the space station
More than seven hours of space work required the astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew members from the International Space Station (ISS) to make a remarkable repair of the fragmented solar panel necessary for further scientific activity of the station.
It was a risky exit to space that collected records of the duration, distance from residential modules, the speed with which it was planned, and the dimensions of the "cultivation", which the astronauts imposed on repair.
Problems arose on Tuesday, while astronauts from the Discovery ship released the Harmony module, a large military service designed to install European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is some kind of docking mill for modules-laborator.
But you need to be able to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move the seventeen-year-old module producing electricity using solar panels that were already on the ISS, so that the whale in its final position.
After she moved it, the crew started disbanding the 70-metre solar panels of the module.
And in that there was one of the panels that split up as a pull-on harmony, as a result of a cable attached, damaged on the surface of a single meter.
Distortion was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts, who were originally to perform a control output on the Discovery ship, and subsequently to go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system had a malfunction, were forced to commit to the damaged panel.
And it was just Scott Parazynski who was chosen to fly to the end of the robotic shoulder of the ship, attached to the shoulder of the station, and carried out the repair.
It's one of the best spacewalkers (space walker) of the US Aviation and Space Agency (NASA).
High, stable, very versatile, has a very elaborate chest and long pajamas.
In his 46 years, this initial call was commissioned by a doctor to "operate" the "damaged" solar panel.
After carefully investigating the damage, he cut off the damaged cable and secured the damaged sites of some kind of "dlahy".
He helped him another spacewalker, who stayed close to the balancing chambers, and also inside, other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, the crew commander.
The instruments which he used, namely the mine hooked with an insulating device to prevent the electroshock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, were invented and "after cutting" produced astronauts on board the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be completely disbanded and then invented his tools and returned to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts used the afternoon rest before today, when seven astronauts were returning to the Discovery ship to return to Earth on Wednesday, as planned.
EADS shares weaken
The EADS shares are likely to lose at the Paris Stock Exchange after this company operating in the aviation and defence industry has announced that it will have to lose 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros to meet the delay of the A400M aircraft.
EADS has lost 4% and is now at the Paris Stock Exchange for €21.96.
The financial group was forced to reassess its expected production results for 2007 as a result of the delay in the slow progress of the A400M engine development, which is the condition of the start-up flight.
The price for the reduction of the delay in the delivery of the military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was calculated "at 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros, of which more than billion for Airbus", the parent company of the European Constructor EADS announced.
For these costs, EADS will be forced to announce a new view of profit before interest and tax deduction (EBIT) on Thursday.
The group also found that a new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
Note that the production results of EADS in 2006 fell by 86 %, in particular due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, i.e. the large airport A380.
The group initially assumed that the first delivery to the A400M airport of the French army would be made in October 2009.
Decision for status quo
Sunday's elections will take place without a hasty expectation: Russians will most of them elect President Putin, United Russia.
Confirming this, after the end of a very little free pre-election campaign, its tendency towards stability, and authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the election to the MP's studio, Russian President Vladimir Putin will inform the voters at public stations of the broadcasted television message, the content of which is kept secret.
It is thus from the position of the leader of the United Russia, the procreative party, which, according to all, celebrates the sober victory.
Yesterday, when he accepted foreign ambassadors, the president did not let anything out of him and satisfied himself with another attack on the West accused of interfering - his favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and wish ourselves the fairest and most transparent elections, elections without the slightest flaw in beauty," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, it's not so far.
They're depriving the campaign of various pressures.
The leader of the communists Gennadij Zjuganov says that "they've never experienced such a dirty election, not even for Jelcina."
After the repression of last weekend's demonstrations, the former world champion in the chess of Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for an illegal demonstration, continues to have a ban on visits, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have remained the mentality of the Soviets."
In the background of the following parliamentary elections of simple expectations, two far more open questions are emerging:
"Who will become Putin's successor in the presidential office?
The Official Journal yesterday published the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; candidates may be represented by the public by 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, is unable to reach a third mandate in line.
However, no follower appears.
- "What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be the prime minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and all-powerful parties of the United Russia, who will elect the government and the president?
Whether this is the case or not, the ruling power will win the whole race in parliamentary elections, as well as in presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have remained the mentality of the Soviets, they do not feel worthy of their fate," according to sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent centre of Levada.
The history of Nikolai Kokossov from the State University in St. Petersburg is all the more distant: a civil society, in this country baptized five centuries after Europe, was delayed; it was the famous common spirit behind the creation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin linked to a patriotic model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population rather than that this new patriotism did not go through terror, but some economic prosperity," Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation is said to be.
The Russians today are "voluntaryly giving up their personal responsibilities", which they briefly demonstrated after the collapse of the USSR.
"What do you think?"
This phenomenon concerns all social classes, including the commercial world.
The official elite also intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (of the total number of 85 heads of Russian regions) run local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, a synonym for chaos.
Public opinion gives priority to stability.
Also, in the name of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
Tamary Crédničenko's conclusion, 40-year-old professors: "What do you think?
Those in power aren't so bad, so why change them?"
Loaded Memory
After more than sixty years in a reliable regime, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which count the fates of 17.5 million victims of Hitler's regime, open up to the public.
47 million archive documents stored 27 km long in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were available only for "humanitarian" purposes, which means individually and on behalf of the former victim or its authorised persons.
Eleven States entrusted with the management of archives - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed to open them to scientists and historians in May.
In view of the fact that the process of ratification of this Agreement by all States is at the end of last night, the opening took effect.
Other information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow to examine "particularly the movement of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of health of workers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, there have been several states, including Germany, against the making available of these nominal public documents, due to the sensitive nature of some information.
What are the expected homosexuality or mental injury of some of the victims of deportation.
The registers of concentration camps or arresters compiled by the Gestape were gathered after the war for the practical purpose of finding the deported or forced work of the civil citizens, to give them proof of their detention with a view to opening the way for their compensation.
Today more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen deal with tens of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is only a limited benefit.
"There is nothing new about these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for the Study of Anti-Semitism of Berlin Technische Universität, in 2006.
EU and India want to reach free trade agreements in 2008
Bilateral trade between Europe and India is currently reaching EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect the signing of the Free Trade Agreement in 2008, announced by the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers gave a green European Commission to start negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the South-East Asian States (Asean). Bilateral trade between Europe and India is now reaching EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, however, India is, according to the European Commission, up to the ninth EU trading partner.
"The Free Trade Agreement is a great boost to both economies" and "India is gaining better access to the 450 million prosperous Europeans market," Peter Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported to India, the European Commissioner explained. The Asian and European giant together annually changes "47 billion euros in goods" and "ten billion euros in services", said this week Daniele Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its full potential". The EU and India meet at the eight joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi on Friday, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singha and European Commission President José Manuel Dura Barroso.

The English bank raised concerns and offered 10 billion pounds in a five-week auction
On Thursday, the English bank announced that it was intended to reduce the current concern that the conditions on the credit market would be further worse and announced 10 billion pounds in a five-week auction for a basic interest rate of 5,75 %, an offer not usually valid for a long time.
"In an effort to ease the fears that the conditions on financial markets will be very adverse at the end of the year and give banks greater security in the way that ensures their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserves during the maintenance period, which begins on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation", the Communication reported.
The Bank makes it clear that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the financial market on 6 December at 12.15 GMT until 10 January, at a basic interest rate.
It seems to be the first thing that BOE is pumping cash on the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
They usually last a week.
In its communication, the BOE adds that "is still prepared to take further measures to maintain intermediate interest rates" interbank loans at the same level with their basic rate.
The average interbank interest rate was 5,829 % on average.
The three-month interest rate was set at 6,6 %, which is the highest since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the annual financial crisis, the amounts placed on the financial market by the English bank have been linked to the fees charged by the banks from the use of this offer.
According to certain speculations reinforced by the evolution of the euro pound rate, many prefer to decide on the amounts placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more secure discretion.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire, Union for People's Movement) and NC (New Centre, New Centre) refuse to address the proposals of the Socialists (PS) on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre clubs refused to discuss on Thursday the individual paragraphs of the Socialist proposal of the Law on Buyability, which is equal to the rejection of the text.
At the beginning of the day, the text of the bill was obtained under the so-called socialist "nursing" (the meeting initiated by the individual MP club) and contained dozens of measures taken by the PS Presidency Tuesday, including an increase in the employment premium of 50 %, renewal of collapsing TIPS, transport check or rental regulation.
In view of the fact that the UMP and the NC voted against the individual paragraphs (180 votes against 115), the meeting was closed after the general debate, which became an opportunity for an exchange of views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, several hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television show on the purchasing power.
The Head of Members of PS Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club will re- submit these proposals in full in the form of addendums to the amending proposal for the Finance Act, which will be discussed next week in November.
A new festival is born
As a result of many speculations that C3 Presents in Philadelphia is setting up a new festival, this promoter/producer Vineland Festival in New Jersey announced in cooperation with the Festival of the Republic of the British Order of Melvin Benn.
"It is an honor for our company to work with a person who has inspired the current festival movement in America without any overlap," said Charlie Jones from the Billboard.com C3 server.
C3 is produced by the Chicago Festival Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland in New Jersey is a summer camper target station.
The festival should be held from August 8th to 10th on a private farm of 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic Festival, formerly known as the Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most famous festival rangers.
In 1989, Cormide Reading Festival was held in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added to his portfolio Leeds Festival, in 2006 the Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
The year 2002 begins with Melvin Benn, a co-owner, also in the care of production, licenses and organizational tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which currently has up to 177 500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 refers to Glastonbury as "the most inspiring event", which he has ever experienced and says his company and Melvina Benna are working at the same time to give the region a festival event of European style.
"In the beginning, we chose Philadelphia as a market, and together with the Fairmount Parks Commission, we worked hard to set up a festival in central Philadelphia," claims Charlie Jones.
"I talked to the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, however, because of the city's current leadership, we're in the middle of politics, Charlie Jones.
"Unfortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Ben and we are going to set up a great festival in an exceptional place that will serve the residents of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents in 2005 raised the Lollapalooz festival in the Chicago Grant Park, after having emerged in 2002 on the festival scene by organizing the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The gross market for both events for 2007 was $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both of these festivals are held in the urban environment.
"The European model of the Melvina Benna festival is taking place in the countryside, while our festivals are taking place on green beaches in the cities," says Charlie Jones.
Our aim is to make a certain way of both concepts so that we can create both the perceptions of the rural festival in Europe and the city in America."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Obec Vineland, including the mayor, warmly supports the realization of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The last appointed person refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, however, claims that "they are useful enough to allow them to invest in such an event and welcome the festival that will have, hopefully, a long-term duration".
Charlie Jones says that the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to the capacity of Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which will include 80,000 people.
He says the groups have already been sent invitations, but nothing can yet be confirmed when the program is just being printed.
"Vineland will have rock noodles, but music will be there, if possible, to attract a wide range of viewers," says Carlie Jones.
C3, who received the top Independent Promoter award in the last year of Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal Head of Terminator
It's not easy to attach Hollywood film studios to Montreal, when the Terminator...
This conviction mission is one of the tasks of the delegates.
His mandate, however, is "politically demanding" because Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to get the Governor into the traps?
"Be careful, it's industry that decides where to go.
If he finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, he'll go there.
Our role is to offer those that they will consider to be the best," he said.
Honba for festivals
At the moment, however, Denise Turcottea is the priority of promoting local film.
It's already starting to be the honour of Oscar.
At all the festivals of the West Coast, whether in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or in San Francisco, it is about presenting Québec films, paying attention to them and ensuring that the directors provide interviews.
A few weeks ago, he had good publicity at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month Quebec also presented four short films and four entire evening films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Does the end of the year come at the marathon stock exchange? The experts have divided the 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year, and the investors are already holding their hands to expect the traditional marathon to come at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so sure it will come to him.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December at the stock exchange is a positive period".
However, forecasts should not be created solely on the basis of statistics, especially because, at least for a short time, certain doubts exist in current market relations."
These experts do not assume that the stock exchange has changed over the last few weeks and state that "the stock market remains liquid, which is prepared to invest in view of the missing alternatives with guarantees, especially a firm income affected by the return on quality securities, both in the long term and in the short term".
This is why they believe that the stock exchange will have a more peaceful course, not without volatility, "particularly because it is not known the impact of the likely loss of FED (Federal Reserve System), given the high level of oil prices and the threat of inflationary pressures".
Javier Barrio, head of BPI's bank in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time for a bold statement that the marathon is coming.
"There are not too many reasons for joy," this expert assures.
Ibex lost almost 4 % of the maximum values recorded on 8 November when the index ended at 15,945.7 points.
However, all experts do not have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could end the year by something close to 16,000 points due to the transfer of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension insurance that occurs each year at this time.
This expert, however, suggests that this year will be a bit different because it is believed that the marathon will take place earlier, in the second week of December following the extended weekend at the occasion of the Constitution's Day.
The said analyst is not at home that the volatility would affect the direction of the market.
Federico Olucha, analyst Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching a technical level and "that is why we could observe the reflection of the index, which is called the US report on the consequences of the credit market crisis".
The analyst believes that these effects will be positive.
Analysts agree on the selection of titles that are taking care of bringing Ibex to a new maximum cat.
Solana from Intermoney confirms that this year is a series of strong titles.
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive".
On the contrary, Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco assures that growth will go hand in hand with banking and industry.
Construction companies will also be able to enrich this marathon if it comes to it.
"The ACS has been reinvigorated for several months and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, will go the same way," explains the expert.
cyclical consumption will be in the last part of the year in advance due to an increase in sales during the holiday sale period.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that technology will also be very good, even though there are not too many representatives on the Spanish market in this field.
Five times over seven years
In the last seven years, December was only two months of failure.
A real marathon took place at the end of the year in 2003, in the administrative year when stock markets ended the crisis caused by the explosion of the technology bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 was regained 28,17 %, the growth of 6,68 % was recorded in December.
We will see whether 2007 will be in line with the fifth profit year (i.e. Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it will succeed in having its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred popular bank branches will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
The Popular Bank has decided to modernise most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the popular Max brand are a big change for the bank.
Also for other Spanish entities, because it is the first group that decided to make such a jump and place on the uninterrupted opening time of its branches up to 20.30 hours and open on Saturday from 10 to 20.30 hours.
BBVA, another group that has also several times assured that it wants to extend the opening time of its branches, has not yet decided to do so.
In the meantime, it intends to conclude an agreement with the opening-up committees of 75 % of its branches on Saturday in exchange for the extension of the opening-up period by one afternoon, even if not for the public.
The results of this experience will be decisive for the Bank of Popular to be connected or not to other entities supporting the opening-up of the trading period.
That's exactly the purpose of the project that ran out of the Popular Bank.
Get individual customers who are publishing in these places behind their purchases, small and medium-sized companies, vigilants and shops from the selected streets, where they can open the branch.
The Bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain over about 18 months, because it is not about opening new branches, but only about the modification of existing ones.
For this reason, the bank is modernising the branches already in its trading areas by adapting the customer profile in individual streets.
The extension of the opening period is complemented by other features of the side area and new, more up-to-date design in brighter colors.
The bank manager of Ángel Rivera ensures that this restructuring will not mean a large investment, but a larger recruitment of staff, as it goes from six employees to eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with premises for meetings of small and medium-sized enterprises and will sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
Banka Popular has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Angel River explains.
The branches were selected in the Madrid streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía, and according to Rivera it seems that it was a happy choice.
Banka Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And the other 60 specialists on immigrants who are operated under the Mondocredit brand also have a very long opening time and opened even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model when a number of its branches offer a large scale of non-financial products for sale.
"We don't want to compete with our clients," says Rivera.
They just agreed with Telefónico on the sale of mobile phones through external staff.
Telecinco for the first time on the stock exchange doubled the value of his rival Anteny 3
We did it.
Last night Paolo Vasile, Executive President Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the conclusion of the trade, when he found that the television he was driving doubled the value of his rival Anteny 3.
Only one thing said his joy: 'What I'm sorry about is that it didn't happen because we would grow more, but because we've fallen less', he said.
And then he stressed that thanks to the weak market, 'we've fallen less'.
Telecinco finished trading by 2.54 % yesterday.
This profit has moved their loss by the end of the year to 15,66 %.
The exchange value of this company controlled by Mediasem (with 52% of the capital) for Vocent's participation (other 13%) thus amounts to EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg.
Her rival Antena 3, which dropped by 1.52% yesterday and dropped by 40,5% from January, has a half-value of 2,193,46 million.
The value of other telecommunications companies that have been assessed amounts to 3,571 billion in Sogecable, 2,518,53 million Prisa (publisher Cinco Días) and 1,779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 offers, because 'we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we can do this on the same market at what price and how we evaluate it in monitoring.'
Telecinco announced last week that this year it is calculated that by overcoming billions of gross advertising revenues, he will become the first television channel, as confirmed by Giuseppe Tringali, executive president Telecinco and Publiespaña, who provides advertising for the group.
If the forecast data were actually obtained, this television channel would record an increase of 3,6 % in the advertising turnover compared to 965,4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, the net turnover of Antenna increased by 1,6 % (and reached 734,4 million), while net revenues of this television increased by 0,7 % (630,4 million).
One of the factors to which analysts focus is for the best relative development of Telecinco at the stock exchange is an increased payout, which has been maintained so far: in 2006 this company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, divided between its shareholders by 100 % of its profits.
Vasile ensures that, although it is soon to be decided, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33 % of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official obligation to give at least 50%, although we have always announced much more.
This year I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, which we have already raised the value of 33% of Endemolu'.
According to market analysts, at these times, there is a certain deterioration.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its Telecinco profit estimates by 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due to the explanation that the expected growth of revenue from 0,5 % to 8,4 % in 2008 and from 5,5 % to 5,1 % in 2009.
The company's Tataz reduced the expected Anteny 3 profit by 4,5 % in 2008 and 7,5 % in 2009.

Congress approved the transposition of MiFID as of 1 November
In parallel with the parliamentary proceedings, which have been concluded today by the vote of the Congress on novels incorporated by the Senate in the draft law, the government has subjugated the public hearing of the regulations that are developing the new law with the aim of bringing both into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the individual parties agreed on the efforts of the MPs and senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard to ensure the protection of investors and the detailed regulation of the activities of the entities necessary for the effective functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which amends the Securities Trading Act, provides for the modernisation of financial markets and at the same time reinforces investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the State Securities Markets Commission (CNMV) and supports cooperation between individual supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will enable financial consulting services to be provided to specialised companies, both natural or legal persons and will create a new type of financial services providers (ESIS), financial consulting companies (AFI), which are connected to a securities company, a brokering office with securities and a portfolio management company.
In addition, the number of operating systems with financial instruments is widened by joining the regulated secondary markets with multi-party trading and internalisation systems of orders that will compete with current stock exchangers.
The Act further obliges investment services to disseminate on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and risk-to-risk balance and requires a list of all operations carried out to simplify supervision by the CNMV.
During the discussion in the Congress Trade Committee, several amendments were included, which resulted in a "complicated" financial instrument being considered to be a high risk to the investor, which was demonstrated by the high-risk mortgage debt (subprime) in the United States.
The transposition of the Directive has also been used to legalise functions that can prevent baccalators in the field of economics and business management 30 years after the Royal Decree was passed in 1977, which excludes professional functions reserved for economies.
At the same time, the Senate has organised the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as the intermediary who will work externally, will not require permission from CNMV and will be able to provide product trading services and customer acquisition services for different investment companies at the same time.
In November, the harmonised ISC increased by five tenths to 4,1 %
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat to calculate the European Union's inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices developed in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication is in line with the policy of Eurostat and the Central European Bank (ECB) to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This provisional indicator is calculated for the same process as is used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but for the use of different statistical modelling methods for estimates of information that are not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Statistical Institute) recalled that the information provided by this provisional indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily have to correspond with the final data available on 14 December of this year.
"ISC will continue to be maintained at relatively high levels"
The Second Vice-President of the Government and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes announced that the November increase of ISC to 4.1% is "a temporary number", however, he predicted that the price index will continue to be at a relatively high level in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes in the Koloárs of Congress has clarified that "even if it is not a positive number", the inflation differential in Spain towards the monetary union is still "more or less" in the last two years.
He also explained that November was "less surprising" than the previous month, when the government did not count with such a high increase.
"We expected a value of about 4%," the Minister of Economic Affairs introduced the data presented today.
Virgin plans to make 42 billion euros with Northern Rock over three years
Since the fall of September, the Bank of Northern Rock has been in crisis and has had to withdraw to the bank of England's emergency loan, its deposits have fallen by more than 50% to 12 billion pounds (16.8 billion euros).
At that time, the bank corrected the record deposits worth more than 25 billion pounds, which gradually dropped customers over two and a half months, despite the fact that the government offered a prudential guarantee for this money and extended it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who replaces the entity's commercial financial mark with Virgin Money, needs to get around a quarter of the revenues invested in British banks over the next three years to get the remaining 18 billion pounds and achieves 30 billion.
A group of magnet Richard Branson, known in the United Kingdom as his imaginary advertising campaign, plans to lose 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually for advertising and marketing in order to reach its chairmanship.
The Bank of Northern Rock this week marked the offer of the Virgin consortium, which forms another three companies, such as the one that gives the advantage of saving them from bankruptcy.
Old Town of Totany arrested for alleged corrupt practices in construction
Today, the civil guard detained the current mayor of the city of Totana (of the People's Party) in the early hours of the building, because of his alleged involvement in corrupt practices that had been discovered this week.
One of the counsellor's secretary and local police chief were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current human MP and until then the mayor of the village, who, according to the research sources of the TV broadcasts of Cadena SER, could be the 'head' of the whole company.
Politicians continue to monitor the construction of councils and commissions and are not exempt from further arrests in the next few hours.
In addition, a lawyer named Juan Morales, the chief suspect of corrupt practices in the construction, was accused of having been discovered at the beginning of this week.
As Cadena SER, a 'lidoveck' lawyer from MP Juan Morales, who was examined yesterday, was arrested on leaving Morales' home with important documents related to corruption.
In addition, according to the research sources, morales' alleged selection of commissions for its signature of a building agreement with a Galician construction company, which has been reclassified 200 hectares of land, is the subject of an investigation.
At the moment, eight people are detained.
Bono accepted the offer to stand in front of the Toledo candidate PSOE and, if they win, to President Congress
The former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of Socialists José Luis Rodríguez Zapater to stand in the next general elections in front of the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) in Toled and, in the event that the Socialists win general elections, became President of Congress.
So at the press conference, the PSOE secretary announced to José Blanco and Bono himself, following a meeting with Zapater, which took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of the party.
The chief executive of the offer to the former minister argued that in political life "it is important to count with the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He further noted that "yes, it seems", that this policy from La Manchy will be the candidate of the Socialist Party to the President of Congress, if the Socialists win in future elections.
As President of Congress, Bono would replace Manuel Marín, who published his decision on November 15th to ignore future general elections and to abandon his active political career so that he could devote himself to combating climate change in the framework of university education.
The former minister admitted that the president of the government constantly insisted on him to return to the top policy he left two years ago.
He further stated that, like citizens, who would be the Minister of Economy's job if PSOE won the election, his party wanted to announce, in a "transparent form", who would chair the Congress.
If Bono gets this function, he hopes that the Snow White will turn into "house of respect and never a hint or a scream" and that "he will become more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems, unfortunately, that the only place in Madrid where one cannot speak in peace and peace is Congress, the President of the Government of the Senate on one occasion interrupted 26 times."
Likewise, he expressed his praise at the address of current President Manuel Marín and his "good work" and did not want to imagine himself in his place so as not to be reduced to what his opponents might think of as "great."
Climate propaganda
In view of the fact that the movement against climate change is undermining the unmerciful persecution of those who are skeptical of its predictions, as well as those who prefer other political and social struggles, must show strong coherence.
Moreover, the leader of the movement, who is the president of the government like Zapatero, believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign "a new treaty with the planet".
This proposal makes it necessary to explain why the activity or inaction of its government has made a significant contribution to the fact that Spain leads in the European Union in the non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this failure, in which sectors, and why his government, the government of the treaty, did not prevent it.
In addition, it requires him to explain to the Spanish what measures he intends to take to speed up climate change.
Which companies will be damaged, which habits of the population will have to change, what energy savings, individual and collective, we will have to accept and what economic consequences this will have.
In other words, who sacrifices and who pays for saving the planet.
But we didn't wait for such an explanation, nor do we.
Just because you have to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Dear, uncomfortable and threatening business and private accounts.
Even one cent of the price of petrol, proposed by the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), seemed to Zapater so risky from the point of view of the elections that he quickly refused.
In other words, it is to save the planet in such a way that nothing is missing, pure propaganda, passwords that are of any real importance.
Effective phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And the covenants with the earth: this man is so useful to an electorate that doesn't speak, he doesn't make a charge, he doesn't demand, but he is a healer, and he stirs up.
If it's limited to being just a virtual contracting party and not asking us to ride a bike and cool the wind.
Mayor and local police chief Totany detained for suspected corruption in construction
As investigating sources were informed, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of Totana, the "people" of José Martínez Andreo, the chief of local police, the counsellor and one of the entrepreneurs in the shelter, for suspicion of committing crimes during the construction.
The mayor was arrested in his place of residence and transferred to the council, where he is now located with a number of police officers who have also arrived at the Commission for Construction and the Urban Enterprise for Industrial Lands and Apartments.
These three arrests came to the sixth, which occurred last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, during the operation associated with the reclassification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land on the ground suitable for the construction so that the Galician company Nuaria, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last election period, could build 4,000 houses.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested, but are accused of a short trial before the court of the first instance of Totana.
Six of the first prisoners were brought before the court today.
According to information sources, the former Mayor of Totany and today a member of the parliament of the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, are being investigated.
Furthermore, his former wife, the owner of the real estate office, was accused of being registered today in Totana and his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous area.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of the Nuaria group, lawyer and entrepreneur from Viga, was arrested in Niger (Pontevedra province), as well as Pablo José M. G., director of the company Suelo de Immonaur, which belongs to that group and has passed the charges below.
The investigation is carried out by a group for criminal offences in the construction of the Operational Central Unit of the Civil Guard, whose members, in addition to arrest, also carried out eleven visits, most of which are in companies related to the arrested, based in Madrid, Vigu, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (the province of Madrid) and Totany.
At that time, only one person was imprisoned in Totana, a well - known owner of the company for the products of poultry meat that he could serve as a mediator.
The Nuaria Group was entrusted with the establishment of the largest residential complex of the city of Totany, representing the construction of more than 5,000 houses, golf courses and two hotels with "spa".
The company gained 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which was reclassified and its project had to double the settlement of a village with 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonar, which are dedicated to support the real estate market, Conycase, which runs parking in the streets of Coruň, Venezuela and in the town of Fernando el Católica in Vigo, Hogartel, which is dedicated to direct marketing and Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and assembly of building elements.
And it happens.

Our Finnish writer sends us this comment from yesterday's edition of the most important Finnish news of Helsingin Sanomat (by the way, at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspaper published on November 18, on the Thursday of the occasion, and the criticism of the Blackburn book:
"The content of the subject of philosophy went into public discussions in connection with the tragedy at school in Jokel.
The victim's killer, a high school student, quoted in his messages the work of Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, a school counselor responsible for the subject of philosophy, asked on the pages of Helsingin Sanomat's journal to give a critical opinion to Plato and claimed that it is not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the basic course of philosophy at high schools."

One colleague informs about the introduction of a criminal offence of downloading from the Internet into a criminal code:
A. Downloading a song would be a criminal act with a rate from six months to one year.
On the contrary, if you cut the plate at a price of less than 400 euros, it is considered to be a mere breach (§ 623.1).
B. If you cut to 1000 euros in the shop, theft is already a criminal offence, but the criminal rate is lower than the charge (§ 234 of the criminal law).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than the charge (§ 244.1)
D. It's less important to participate in fights than changing the compacts.
Participating in expropriation has a rate from three months to one year (§ 154 of the criminal code) and for the exchange of compacts would be a rate from six months to two years.
(§ 270 of the criminal law).
E. Sexual harassment in employment is considered under § 184.2 of the criminal code less serious than downloading a film on DVD.
F. Unauthorized distribution of copyright-protected films is a vice sentencing rather than the provision of pornographic material to young people (§ 186).
So if my colleague's not wrong, she caught someone's hand, and it's okay.

My treating doctor tells me one of his strange research articles called "Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
Feelings that cause monthly payouts for employees depend on how many colleagues they earn.
The research was carried out at Bonn University using magnetic resonance on tomography and the results are published in the latest issue of Science magazine.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and lead group Viewing a neurologist of Life&Brain in Germany: "The biggest activation occurred when the research participant responded correctly and his colleague was wrong."
Research workers observed that if both were successful, they received the same pay, the activation was small, but when one received a double, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
Complaints against the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been infuriated for eight years by the State Prosecutor's Office of the Court of Justice in The Hague of the Balkan War.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year, and Carla will leave with mixed feelings, because the main culprits of the massacre in Srebrenica, where 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still free.
Their names are on the list, from which he took the name of the documentary film by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach "Karlin List" (2006, not quoted in Spain), which, at the speed of the detective thriller, follows from Belgrade to New York the work of the Swiss prosecutor in tracking refugees and pressure on the relevant states to withdraw the network.
What kind of insurance is appropriate for me?
Car insurance, which protects the driver in the event of an accident, represents a significant expenditure which depends on various factors such as age, status, sex, length of driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing a suitable vehicle insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to clarify what we're talking about.
Vehicle insurance is an agreement between the insurance undertaking and the insurer.
This commitment takes the form of an insurance contract which provides that the insurance undertaking will obtain an agreed amount of insurance at a certain amount for taking care of the payment damage in the event of an insurance event.
Insurance is the price of insurance, which is determined on the basis of different factors such as age, condition, sex, length of driving licence, type of vehicle which is insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies determine their prices on the basis of statistics, so the more likely the accident is the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both persons 25 years of age and women must pay lower insurance because statistics show that they have a lower risk index in view of their care.
In the same way, on the basis of the checks, insurance companies have concluded that married people have fewer accidents than free drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of the journey, and thus the likelihood of an accident.
The increase in the frequency of traffic is likely to increase.
There are many variables that the insurance companies consider when setting the insurance price.
Therefore, the driver must carefully examine the situation in order to choose which insurance is best suited to his insurance profile.
We will show here the most important variables for the choice of the type of insurance which, in addition to issuing the type of insurance, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under 50 years of age face various disadvantages, such as a lack of experience in driving and holding a driver's license when they want to sit secure at the price available.
Although it is ideal for good cover insurance against all risks, there are also cheaper options.
The more careful drivers can choose insurance against all risks with lower insurance so as to obtain insurance coverage of all risks but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would provide for the customer's participation in the insurance event.
"Part of the insurance compensation provided by the client will be determined in advance when determining the insurance price, which will be higher than the lower the participation would be", explains Luis Noguera, the leading company First Europe in Spain, the Internet insurance intermediary.
Another option is to extend insurance to other participants in the operation so that the client will ensure against damage to other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Recommendation.
If you are twenty-five years old, try to be careful and avoid accidents as it is only possible, because it will affect your bonus and enable you to reduce your insurance in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate of the insurance company.
On the contrary, small is an increase in the said basic rate.
"Bonus and small will depend on insurance and its profits.
If the insurance company has a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus," Noguera explains.
After crossing the border of twenty-five years, drivers will be easier when they get insurance, because the customer risk index decreases because of the experience gained.
For this reason, it is recommended to sit on insurance against all risks to be reduced.
"Young people usually cannot take advantage of the experience gained at the time of the accident, and not even when it comes," the director of the European company in Spain assures, and adds that most of the accidents occur in the second year of the event, when "the fear of the new one" has already been overcome.
However, if a client is married but has not yet children, it is better to take insurance against all risks if his economic situation permits.
Families with children are considered as a client with the lowest risk index and therefore their exposures will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with a lower insurance (which could cost 300 euros) or at a high bonus, insurance extended to other participants in the operation shall start a third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
"Their management is calmer and their purchasing capacity is higher, so they can afford the excess to get the highest discount," says Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are recommended to provide insurance against all risks with a discount of EUR 150 or insurance extended to other operating participants if a high bonus has been achieved.
It is important to say that car insurance is almost important not only because it protects drivers in the event of a accident, but also because it represents a significant expenditure, which is a good reason for the proper examination of the insurance options that we would most like to see in our personal situation.
Celtic is trying to get to AC Milan point, which means eight-dimensional
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their forces this Tuesday at the San Siro Stadium in an effort to get a point that they lack to achieve their respective goals at the conclusion of the league "Champions", because for Italy it would be the first and in Scotland it would decide to be a location.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured the procedure in the fifth remix match in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but it needs another one to be sure that Shachtör will not get ahead of him with six points, which will play with Benfika, who has four.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, as AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where it will first arrive at the thirteenth in the semifinal, in an attempt to go to the final, which is the sixteenth.
So this group will be closed before the other and final outcome at the Giuseppe Meazzi stadium seems to be most likely, even if both men try to fight for victory, because the Italians will not want to tacticalize on the home ground and Celtic knows that after the win it would be the first and will secure a better place in the eighth final.
The power of Gordon Fearana could be even lost if Shachčor did not win, but it cannot be relied on, because at the same number of nine points Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow last week (2:1) won in the first direct match (2:0).
And so AC Milan players will try to destroy the night of Scott, who believe that the second time they will get to the semifinal in the reorganized Champions League just as they beat them in the same game in the last race of the Coke ball in the length (1:0) after the status 0:0 in the basic playing time.
Hope that they will win the "rosoneri" will be the chessman for whom he has the prize of victory, only if Celtic loses, both for the course of the eight finals and for the defeat of UEFA.
Benfica, although it is last and has no chance to continue in the highest European competition, could achieve a third place with one victory, so it would play in the UEFA.
The first concert in the Spice Girls tour took place in Vancouver with 20,000 people
Spice Girls group started in Vancouver, Canada, before 20,000 viewers their first tour since it split in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they started their concert at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver, they said that the re-connection of their group was "big".
About 20,000 people bought tickets to be present at a concert, which also included videos depicting the history of this group, which sparked a sensation at the end of the 1990s.
Returns and world tours are played at the same time as new albums are released by the EMI in Spain, which brings the choice of their main successful collections, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five Spice Girls appeared on the scene in a decorated bracelet given to their husband "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham.
This sportsman was in the audience who sailed GM Place, although nervous Victoria banned him a few days ago.
Prior to the beginning of the show, Victoria Beckham said about the British star that "he didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he thinks of the show."
"Sporty Spice", whose departure from the band in 1998 "due to disagreements between us" caused two years later the release of the five-year-old group, also revealed its nervousness in meeting with the reporters two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world's public opinion has changed, the view of Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought, "Why not, so I'm glad I've decided," Chisholm said about the reuniting of the group that she released herself nine years ago.
The singer also noted that, in time, "the people were balanced and we all love each other very much."
However, many things have changed since Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
So at the beginning, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver by Virgin Airlines special.
On arrival, an army of sheep was waiting for them at the airport.
Five has a total of 7 children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the group will be held in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
It will be held in Madrid on 23 December.
Supplys from a new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
Russia-Ukraine is currently in the process of dealing with the prices of natural gas, thereby increasing the risk that Russian supplies of this fuel may be affected in Western Europe.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is run by pipes across Ukraine and any dispute between these two countries is closely monitored.
Kyev warned that if Moscow raises Ukraine's gas price, Russia will charge higher transit charges.
The previous dispute between the two last year reduced deliveries to the EU states.
The latest dispute between Kyiv and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge more to Ukraine because it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas it receives from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its Gazprom deliveries.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in the course of the negotiations," said Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoli China, Reuters.
"The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit charges (to Western Europe) across Ukraine."
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kyiv led to a reduction in supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This led to a sharp drop in exports to Western Europe, leading to a sharp increase in prices.
Russian gas represents one quarter of supplies to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas stocks in the world, but most of them remain underutilized.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS "needs to control foreign employees"
The controller said that the Scottish NHS Chambers must improve the control of criminal records among non-European employees.
The recommendation from the president of the highest control office of Robert Black came after the foreign doctor acting in Scotland was linked to the June attacks at Glasgow Airport.
Mr Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS does not have an accurate understanding of the amount of foreign staff employed.
But his report stressed that other key controls were carried out in line with the sample of five health authorities.
The President of the highest control authority was immediately interested in the June attacks at the Glasgow airport on personnel from outside the European Economic Area.
Eighteen-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone hired Jeep to build the main terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court using a video bridge accused of tying up the bombing attempts in Britain.
The NHS Chamber is expected to monitor foreign personnel from the point of view of qualifications, experience and authorisation for work in the United Kingdom prior to their employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commissions are using the Discoverure Scotland for the control of criminal records, this agency has no power to obtain such information outside Britain.
The report by the President of the High Control Authority states, in addition to other recommendations, that the Commission should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau directives, which assists employers with controls in several countries.
"Although we have found that part of staff records contained evidence of these checks, they are not carried out regularly," the report announced.
Mr Black said that the Scottish NHS is in many ways in line with its own policy of pre-employment checks, but also added: "Our report points to areas in which the system could be improved in order to ensure the availability of accurate information on the quantity of foreign personnel."
The president of BMA Scotland Dr. Peter Terry said it is "very unlikely" that pre-employees' checks would identify potential employees of NHS who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report indicates that the current pre-employment controls in the Scottish NHS are working well and it is not clear what further value those comments will bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities have announced that there are 1,161 foreign workers currently, most of whom are doctors and sisters.
However, the President of the High Control Authority pointed out that these numbers would probably also be higher because the Commission should have a problem identifying staff with a residence permit.
The investigation also found that the controls introduced by NHS authorities in the fields of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely carried out.
They included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently working on the policy and guidelines for pre-employment checks for NHS foreign workers.
Minister of Health Nicola Sturgeon said, "I wanted to set up this work immediately after the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It also added that the Scottish Government, in accordance with the health commissions, would consider the recommendations of this report and ensure that the best procedures appeared in the updated guidelines for pre-employment checks on all staff, including those of foreign personnel, planned to be issued next month.
Joy Division controls movie prices
Control, a video about the deceased singer Joy Division Ian Curtis, collected five prizes at the British Independent Film Awards, including prizes for the best film.
Prices were also awarded by the star Sam Riley, who worked to the role of Curtis in the warehouse, director Anton Corbijn and in the side role of Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was named the best actress for a thriller Scandal entry.
And the band star Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for getting a British movie on the world scene.
Prices were celebrated in the London Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis' way to glory with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black and white film - whose soundtrack contains The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - stood only 3 million pounds.
But he won a Dutch photographer Corbinov, formerly known for his iconic album U2 Joshua Tree, two prizes - for the best regime and for the best debuting director.
Rock music was the focus of another rated - because Juliena Temple film about the singer Clash Joe Strummer won the prize for the best document.
The record for the best actor was won by Viggo Mortensen as the driver of the Russian Mafia boss in the London thriller David Cronenberg Eastern pledge.
Ray Winston, who has a reputation based on the roles of hard guys, won Richard Harris' prize for an extraordinary benefit to the British film.
This 50-year-old, including Scum, Neil By Mouth, and Sexy Beast, is now filming the next part of Indiana Jonese - Kingdom of the crystal skull.
Winston said he's proud of this price, which is named after Camelot's star and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened the door for people like me," he added.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, a great actor of my time, I'm very honored."
Independent film prices, known as Biffs, are awarded by the jury, where filmmakers, actors and festival organizers are held.
Between the stations and the Bif patrons are Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbott.
Saudi Arabia arrested 208 people for terrorist conspiracy
Yesterday, Saudi Arabia announced that 208 militants were arrested for membership in cells preparing an immediate attack on oil facilities and also on spiritual and security components.
The state television of the largest oil exporter reported that one of the cells wanted to inject rockets into the country.
The supporters of al-Qaeda led a campaign against the monarchy, the United States' allies, from 2003 to the invasion of Iraq.
The TV reported that a cell of eight militants led by a foreigner was planning an attack on an oil facility in the province of Ash-Sharqiyah.
Saudi Arabia builds a rapid reaction unit of 35,000 members to defend equipment from an unscrupulous al-Qaeda attack on the world's largest oil processing factory in Abqaiqu in 2006.
The report quoted the Ministry's internal declaration: 18 prisoners belonged to a cell led by the "expert on rocket firing", which he passed into the country.
She further stated that the militants were planning to overthrow eight shots into the kingdom.
22 detainees were to prepare the murders of spiritual and security workers.
The government urged the clergy to try to prevent Saudis from leaving Iraq to join the Al-Qaeda militants fighting the united armies and the Shishak government, the United States supported by the conservative Sunnits of Saudis.
Al-Qaeda militants believe that the authorities have co-opted many religious leaders in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that governs the government.
Militanti - supported by the challenges of the leader al-Qaeda Saúda Usám bin Ládina to focus on the Western Saudi government - focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort of security forces in the past... five months," said the Ministry of Interior's State TV.
A 16-member "medial cell" was also arrested in Medina, which was intended to promote "takfirian thinking" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which supports violence against Muslims marked as unbelievers and apostates.
There were also 32 prisoners accused of providing financial support to militants.
The climate on Venus is perhaps a view of the future of the Earth
Scientists yesterday announced that Venus could ever be a pleasant place to live.
Data from the current European station show that the planet is even more similar to the Earth's own twin than it used to be.
Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor of the Earth.
These two worlds are about as big and are running on similar jewels, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus had conditions similar to those on Earth and could also be inhabited.
But the cooled glass effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion of solar radiation and lower turn speed sent Venus on a completely different path of development.
Today the planet is waterless, the temperature on the surface is hot enough on the roof of the lead, and it is released by storms and winds of the force of hurricanes.
The findings of the European Space Agency Venus Express, which has been studying the planet for one year, offer a close look at how the Earth could develop in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor from Oxford University of Physics and one of the leading Venus Express missions said: "It is even clearer why the climate on Venus is so different than on Earth, even though the planets themselves are quite similar.
"Our new data enables us to draw up a scenario in which Venus began as well as the Earth, perhaps with the living environment, billions of years ago."
Police kept the "rich uranium"
Kilo of radioactive material, supposedly enriched uranium, was detained by the Slovenian and Hungarian police yesterday.
The police spokesman stated that three people were detained and the material was tested.
He did not claim to be a enriched uranium, but said that the substance could be sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
It's still fine.
Mitt Romney said that it is not appropriate for presidential candidates to answer the snow question.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidates later agreed with the debate on YouTube, in which the ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and handed them over to the decommissioned candidates.
None of the questions posted on Wednesday 28 November were as comical as snowflake, which asked the Democrats about global warming in the debate of the other party on YouTube.
But questions and answers this time have reflected many of the Republican parties' position towards the elections next year.
It is not clear how exactly CNN producers, one of the sponsors of the debate, chose the clips that were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half of the debate, the longest time devoted to the single theme, was focused on immigration.
This theme is one of the most powerful Republican themes.
CNN asked the panel of undecided voters to turn around with a cat when they heard something delightful: the voter recorded the tops of the agreement when the candidates talked about hard access at the borders.
The strongest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giuliani, the main national candidate, and Mr Romney, who went ahead in key rapid votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr Giuliani is trying to establish the reputation of a man who was as the prime minister of New York soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Governor of Massachusetts of hireing illegal immigrants to work at his home.
These two were particularly curious when the hostages asked whether any of the candidates would support the "amnesty" (to give illegal immigrants a normal position and the possibility of citizenship).
The next candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Congressman from Colorado, were able to adapt their little to the mill on this topic.
None of these two have a chance to nominate, but both of them remain in the game, perhaps because they started beating on fire for immigration earlier and stronger than the others.
At least in terms of immigration, candidates have a similar view: greater emphasis on borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, together with concerns from the angry toys from China and other concerns with the surrounding world, helps the Republicans to forget or minimize the conflict between libertine and Christian conservatives.
But the debate began to be very unpleasant when it came to other issues.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported the holding of the gun in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney were discussing whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One secretary asked whether the candidates believed every word in the Bible.
As a result, Giuliani concluded that even though the Bible is his favorite book, he does not literally believe the story of Jonah and his election.
Another hostage asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now against all the assumptions in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa due to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said that the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, Jesus said that he was too clever to run for the cause of laughter.
The fight remains unusually open.
The growth of Mr. Huckabee in Iowa is covered with recent success in obtaining money and the vocal joy of Ron Paul during the middle debate.
These two were reflected from the bottom, because both sides' wings are still unable to agree on more familiar and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates joined the party very soon and convincingly with a winning report on American size on lips, marking both sides.
This time, the party is disbanded and the result is far from uniform.
Labourers’ Diseases
Gordon Brown again found a trap to fall into; his path remains the same.
Although it is common for British political scandals, it is not particularly shocking.
It does not seem that there would be any rules being sold, no bills in the Paris hotel were secretly paid, no extra-marriage rings would be served.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown would go without revealing that after four years, a wealthy businessman masked contributions from the ruling Labour Party of $6500,000 ($1.3 million) under the names of other people, and that the party did not report it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided the election and insulted the British intelligence by claiming that this decision was not affected by the investigation, there was hope that it would ensure a strong and effective government.
Instead of formulating it as much as the most embarrassing representative president of the Liberal Democrats, once terrified Mr. Brown changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unencumbered rescue of the Northern Rock problem bank showed weaknesses in the management and faulty judgment under the fire.
Bad ideas on the amendment of the tax law linked companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people revealed an unimaginable administrative precedent.
Three generals in retirement started a riot in the House of Lords; protested against the cuts in military spending, for they claimed that being a commander of armed forces was part-time work.
Now there are many gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the secretary - general of the laborers (and their former observer of internal discipline), has already confessed.
None of this means that Mr. Brown would be turning back to his end.
Even so, governments can reach a point of overlap that they face with difficult governance.
People don't believe in politicians, and they don't like them, but most people take away their distrust when we take over a new party.
When it seems clear that some prime minister is probably not doing anything better and must not be in the office for a long time, this is a withdrawal: the government is becoming a bully, the ministers are starting to do briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government is becoming unfocused and defensive.
In one way, Mr Brown's position is particularly complex, because unlike other political leaders, you can't take the position of a new basket.
As far as he'd like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the accounts of the Financial Office are linked to the decisions that Mr Brown made as Minister of Finance.
And even though he wasn't directly involved in the blasphemous disasters, such as the long-term investigation into the financing of political parties caused by the "values for money", voters can quietly conclude that he was.
Still, Mr. Brown's hate isn't as bad as they look.
Those overcrowds aren't as horrible as the conservatives do.
As for Mr. Bean, no one died or was exposed to deception.
And the treatment, however painful it may be, is to provide what Mr. Brown's Stalinist trend always promised: a reliable, solid and easy brutal government.
The latest trend around political gifts is a good example.
Mr. Garboid Abrahams, who compares his gifts to charity, says that he did not want any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision was not on him.
The laws against anonymously big political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abraham's procedure, but did not know that it was illegal, would certainly be thoroughly questioned; likewise, Jon Mendlesohn, the chief laborer of the money, who learned about the broken gifts in October.
But so far, Mr. Brown is not at all involved; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these birds, even though the main part of the payments took place after his arrival in June.
The Prime Minister has already done half the work.
He quickly condemned this violation of the laws by his own party, but he made his decision by seeking a certified instrument, the committee for investigating this matter, which was also led by the bishop in retirement and the judge.
In this case, training is not complicated.
If the law was violated, it's about the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, such as finding a permanent chairman independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, who has no one for six months, and actually act as a reformer for the financing of political parties.
This would require the Labourers who are in a difficult position to cooperate with the Conservative and perhaps give up their special financial relationship with the committees - the bitter pills for a dedicated party like Mr. Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
The conservatives now have a good start in the research; he has two years to get back the voters; and the only way to win is unmistakable integrity and high competence.
Carat sharks
Does the crisis affect the US credit card mortgages?
When blood is in the water, naturally they start to mix backflows with excitement around them.
Now that the American real estate market is burning, the predators have focused on the darkest credit card market.
The analysts of Goldman Sachs say that losses on credit cards could be made if the underlying mortgages infected other versions of consumer loans could reach $99 billion.
The voltage signals are visible.
Increased number of cases of inability to pay (for more than 30 days of late payment) and of invoiced accounts (accounts considered to be ineligible by the supplier).
The HSBC bank announced last month that it had lost $1.4 billion on the US consumer credit market - also due to non-solvency loans on credit cards.
But he's panicking so soon.
The invoices and the inability to pay are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody's, 3.89% of the rate of incapacity for payment in the third quarter was almost the entire percentage point below average.
Decreasing levels may be partially explained by technical reasons.
The 2005 amendment to US Personal Bankruptcy Laws led to a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcys, which are making a large part of the losses on credit cards; the number of claims (and thus the number of copies) would therefore fall, regardless of whether the general conditions for the borrowers had been breached.
The sector also shows a good level of maturity, which shows how many consumers pay monthly out of their debts.
And trust in securities secured by credit cards is strong, even through paralysis in other aspects of structured finance.
Mr. Dennis Moroney, from the TowerGroup research company, predicts that the volume of their emissions in 2007 will be 25% higher than the average.
The direct routes to spread the infection between the crises of the underlying mortgages and the credit card market are definitely there: when they borrow property loans, consumers are more dependent on credit cards.
Credit card issuers, however, are looking at the cash flow rather than the value of hand-held items, so falling home prices do not necessarily mean a change in the confidence of the borrowers.
They can even be beneficial to the lenders.
The motivation of consumers to pay the mortgages is reduced when their property value decreases below the loan value; as a result, the debt on the cards is moved up on the priority list to pay.
The card issuers can also respond more quickly and more flexibly to more stormy conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid changes in the price of hand-held items.
"It doesn't happen that we'd just reassess all the loans once in a beautiful morning," says Gary Perlin, the financial manager of Capital One.
Although the risk of an explosion is low in the form of underlying mortgages, the risk of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower home prices and debt reduction push America into recession, the credit card sector will face a darker future.
Watch out for those backseats.
British bankers admitted guilt in the case of Enron
Three British bankers, who were to be tried for their role in the fraud associated with the former financial leader Enron Andrew Fastew, changed the statement and admitted guilt on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew originally guilty in seven accusations of fraud, when they were supposed to participate in the financial fraud in 2000 -- to be rich on behalf of their employers -- they argued.
They were supposed to be in January before the trial.
However, during the trial trial before US periodic judge Ewing Werley Jr., everyone admitted to one fraud.
The case of these three former employees of Greenwich NatWest, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC units, was on the front pages for the entire two years of publishing.
In the United States, their case is one of the unclosed parts of the investigation initiated at the end of Enron in 2001.
The charges brought against them in 2002 were pointed out by Mr Fastow that he was the aim of the government's investigation of Enron's fracture.
The complaint against the bankers -- who served the nickname "NatWest Three" -- claims that in 2000 they came to Houston to invent a fraud together with Fastwe and his former chief cousin Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in Enron's partner branch controlled by Fastew, who was an architect of a lot of enrontic frauds that enroned in the direction of a spiral to declare bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank assessed its share of this zero, but our three British knew that it actually had a significant value.
The company under Kopper's control bought a share of the bank in this branch for $1 million.
Incriminating bankers paid Kopper a share of $250,000 in this company.
According to Fastow's complaint, Enron misinformed that the energy company will pay 20 million dollars for its share in this branch of Greenwich NatWest.
However, 20 million actually went to those British bankers, Fastov and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million complaints and Fastow, Kopper and the others added about 12.3 million dollars.
In January 2004, Fastow admitted guilt in two cases of conspiracy for his role in the destruction of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in the federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is in execution for three years and one month in a plant in Texarkan.
All three Brits moved to bailout $1 million, which ordered them to stay in the United States for the upcoming trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, retired into bankruptcy in December 2001, after the years of accounting tricks it was no longer possible to hide billions of debts or to show a failed speculation as profit.
The collapse has abolished thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion of market value and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
The founder of Enrona Kenneth Lay and former chief employee Jeffrey Schilling were convicted last year for their role in the collapse of society.
Schilling is in execution for more than 40 years.
Judgments over Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were eliminated after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow non-power
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and a sufficient amount of fuel for nonstop flights from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, however, it is small to return.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, representative of the Gulfstream.
"But none of them is interested in so many places because it's for a close family or firm president."
Mr. Firer sat in the Gulfstream station last Friday at the Millionary Exhibition, which is the four-day orgy of the consumable in the mother exhibition centre on the periphery of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, its stands were built over 200 other luxury suppliers, who hoped that freshly rich Russians would lean on everything from the mahogany jackets made of diamond-made car trailers that would not be ashamed of.
Mr. Firer took a careful look at the clear orange Porsche in the adjacent station.
"It's a nice car, but it's against us five and ten," he said.
"Russia is the second largest private aircraft market in the United States."
On the waves of the oil, the capital of Russia collects money just as much as it had his days in Dallas.
"We passed the same stage in the 1980s, when some Americans were enormously rich and moved to Europe, where they looked at them as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year listener at Davis's Russian and Euro-Asian Studies Centre at Harvard.
Like the Soviets, the 70s and the 1990s, the Russians become the most prominent losers in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for this Klondike.
Another place in Moscow this week was the conference of the luxury industry Donatell Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of the LVMH Group, to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods on markets such as Russian.
(The Conference organises The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times Company.)
According to the list of the richest people in Forbes magazine, Russia has 53 billion dollars in total.
In addition, the local main institute in the field of Center for Economic and Financial Research has reported on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103 000 "cooperative" millionaires in Russia, whose total assets amount to $670 billion.
(The World Bank indicates that in 2005 15.8% of the Russians lived below the threshold of an existing minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of the London clergy, David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are perfectly adjusted, and men are all appointed."
When they went through the evening dress on Sunday night halls, Evgenia Yumatov's one and a half years old and five years older Svetlana Turovcov's self and their clients marked for the millionaires.
"I was looking at those cars and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Ms. Yumatov, who dressed in a brand-new clothing like a veteran of red carpets, with which Joan Rivers looks like a domestic duck.
The fair seemed to be focused primarily on fresh rich people, markedly controlled Russian buyers, who are willing to spend a few hours in road traffic so that they can go through the warehouses that are circularly mixed by Cadillacy Escalade, platinum fish, frozen Mövenpick, culinary tables in peace, apartments in Dubai, gund dumplings and sinks.
Members of the public could buy tickets for €30 (US$44.57).
"The Russians are interested in what brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stable of the Dutch porcelain Royal Delft before the reproduction of Rembrandt's image from hand painted blue tiles in life size.
"Of course the Russians are interested in more gold."
And, indeed, here sellers say that the Russians with old money (according to the Russian measurements are 10 to 15 years old) have already moved from the flash logs to a few well-known limited editions that would never appear on the shopping fair.
Even a few thousand people, whether millions already, millions of envoys, or free tourists, have flown through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ersov, the local general manager of King Koil's bed, announced that he sold two matrices of silk, cotton and cotton, covered with gold nets, for $70,000.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, a sales manager of A1 Moto, who has high-end cars with high-end alarms, said that his company had clearly sold Orange Porsche for $170 000 to the Russian billionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, who manages luxury cars to sell three nets into cars in the style of chain straps for Rolls-Royce Pantomy for $55,000.
He showed the reporter the car bike designed for the Russian casino owner, who had the escape drawn by the Swarovski crystal so it looked like a roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four of these.
"The Russian millionaire who wants a bullet-skin wheel or a portrait of his wife from a cross sawmill doesn't have to ride on those wheels yet," said Karapetian.
"He'll put them in his garage in 30 to 40 cars."
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" at present means nothing very exclusive, given the large increase in the prices of these properties.
"If you bought yourself three or four years ago in Moscow's apartment, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at the station of the Russian company Alliance Continental, which deals with asset management.
The company has raised four red British-style telephone booths to the value of millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing manager of the company, stated that his team had printed 500,000 counterfeit banknotes for the Millionaire Fair.
The collegiates stopped to spread around a bunch of money, or to let their friends take a picture of their mobile phone, as they rest in the middle of their spare wealth, or just cut out a few million.
"You know, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Death in New Jersey may be caused by an operation
It was the day before Thanksgiving, when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows at the restaurant about something better and followed the healing that came to a white New England house with two houses down the West Scott Avenue.
The car was soon connected to the police station.
And then another one.
"But I saw the delivery of a doctor," said Mr. Livingstone, a restaurant controller.
"At that moment, I knew someone was dead."
The authorities found out that a dead woman was Olga Arroy, 41 years old, executive assistant director of the NYPD department.
The investigators are now trying to determine whether she died because of a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity was refused by the police to provide the number 212 at the West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet found out what caused Miss Arroy's death, and they hope that the toxicological tests, whose results do not have to be known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death that was sent to the wave of grief by the authorities of the Newar police.
Ms. Arroy has been an assistant police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, cheerful and hard-working," said Mr. McCarthy about Miss Arroy in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She'd protect me."
Mr. McCarthy stated that Ms. Arroy was a wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Hungarian police officer who works for the Commission to control alcoholic beverages, and that she left two sons behind at the age of 14 and 11 and a daughter of her own.
Eileen Walsh, spokesperson for the Union, Theodore J. Romankova, said the detectives were trying to find out if Miss Arroy died of the consequences of unlicensed surgery.
"It's one of the options," said Miss Walsh.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
The authorities indicated that they arrived at the house about three o'clock in the afternoon 21st.
November and found Miss Arroy on the couch.
She was declared dead at the scene.
More than a week later, the authorities still said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, which is supposed to be Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh didn't say if the authorities heard from Miss Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine if a part of the house was used as an office officer.
On Wednesday in Miss Castro's house, with a ruined pink candle in the front garden and Dalmatian climbing in the back, no one answered.
Next to the door leading to the shop, a blue barrel with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillin" was found in the open garage, which is used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
On the sides of one side hung two mountain wheels.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in the New York City Police Department after 25 years, Miss Arroy gave him invaluable assistance in the investigation of his new city's unchristian and harsh political culture.
"She said, 'You should take care of this or this,' he said.
"She was always here when I came, and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hope that the Fed reduces interest rates, leads to the strengthening of world stock exchanges
The prices of the shares on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after the hopes of the market that the Federal Bank will try to calm the lending conditions by further reducing interest rates were reinforced by the soothing statements of the Vice-President of the US Central Bank.
The exchangers jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, the second in line with Ben Bernanke, President of the Federation, said that in response to continuing pressure on the financial markets, there must be "flexible and pragmatic" drivers.
In a clear effort to calm down the depressed markets in the midst of the signs of the revitalizing credit institutions, Mr. Kohn said that the recent increases "particularly resulted in some improvement in the functioning of the markets at the end of September and October".
He further stated that if the increased instability persists, the possibility that the financial conditions of households and companies will continue to worsen.
Investors consider these years as a signal that the Fed is ready to add additional fresh capital doses to the US market, and perhaps further reduction in interest rates to stabilise credit conditions.
These notes also helped to calm Wall Street in the midst of other bad news about the American economy when the sale of apartments in October showed record low numbers.
The results of the financial belief were supported by the announcement by Bear Stearns of the investment bank that it will abolish 650 jobs, which are 4% of its world labour force, in the context of reducing costs for compensating heavy losses caused by the unannounced commitment to the provision of sub-loans for housing in America.
It is expected that only 20 of these places will be destroyed in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the industrial index of Dow Jones grew by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, and ended at 13,289.40, while the more used S&P 500 increased by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165,5 percent, or 2.7 percent, and ended by 6,306.2, with the value of British blue chips increased by more than 39 billion pounds.
The German Dax index grew by 2.6 per cent and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 per cent.
Some time ago, market credit tensions were shown to be in full force after these funds were borrowed by the European commercial banks at a rate of 4,7 %, which is the largest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and to release excess money on the London money markets increased by the rate of three-month British interbank loans "Libor" dropped by 6.59 per cent after uninterrupted growth from 12 November to its maximum since the end of September.
England must decide: Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas here, one almost as hard as the other.
Who's going to be the number six on a finger for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context of nothing less relevant than the first Syrian Lance test, who is going to make this decision?
The second question is that David Graveney, the chairman of the electoral commission, who is holding the best in this position at the time, has Peter Moores, the chief coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, with the aid decision, and because the Hugh Morris table, the chief manager of the English team, is starting to apply to the national electorate's post, unless it is necessary for a full commitment.
Whoever's not built on the sixth place on the thumb will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport no longer.
It is not easy to find what one will get at the top of his profession, while one will never get over the lower level, sometimes due to a lack of luck rather than ability.
Not only in the cricket is the choice demanding and requires an assessment that must always be subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to move up?
It's fair to Shah, if not?
In the same way we could ask ourselves in other areas, let's say that here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Bannerjee, both smart young leading workers with good education and a review in the field, should be raised to the Commission - the place is only for one.
Who's supposed to say what level is right for the cricketer if he doesn't get a chance to drop or swim on the next one?
Of course, decision numbers have a great impact, but they have opportunities.
In the team, a cricketer must capture the captain's view at the right time, if he is to take a wicket, and the thumb needs a regular chance at starting positions, if ever he is to make a impression as a one-day cricketer.
Catching the sampler's view is more complicated.
For example, during the last season, James Anderson, whose place in the first test, seemed certain, was much better, even if Stephen Harmison had declared himself healthy and acted as a carpenter.
Anderson took 32 tickets in the first class at 33 crossings on each.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same mean, but both had their time at the highest level and hoped in the next.
If he's going to play at the Asgiriya Shah Stadium, or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can make a difference or a career, or it must also have no big impact.
Four years ago at Sri Lance Gareth Batty played in each test and in the first class gave good performances, five tickets and 40 permitted trips, but it was Paul Collingwood, who at the same time fought for his place, who eventually became a stable Test Cricketer, who was also, although in Australia against Australia, scored twice, perhaps still underestimated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moore, after another discussion on today's training purely at the Asirgy Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and give Shah's greater experience in the face of Bopar's youth.
There are arguments for both.
For Shaha, he speaks of his bold and valuable debut test shifts at 88 points in Bombay and 32 hundreds in the first grade opposite the six Boparovs, which is, in twenty-seven years old, seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin excess.
However, Shah made in two shifts in May against the Caribbean in Testu na Lord's, his home play in Middlesex, only ten passes, and that, along with the immediate rejection of the voters, when Vaughan wanted to re-assess him on another match, his firing seemed to wear something out of the ellain that was so evident in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex University has a joie de vibrare in its bones.
At the cricket playground, he has nothing to do with it and his behavior outside the playground symbolizes a recently turned car with a four-wheel drive on the exhibition day of the English car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He took off with his slight injuries and was shocked, but as the first thing he pulled out his Vodafone (also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his partner, who was watching it from a distance to ask him excitedly, "Have you seen it?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, its medium-speed smile uppers on the present games that seem to fit, give away effectively and fire with self-consciousness and skill.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe it's the real art of choice.
Personally, I'm inclined to get Bopara to get his chance now, which, of course, I don't want to say that Shah won't excel if, as the Cylon tea leaves indicate, he's the one who's gonna play next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and fight against al-Qaeda
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began to arrive in Baghdad yesterday and to pour out fugitives who came in money or exhausted the visa period, and others who hoped that the city would return to normal life.
Some even returned to fight the armed men who had expelled them from their homes.
The Mansour bus station was before 800 people arrived from Damascus in the official government convoy about a dozen buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan, who returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubajsi, a Sunni doctor.
"Today I came back for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, for what was done in Baghdad and how it's safe now.
"They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shishak militia of the militant spiritual Mukkady al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to stop fighting.
Kasim al-Athwani, an 80-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni Amariya region, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the darker regime did not allow the Iraqis to work.
His sly neighbors in Amariya called him by calling him that the local militia with the support of the American army helped to push Al-Qaeda out of her position in the west of the capital, and they urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of the Sunni and Shiite tribe, whose home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad was spared a grenade attack after he forced his fellow citizens to rise against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"Some friends called me on Monday and told me that they were going to Sleichh to the militia against al-Qaeda and that they needed me and the support of my boys.
That's why I came back today," said twenty-one-year-old Sabaah Alu Obedi.
Many spoke of the attractiveness of calming in the main city after the strengthening of the American military presence and the growth of the local "group of busy citizens" who arm themselves to the side of the American army defend their quarter.
But it was more about the fact that they have been forced to return to the obstacles around visas and money loss in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a father of three children, voiced his suspicions shared among refugees that Núri al-Maliki, a Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to restrict the visa of refugees and thus accepted them back.
According to the data available, more than two and a half million people fled from the Iraqi sectarian killers.
"It was all right before al-Maliki visited Syria and pressed the government to stop giving Iraqis visas to have to go back to Iraq," the Sunnitian pensioner said.
"I can't believe the government that supports the criminals who burned me home after I left."
Part of the reason for the weakening of violence is the fact that the suns were pushed out of the Shiite areas and on the contrary, which in many places reduces tension.
Concerns arise that sudden influx of refugees resuscitates sectarian tension and leads to another battle.
Little Sarsko, good education
The smallest country in Germany plays a leading role in vocational education, even excels the international focus of its high schools.
In only one educational area, Sarko is concerned with the same shortage as the rest of Germany.
"A man who does not come from Sarska, I explained yesterday at the age of fifty that we are no French" - this self-reironic password appears on the posters on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the birth of this smallest country.
France and Luxembourg, however, play a major role in the Sarah education system, which is in monitoring the education of the Colin Institute for Economic Research (IW) in the fifth place.
High schools have traditionally cooperated closely with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by France.
So far, students can finish the study with a double or even a triple degree.
A relatively high proportion of foreign students, accounting for 15.6 %, corresponds to this.
However, the average number of Sarah’s children is to be admitted to high school - many of them without high school studies.
"In Sarsk, a vocational education system is being used," says Axel Plünnecke, an IW educational expert.
The fact that more than five young people are entitled to study at the university is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared with the rest of Germany, there are rich opportunities in Sarska to combine practical and academic education.
The opportunities to study two sectors are the second best in Germany, given the number of inhabitants.
Despite practically oriented education and rising demand, the number of engineering graduates fell by one third in recent years.
That is why the Serbian Ministry of Education has now ordered high schools to create a promotion campaign in the engineering fields.
"After the first study of Pisa, we conducted several reforms in general education schools," says the Ministry of Education spokesperson.
That's why the government has conducted comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to begin to learn as soon as possible, the last year of the mother’s school is free - a model that takes over from other countries.
If the results of the students are significantly improved, they will show up to the next comparative study.
In the course of the Pisa study in 2003, the proportion of pupils at risk decreased from 29 % to 20 %.
In general, however, Sarsko has not improved as much as other countries have.
The Bavarians can count better.
And to the disappointment of Sarska study Pisa does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages - in the other case, Sarsko could just point in this area.
The language of the neighbours is compulsory in the gymnasiums - although the inhabitants of Sarska are not French.
Chavez moves hours
What they won't see will be hours in Venezuela other than the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will move hours in this South American country half an hour back.
In Spain, in the meantime, Chavez becomes a funny figure.
The Venezuelan official newspaper reported that hours would be shifted by less than four and a half hours, according to the new law against world time.
The South American state will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Chavez, the enemy of the United States, has also justified his decision, inter alia, by the fact that the United States has forced the world to divide the time zones throughout the hour.
In the middle of the local time, Chávez also announced that due to the case of handcuffs, relations with neighboring Colombia would be interrupted.
This left-wing nationalist has declared that while conservative Alvaro Uribe President Colombia will not have any relations with him or with the Colombian government.
"For my own sake, I can't," said Chávez, who advocates the reform of the constitution, which citizens of this oil country must vote on in Sunday's referendum.
With this reform, Chávez would greatly strengthen his power in the country.
The Hädke has called upon Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate to negotiate in Colombia with Marxist rebels about the release of hostages.
Uribe, in his decision, Venezuela "swift into the face", criticised Uribe Chavez on Sunday.
In Spain, too, everyone is talking about Chavez.
The new mobile call here caused a stir: "Why don't you call?" (Why don't you shut up?) - it sounds like a phrase that has already gotten more than half a million people out of the Internet.
The Spanish King Juan Carlos spoke of it, whom, at the recent Ibero-American summit, the vocal notes of this left-wing populist were so disillusioned that he was silenced in this way.
Germans are threatened with lower payments in 2007
According to the forecast, this year German employees are threatened with a reduction in real wages even in the face of a strong economic downturn.
Experts have reasoned on their pessimistic forecast for a number of reasons.
According to Hans Böckler's 2007 estimates, employees can actually count on getting lower wages than last year.
"The wine is accompanied by a small increase in salaries, an increase in the value added tax and an increase in food and energy prices," said Bild Gustav Horn of the Institute of Research, IMK (Institut für Macrookonomie und Konjunkturforschung).
New pressures on employees may also be expected in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the new year's planned reduction of unemployment contributions to 3.3% is correct and reasonable in this situation.
However, the labour force should not again fall into such difficulties as to require loans or contributions from young people, quoted the newspaper of this socially democratic policy.
On Tuesday it was announced that the price explosion of food and oil products has avoided inflation in its highest state in the last 13 years.
In the annual price comparison, the total price stood by three percent.
Venus is a hell of a double Earth.
Throughout his life, the enemy atmosphere of Venus Earth is more similar than it has ever been imagined. The European space probe Venus Express on Venus recorded phenomena that occur also in the winter on Earth: lightning in the atmosphere and wind belief in the fields.
For almost three decades, scientists have known that Venus is coming to light.
Now the European Venus Express probe brought evidence - captures electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. At Venus, the stars fly from darkness to darkness, about 56 kilometers high, written in the scientific magazine Nature Christopher Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles.
According to a well-known theory, the original mass could be produced on Earth by the lightnings. The storms reportedly originated in the oceans reactions that led to the formation of amino acids, the basic stones of life.
There was no such thing on Venus: "If life ever existed there, it must have been a long time ago," explains Sean Solomon of Carnegie Institute in Washington.
The atmosphere is about 100 times thicker than on Earth, and sometimes temperatures are around 500 °C.
"Venus is perhaps the hell twins of the Earth, but it's the twin," said Russell.
Why did Venus, which is such a mass and size of the Earth, begin to develop completely differently, is the basic issue of Esa's mission.
Since the beginning of the 1990s no probe was sent exclusively for the purpose of Venus study, the launch of the Venus Express probe in November 2005 was in the research of this planet as a milestone.
According to scientists, the latest results of research, which approached several articles in Nature magazine, did not only highlight the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighboring planet is more like the Earth than it has been predicted so far," Esa said.
In addition to the already known winds of the North Pole, scientists have found a dark belief in the South Pole, which is much faster.
This phenomenon recalls air flows to the northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Astrophysics Spacial and Physics Cosmica.
The second inner planet of our solar system forms almost the same mass as the Earth and the average of 12 100 km is almost as large.
This planet, marked as the Jitřenka or the Evening Meal, will run the sun for 225 days.
One day on Venus takes 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus does not remember the surface temperature of 460 °C and the pressure of 92 bars on Earth, scientists believe that both planets are created under very similar conditions.
The water was gathered on both sides, but on the earth it remained in the oceans, while the Venus came into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonates on Earth, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalajlama
Spolko President Köhler calls for the end of the party's dispute over the adoption of the branch office.
He indirectly criticised the SPD for her attacks on the office after a meeting in September.
Spolko President Horst Köhler is concerned about the reputation of Germany and calls for a great coalition to end the struggle around the adoption of the Dalailams.
"We should not, moreover, present ourselves as a nation that is not united on this issue," Köhler told the commercial newspaper Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding of the decision of the German office of Angely Merkel (CDU) to accept the Dalailam in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have universal validity for me," Köhler said.
The President-in-Office stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, but it did not prevent Merkel from stopping when it was calculated that he was creating a new policy towards China.
"The collective office has not left China's traditional policy.
China also knows," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) made a direct statement of his disagreement with the acceptance of the Dalai Lama, and was attacked by a number of coalitions.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the "preparation" foreign policy of the coalition.
After the adoption, German-Chinese relations deteriorated in the office.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the call by the German Finance Minister Peera Steinbrück (SPD), but the information provided by SPIEGEL also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministries abroad.
The Chinese President of the Wen Jiabao Government called on Angel Merkel's office to admit that the adoption of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept the Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China's position.
Words and deeds have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas, which are also located in the territory of China, tries to separate from China.
Schäuble warns against similar troubles that broke out in France
Street battles with police, gunshots, fuelled cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns against similar disturbances that broke out in France.
We must do everything we can to ensure that social unrest in Germany does not increase in violence on the street, the social minister calls for it inside.
The barricades burned, the miners shot at the police. After serious youth troubles in France, the social minister, Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is also concerned with similar developments in Germany.
"We must pay attention to the fact that there are also social tensions that will erupt in violence.
We have to take it seriously," the newspaper Neue Press said.
Not every young person is able to cope with a rapid change in social reality.
The local government, the country and the municipalities are already working hard to remove the problems, Schäuble said.
Which means not just integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit after the conference on Islam, we record our first successes."
However, caution is still in place.
Schäuble has at the same time pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of German suburbs are not comparable to those of French.
In the last few nights, youth and police in the northern suburbs of Paris fought hard street fights.
Even in Toulouse, she burned cars and public buildings.
The president of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat, called for greater integration efforts by the German government.
In view of the problems in France, Kolat warned against the "supply effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as exciting as in France.
However, it should be done.
Kolat pointed out that among people under the age of 25 who come from migrant families, the unemployment rate is "averagely high".
Above all, it is necessary to ensure a greater number of study opportunities.
Kolat stressed, "We have to give young people hope."
The President of the Turkish municipality added that, unlike France, there is more social control of families in Germany.
In addition, many young people from migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat called out, "But we have to be careful."
We have to let young people "be able to start working and be educated quickly."
Meanwhile, the night at the Paris suburb of Williers-le-Bel remained very calm.
There were hundreds of police officers and a helicopter flew over the area with a flashlight.
The authorities have reported three arrests and several burned waste and cars.
Since yesterday, there have been about 1,000 armed forces.
The police will be involved as long as it is necessary, announced after a visit by the Ministry of Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie.
In trouble at the Villiers-le-Bel suburb, about 80 policemen were injured on Tuesday night.
The following night, Toulouse's troubles took over.
An accident caused a Sunday traffic accident, during which two young people died.
According to the initial findings of the state representation, there is no guilt for the police at the death of young people.
In Angely's "The Clouds"
The office's truly remote output shows that the coalition is programmed at the end and that we can't expect anything more from it.
What country does this office actually live in?
After her discontent, insatiable and indiscriminately poor speech on the General debate of the Spolko dream, we must find that there is not here - not in this country, which she should finally manage.
According to Angela Merkel’s argument that she is too focused on foreign policy, she replied with a very arrogant sentence.
It's provincial, she said, which shows she doesn't want to understand what the critics are talking about.
In Spolko's dream, she clearly showed how much she deserves this lesson.
Merkel did not feel genuine interest, but he felt for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela presented herself as "Oblaková": a politician who excels over others who pushes into foreign policy and even speaks only in a loud voice.
For example, climate protection: they always praise the conclusions of the Heiligendam Summit, but they no longer say how the climate goals are to be achieved in Germany.
And yet, such self-reproach - so much modesty would be forgiven by the president of the CDU two years ago.
It is now limited to the planned phrases that could increase the pattern between people.
This approach damages its image of pragmatics, which does not need to be fooled by problems.
But in Angely's "Oblakova" realm, internal political problems are the district issues.
Children's poverty and concern for people with low wages?
A few other points on these topics have been left to her.
It is worth noting how often Merkel's, when it comes to children's additions, is being over-reached.
Three times Merkel has to start from the beginning in order for her to be able to express at least partially the correct sentence.
As soon as things start to become very specific, it's like a completely foreign field.
Department of Attacks
The debate of the Republican presidential candidates on Youtube in the case of the favorites of Rudy Giulianicho and Mitt Romney has been launched in a lively debate - and both now have to worry about the external candidate.
The tension of both candidates is already on the first topic.
Mitt Romney predicts to his opponent Rudy Guilianim that he has made a "refugee for illegal immigrants" from New York.
Giuliani reacts quickly with harsh remarks: "I think his own house was just one such shelter," answers and predicts to former governor Massachusetts that he has employed immigrants in private without evidence.
Since the Republican Foundation has no clear preference so far, eight presidential candidates are using these debates on the CNN mainly to discredit their competitors.
Half-minute, internet users filmed and via YouTube sent video only serves as a key theme tip.
"This is exactly the policy of isolationism that we have enabled Hitler to grasp power," John McCain advocates his rival Ron Paul, who as the only one promotes the immediate downfall of the armies from Iraq.
The Vietnamese vet McCain doesn't check with either Romney or Romney for refusing to condemn the torture method of questioning called Waterboarding, where heating is simulated.
The response of the public in Florida, St. Petersburg, shows that there is no war in Iraq or torture.
The commitment shall be expressed in a manner that is consistent whenever conservative values are adopted and the future increase of the data is prohibited.
Then it shows where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," explains Romney's violation and asks for a page-based and television audience to forgive him for being still a prisoner of execution in 1994.
Giuliani is in despair when he is to express himself on a literal Bible translation.
The First Ruler of Civilian Government
On the day after his resignation from the position of chief commander of the army, the Pakistani ruler Musharaf made a presidential oath.
This will end eight years of military government in Pakistan.
On Thursday, the President of Pakistan, Parvíz Musharaf, made a presidential oath, and will remain in the presidential office for another five years.
Pakistan's television broadcasts a live ceremony that was held in the presidential palace in the capital of Islamabad.
The Musharaf swore he would respect the constitution and strive for a good nation.
On Wednesday, his office of chief commander of the army handed over to his officer Ashfang Kiyani, who was subjected to international pressure, especially by the United States.
Eight years after he gained power in the bloodless military coup, the government's former general was the first civilian head of the state.
By resigning from the position of chief commander of the armed forces, Musharraf met one of the main requirements of opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the abolition of the exceptional status declared by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to High State Representative Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will abolish the exceptional status soon after his oath, and will thus meet the further requirements of the West.
The highest court in the country that Musharraf, after declaring an exceptional position at the beginning of November, had held him in favour of the lawmakers, rejected all objections last week concerning the contested re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed and four others were injured during the attack on the military convoy in the northern Vaziristan tribe.
The silent army reported that the bomb exploded on the road near the Afghanistan border.
Father's Krautrock returns
The famous German group of the 1970s is playing again. Three Harmonia members re-enacted their electronic synthesizers at the Berlin concert.
Revival will include Live 1974, the sister of the most successful band.
They've been a lot better known abroad than ever.
The announced sensation then lies in the performance of three seated gentlemen who at first look like they're just enjoying dinner.
Everyone's got a box, cables, and especially buttons.
Thirty-year-old Dieter Moebius in a snow-white shirt sitting in the middle.
After his left, he's seven-year-old Michael Rother, who's got a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
Thirty-seven-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who concentrates on the synthesizers, is from the right perspective of the viewers.
Everyone makes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Some of them, of course, will create a traditional composition.
It doesn't seem to be too much for the musicians.
Among the lovers of the Krautrock, the Revival of the Chapels of Harmony caused a great stir.
One thing here is worth noting. Repeated questions have shown that this name is part of a collective awareness of the pope, but it is certainly not so late that this band will lose some twenty-three years of pain.
But why could not even Germany celebrate its still living legends from the 1970s?
And especially when you're a musical style, a misnomer called karutrock, in England and America, you value more than in your own country.
When in 2003 the music business gave the remaining members of the Can Colin Group the Echo price for the work of life, the hall was full of searching views of German pop fans.
In addition, when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu for their speech, the audience was no longer aware of the boundaries.
Michael Rother later at the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts with them sat on the scene as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and worshiping abroad is one thing.
Remembering the band of Harmony we overburdened the memory, this trio existed for only two years, and even at that time it did not have the influence that others later added to it.
Moebius and Roedelius used to play with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promised name Cluster.
At first, they were playing in the Berlin Schaubühne theatre store.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, at the Gramophone company led by the church.
Rother recently helped the Kraftwerk group, but the reputation was gained as a guitarist at the Neu band!, which at the time was perhaps the most radical German group.
In 1973, Rother followed the musicians of the Cluster chapel to exile in Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the 16th century ruins of Old Weserhof, lived as members of the municipalities that fled the city.
They didn't live here as ideologically as in Commune I, where Roedelius could still climb like a sheep.
It was more of a life in such a spitzweg art apartment.
The name of the artist concerned shall be taken from the name of the singer Harmonia Ottenstein, whose label was allegedly found in the ashtray.
Many of this harmony has been preserved.
The first album was called "Hudba of Harmony" and the following "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered financial difficulties.
The collection of herbs did not serve only self-recognition.
Now the "Live 1974" CD was cut off at the Griesse concert in front of a record-playing little, barely 50-year-old.
Rothera expressed her desire to be a member of the harmony and, on occasion, to practice.
For Roedlia and Moebia, it was a completely wrong requirement.
In 1975 the band announced its breakup.
Rother ended up in an esoteric field and assured himself of his future with the album "Burning Heart."
The Cluster chapel has lived again in the 1980s, and since then it has been more successful than Harmony has ever been.
We can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer for his live album.
His recording company Grönland took the goal of monitoring the Krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
The Neu chapel was then considered the solo work of Rodelius.
The bodily resurrection of Harmony will take place in the Berlin House of World Culture.
The performance at the Woldtronics Festival will be publicly sponsored.
It will be available to Brit, Julian Cope, an old pancake and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte, is also involved.
That's what we planned for the overall width of the impact of the Krautrock on the future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group will just fill in Harmony.
Brian Ena's poem accompanied by the most amazing sounds is played in the hall: "Only true music, it belongs to the future."
There are images on which the producer with Harmony is at the farm.
The creation of a legend also contributes to the creation of other black and white photographs on which are now equipped with wild cables.
Before that, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
I don't want to stick my microphones to the drums and drums anymore, so that the tools can blow out the unheard of self-produced tones.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three to the puncture technique.
It doesn't change anything. It doesn't change the House of World Culture.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, the sound clouds are squeezed and in one beautiful place they emphatically sing "Aaaaaaaa!"
Krautrock was always very English.
It's never been rock.
We would find roots more than in the blues at high schools (Can), in the Kraftwerk or in the run-off before the arts and social conventions (Cluster).
The one who in this place shouts "'68!" is not so far from the truth, but harmony won't even be allowed out of peace now.
Even the most obvious of all, on the stage, is a thorough thought.
Where does the music start and when does it end?
This question will be prepared for the nerves, or it will be better for him to experience the touching moments of happiness.
Richard Gere just isn't pretty cynical.
With the introduction of the films The Hunting Party and Mörderscher Frieden, there were just two films about the war in the Balkans.
But not one of them is convinced.
The presentation of the films either puts too much emphasis on accuracy and shooting, or they're too emotional.
Not even an actor like Richard Gere will stop at The Hunting Party.
Good news as a first: War criminals Karadj and Mladić are still hiding in the Balkans mountains, but right there, in the cloudy background of the Bosnian War, the actor Richard Gere October.
In recent times, we have lost sight of the most beautiful man of the 1980s, not only because he played in many popular, minor roles in fairy movies, but in connection with his press conferences forever on the subject of Buddhism, a person will enjoy another movie with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party - Where the hunter becomes useful (Why must the names of the films be so long and confused today?).
Gere is performing a magical performance. His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically who Gere could have happened if fate and film industries weren't so merciful: a man who has his best years long ago, but as a anxious like a memory still retains a certain remarkable perspective.
But even through this drum, The Hunting Party is with the German film Mörderscher Frieden, which also enters the movies this week, just by continuing an endless series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
With the film Mördescher Frieden we can make a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save the Serbian girl from the Kosovo shooter, one of whom is in love.
Although it is commendable that the Serbs are not represented here as the cause of all evil, this television movie is changing too soon in the shooting and action.
There's going to be something much like the Kobru 11 series, without the road, but for that with the war.
In the film The Hunting Party we can examine in detail why the Balkan War has not yet been able to make a really good film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who appear as a "person", the Serbian top war criminal, could become a new "Apocalypse" at another time and under the leadership of another director and scriptwriter (here is both Richard Shepard).
The two stories seem strange: little groups go to the woods to do something that the army is unable to do, but their path becomes a path to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the brilliant and sentimental cynic represented at the outset.
On the contrary, the proposal also presupposes a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim.
The Hunting Party's film can finally be released after the reporters have been led in the last five minutes by what NATO, CIA and all the world's criminals have not said in the last five years: capture the criminals and leave him fair revenge on the Bosnian Muslims.
This is so against the logic of filmmaking that it would be worth turning to the International Court of the Hague.
Then this film has a deep human message.
It considers that Karadz and Mladic are still at large, and suspects the Americans and the French (here they are extremely united) that under secret political agreements they do not deserve to be pursued quite intensively.
But good and evil are sometimes like that, a woman will attack us with Brecht's famous poem.
It's about an Asian demon's wooden mask on the writer's desk: "I'm concerned about the lives of the dead on the forehead, noticing how hard it is to be evil."
In films like The Hunting Party, they come out exactly like the naked heads, but they indicate how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the subject of war in the Balkans.
Recently it was reported in these newspapers that all Hollywood films about Iraq were very unsuccessful.
The only thing to add to this is that no good film on South Africa has ever been filmed.
It's almost always valid: If the star lands after the crisis area or passes through the mine fields, a movie like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, Angelin Jolie's breaking edge or Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCapire will be produced.
Maybe all those conflicts are just too close to time.
Finally, they had to spend decades before Hollywood could film a good movie about the Holocaust - Schindler's list.
Many films must probably arrive - films that are considered to be classical Vietnamese works - "Lovec deer", "Apocalypsa" or "Colded Vest" - were then in no way celebrated as masterpiece works.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder at home appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
The writers then do not have the ability that is needed to make the most of good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "Great dictator" have become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin have not yet known how in a terrible way the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe a man shouldn't want to be good when he wants to make good movies.
Maybe he has to create a sarcastically balanced artistic view as the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When questioned on the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprier's Dictionary" and "Balkan War", he said, "The only way that some things never change is.
Cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be killed in a terrible way, and war in Yugoslavia will always be."
Von Beust blames for rejecting the Olympics
The departure of the mayor from the summer Olympics in Hamburg has been a direct criticism of politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the water game.
Von Beust, however, invites realism in the estimation of a chance.
On Wednesday, the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, marked this decision "for business as unfortunate".
No other project has recently woken up in the city as much motivation as an Olympic thought.
"Without this objective, it would not be possible to maintain this sporting political enthusiasm to such a high degree."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury this project, but created a new long-term concept for it, "which comes from a changed time plan."
The mayor of Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday in his earlier statements, which say the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg are unrealistic by 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Association will decide on the Olympic candidacy," said von Beust to the newspaper WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December, the Sports Association will decide on the application of Mnichova to winter games in 2018.
"This preference for us means that we have no realistic chance with a time plan dating back to 2028."
Still, this dream hasn't ended, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Union (HSB) marked von Beustov's years as policing.
It's a feeling that Hamburg doesn't want to get away with organizing the Olympics in the next twenty-five years.
"It's too soon to destroy your chances by marking plans at this early stage as buried," said HSB President Günter Ploss on Wednesday.
The detention would be contrary to the statement made by the senate chief, who referred to the general German High School Sports Association as a valid assembly.
Von Beust did not announce the award for the Olympics in 2015.
The Hamburg High School Sports Association only nominated the candidate city last week.
The SPD Group in the Hamburg parliament of the Senate found it to be a valuable time that could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
"The development of Klein Grassbrook's area was suspended for the Senate for years, because he had set up the event and excluded the building of apartments," said SPD members Carol Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Klein Grassbrook area was still planning the Olympics with the fact that the entire area will be later used for residential purposes, the CDU unanimously put on the "Olympian factor".
The ban on the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great excitement in Hamburg.
But Hamburk was wasted in Lipsk.
They're not Warhol's boxes.
The person who connects the expressions of Sweden and the woodwork is not thinking of Andy Warhol, but of Ike.
Or is it?
Wooden bricks produced at the time in Sweden are cast on the Warhol's work of dark shadows.
Most of it on the list of the ninety-four "Brillo Boxes" of Stockholm are falsifications.
After several months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" expressed doubts about the integrity of the Warhols "Brillo Boxes" in 1968, the internal research of the Modern Museum in Stockholm comes with a result that brought disappointment; six "Brillo Boxes", which in 1995 dedicated to the gift of its former director Pontus Hultén, are copies - like most of the other "Brillo Boxes" of Stockholm, which are on the international art market in circulation.
The previous events are a wrapped, maturing chain of artistic and curatorial actions.
Warhol produced his first Brillo box in New York in 1964, painted wooden paintings that were based on the red-brown design paper box of Brillo powder.
The exhibition of his work at the Modern Museum in 1968 - with Warhol's consent - was produced by hundreds of Brillo beyniks from the carton. They did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from Brillo factory.
It wasn't about art, but about their suggestions, just the exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 to make several wooden Brillo bedens in Sweden, but you are not exposed in Modern Museum.
The Witnesses now speak of fifteen poor people who have been legally admitted to art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warholovy Brillo Boxy" with the label Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for over $100,000.
The problem now lies in the fact that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum later falsely claimed that in 1968 it was made in Sweden and exposed about a hundred misery that Warhol then left him.
In fact, 105 Hultén’s bees were produced in Malmö for the exhibition in Petrohrad only in 1990.
Warhol was three years after he died at the time.
Lars Byström, the top conservator of Moderna Museet, examined in addition to six Brillo boxes that are in the property of the museum, also three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their roundboards were painted in the basic color and painted, were made by the confectioner in the oil white color.
On the contrary, from the 1990 copy structure, it appeared that the paint was made of a painting role directly on the rollboard - in addition to acrylic and not oil color.
"These woes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official Brill Boxes," said the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If Andy Warhol Art Approval Board in New York does not come to any other conclusion, Moderna Museet will have to be classified as "exhibited material - copy."
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced that these "accused charges" that were filed in the case of a powder case would be dealt with.
The organization, however, is still in constant silence.
Rebellious Soldiers in Manila Give Up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had settled in a hotel in Manila demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The leader of the rebels Antonio Trillanes, who expelled the president of manipulation and corruption at the elections, told the hotel reporters that he refused responsibility for the bloodshed.
The government's surrender soldiers have already attacked the hotel with a drop of gas.
A few hours ago, about two dozen soldiers were locked up in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them stood before the court due to an attempt to overthrow in 2003, including Trillanes.
The action used to run away with about 30 sympathians.
The military policemen who were supposed to watch him clearly crossed his side and joined the rebellion.
They entered the hotel in Pennsylvania and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The government of the loyal units of the area around the selected hotel closed.
The President permitted an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have enough," said Triallnes.
"We invite people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, the commander of the former elite squad Scout Rangers, said that other military units will join in the march shortly.
The government's critics called for a large demonstration against the President on Friday.
For months, her government has been counting corruption.
The Manila financial area has already become the main cause of the rebellion against Arroy in 2003.
Because the rebels refused to join the army, the riot broke out after a few 24 hours.
Since 1986, at least seven attempts have been made to overthrow the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
