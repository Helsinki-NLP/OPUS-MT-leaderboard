In China and in the area, two men died by suicide
One of the hangings has already attempted suicide.
On 30 October, about 1-00, in the village of Lugowa, the man of birth committed suicide by hanging in 1947.
It's known that he's been trying suicide before.
What led a man to such a move is not known.
On 31 October, in 11-50, he died after he had been hanged by a 41-year-old man living in Kineshma.
No signs of violent death were found, reported the Chinese IMO press service.
You got a black box in your car?
While U.S. road designers are trying to find money to repair the exhaust system, many start to see the solution in a small black box right on your car's gearbox.
These devices, which track each passenger car miles and transmit this information to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt to modernize the old American highway financing system undertaken by Washington and the state planning authorities.
Usually a boring highway planning arena has resulted in intense debates and colorful alliances.
The Liberians joined environmental groups in lobbying the Government to grant the right to use small boxes to track the number of miles you travel and perhaps even where you travel, and then use this information when making tax accounts.
A chaplain's move in shock.
The American Union of Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and raises a number of issues concerning private life.
Although the congress cannot yet agree, continue or not, a few states are not going to wait.
They are thinking about how they can move to a system where drivers pay for every mile of the road they travel.
Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is really necessary for our country.
“This is not the question on which we may have the right to choose,” said Hassan Ihrat, Executive Director of the Southern California Government Association, which prepares plans to start monitoring the authorities of the state of Mile by each California driver by 2025.
There will be a change in how we pay these taxes.
There's technology for that.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government's Road Construction Fund, which is financed by taxes paid by the Americans on autos.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
The cars are going over a mile per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not want to increase the tax by even one cent at high prices for petrol.
"The fuel tax is simply impossible to keep," said Li Mannic, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
It has recently installed 500 tracking devices to test the fault payment system.
“This will be the best alternative in the long term,” he said.
It's called the wrong payout.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, as tax can change the nature of travel to reduce road load and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
The California Planners are looking at the system in developing strategies to achieve the targets set by the ambitious laws of this state to combat global warming.
However, a member of the Chamber of Representatives Bill Schuster (Republicer, Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Chamber of Transport Committee, said that he also considered the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
The Free Market Commitments in the Reasons Fund are also alarmed by the fact that drivers will pay for every mile.
“It is not just a tax that will go into the black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Political Affairs Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
This movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in 2011 called for congresses to move towards the wrong payment.
The United States Senate approved a pilot project worth $90 million last year, involving some 10,000 cars.
However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected this proposal because of the fears of rural legislators representing voters who often have to travel a lot of miles in everyday life to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities, however, go on their own.
The biggest enthusiasm is seen in Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are attracted to participate in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state for a mile away instead of a gas tax.
The pilot project has already been completed in Nevada.
It is being considered in New York.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport departments of 17 Eastern Coast states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), explores how they can make these changes.
This concept has not received universal recognition.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers had recently been equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the Government could track each of their steps.
“The concern about the “great brother” and such things is a major problem,” said Alaudin Khan, who is responsible for strategy and efficiency management in the state transport department of Nevada.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the tests went full, the United States Office of Civil Liberties in Nevada warned on its website: “It will be quite easy to turn these devices into full-scale tracking devices”.
There is no need to create a huge, huge technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where poor technology is difficult to find, which would allow the state authorities to take advantage of the traffic by car miles, but without information about the location and time.
If you can do that, Han said, society will feel more at ease.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
The company did not initially contribute to the collection of state taxes.
She was trying to get into the developing market of the type of car insurance in which drivers paid on the basis of the run.
But the devices it tests attract road designers because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information periodically charged with modem.
“People will be more inclined to do so if you do not track their speed and position,” said Ryan Morrison, Executive Director True Mileage.
There were several major errors in some of these state pilot programmes.
There are far less expensive and less demanding ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers experiment with the provision of different options to drivers.
They can choose the device with or without GPS.
Or they can completely turn off the device by deciding instead to pay a fixed collection based on the average number of miles that all the residents of the state travel.
In other places, they hope to sell the idea of a cautious public, forcing the devices to do more, not less.
In New York, transport officials are trying to develop a taxing device that will also be charged on parking counters, provide “payments as you travel” insurance and collect a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid samples.
“Automobiles will be attracted to the benefits offered to them,” says the urban design paper.
Some transport system designers, however, wonder if not all of the wrong payment talks are simply a huge factor.
In the city transport commission on the San Francisco Bay, officials say that the congress could easily overcome the bankruptcy of the Trust Fund for the Construction of Roads by raising taxes on petrol.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be taken from drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of petrol to pay their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgical intervention, when all you have to do is take aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the Legislative and Public Relations Commission.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their private lives and many other things.
EU prepares Ukraine's support for Russia's economic pressure
The European Union has a contingency plan for providing gas to Ukraine, as well as for reaching an agreement with IMF on the external credit if Russia takes any action in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius Summit.
The IMF is negotiating standby loans, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their goal was to conclude an agreement in the near future.
In addition to the potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts questioned by Reuters are suspected that Ukraine and IMF are able to overcome the long-standing differences in the financing conditions.
He does not believe in the possibility of reforming the aid required, and the international S&P rating agency, which reduced Ukraine's sovereign rating on Friday to one level, to "B" with "B".
However, EU representatives say that IMF can show flexibility in terms of credit, taking into account Ukraine's circumstances.
In addition to the EU's financial support plan, the country has a spare option for providing Ukraine with gas, which is a major part of the supplies from Russia.
Maybe it's going to be a gas from the North Stream or a reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way in the event that Russia “is insulating” Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reverse deliveries to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks and will probably lead to lower deliveries to other regions.
"The EU-Ukraine countries are negotiating how to create favourable conditions for Ukraine to import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes," added the Reuters source.
Russia outside the fight against urban pollution by cars
Attempts to address the transport problems of major cities have been seen in most megapolises of the world since the second half of the 20th century.
Usually, it was either about rehabilitating and expanding the motorways, or attempting to reduce the demand for car travel, the number of cars and the time they were used.
Singapore is a widely known example of a sharp quota for the growth of private cars and the right to purchase them is purchased in auctions.
His price may be twice as high as the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced a fee for entering the city centre.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, the so-called green zone is introduced, where only a car with a certain ecoclass is allowed, which also uses high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric cars).
In 2012, for example, the Beijing Environment Agency approved a five-year clean air plan of approximately 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
As told by the Director of the Transport Pollution Control Division of the Municipal Environment Bureau of Beijing Li Kunseng, the main goal of the five-year period is to reduce leading air pollutants by 20 to 35 per cent by 2017, increase in the number of private cars up to a level of 6 million (now 5.2 million) and increase in fuel consumption by up to 5 per cent per vehicle.
According to the agency, traffic in Beijing is now responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the programme is the limitation of the use of car transport and the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
In addition, urban “green five-year measures” include accelerated transition to Euro-fuel standards, the introduction of a local eco-standard system and the marking of cars and fuels, the restriction on the entry of cars into the central part of the city, the prohibition on the use of obsolete vehicles (including the establishment of incentive financial programmes for the replacement of old cars into hybrids or electric cars), the development of electric transport (including public and public services), the development of public transport (including high-speed).
Beijing's car innovations also include a ban for all private cars to move within the fifth transport ring (all six of them in the CND capital) one day a week (the corresponding information is given in the vehicle number) as well as the issue of registration marks for cars based on the lottery (e.g. in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of registration permits for private cars in Beijing was only one third of the number of 2010).
According to the current 2012-2020 Environment Programme, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 it was 138).
According to the Ministry, in 2011, 41 per cent of all emissions of pollutants in the urban atmosphere were on "movable sources".
In Moscow, for example, vehicle emissions are ten times higher than industrial emissions, and in St. Petersburg, nine times higher.
In the RF, there is only a beginning to think about the possibility of limiting car regulation on the streets of cities.
The Director of the Institute of Transport and Transport Policy of the U.S.A. Michael Blinkin believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at overcoming the demand for car travel are, of course, unpopular, only to be taken by society, provided that they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem related to the structure of its car park, where there are two clusters of less responsive to any regulatory effects - both official and personal cars, as well as "privileged" cars, with a total number of not less than 200 thousand (about 5% of the total number of Moscow cars).
During the days of the ECOM city centre in St. Petersburg, a study was prepared to analyze the balance of urban areas between the residential structure, the road surface and the number of transports.
The main findings of the researchers: the city centre provides roads twice as much as required, and most of the motorists living in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them on the parks for a long time or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed not to build parks but car storage facilities, not to expand, but to reduce the road (to make the streets more friendly for pedestrians) and to limit the use and location of personal transport within the area of the historic zone (a total area of approximately 3212 ha covering a number of central areas of the city).
The penalties for unauthorized street trade in Vodde will increase once
In the opinion of the city authorities, an increase in fines would help to bring order to Volod and free the streets from natural tents and shackles.
Most street traders do not pay taxes, the products they produce often do not pass the corresponding sanitary controls.
And that means that the health of the wetlands is threatened.
Thus, the lower fine for citizens for unauthorized trade from November will be six times, from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, reports the Voloda Administration Press Service.
Goldman Sachs warned of risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of the growing risks to Russia's main driver of fragile economic growth - consumption.
This is primarily a non-payment crisis for unsecured consumer loans and mass reductions for workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed down, but rather that it is the structure of growth.
He has recently been completely responsible for consumption, which is almost free of traffic," said the chief economist Goldman Sachs on Russia Clemens Grafe, presenting a quarterly report on the Russian economy yesterday.
Now the nominal wage growth in Russia is about 10%.
If inflation is 6 per cent, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at about the current level, waiting for Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so it is likely that they will optimize staff costs.
Today we see a significant increase in wages in GDP: if wages grow by 10%, GDP is only by 2%, Mr. Grafe explained.
The companies faced a reduction in profitability.
If it does not grow, it can lead to unemployment and unemployment.
The Russian business cannot raise salaries, commented the chief economist Barclays Capital on Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantushiin.
Unemployment close to historical minimums, competition for high workers.
In order to change or retain current staff, employers have to raise salaries.
Russia's demand for support is also fueled by a very rapid growth in demand.
Mr. Grafe said that, owing to the extremely high consumer interest rates, the country ' s economy had not been affected by this type of credit.
"The benefits for the economy from growth in need of credit have not been seen, money is not spent on the economy, but are returned to the same banks as interest payments," the economist said.
But the problem in another is that Goldman Sachs is expecting a rise in the delay in unsecured loans.
They are taken mainly by the poor people to provide for them.
Interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they are not returned more often," said Mr. Grafe.
The second threat to growth in Russia is therefore a possible non-payment crisis for unsecured loans.
The Director of the Banking Institute of the U.S.E., Vasilia Solodkov, is now seeing signs of the emerging banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to the cheap resources available to the hosbanks, were forced to attract high-percentage funds.
In response, the gosbanks went to the war and reduced their credit rates, and the economist continued.
Small credit organizations cannot issue loans under the same percentages, otherwise they will have a negative margin of interest.
If the banks do not give up, Russia is in danger of a full-fledged bank crisis, according to Vasili Solodkov.
The exclusion of a number of banks in recent weeks of economists is considered to be a sign of mass collapse.
“The banks themselves will not cope with this situation: the investment insurance system has not initially been addressed to the systemic crisis,” warns the head of the institution.
However, consumption growth will slow down even without a non-payment crisis, and the investment is based on the failure to index salaries of employees and military personnel in the current version of the draft budget.
Part of the impact on consumption will be mitigated by the freezing of natural monopolies tariffs (and, as a consequence, by lowering inflation).
But only in part: if investments do not grow (and the prerequisite for this is not yet available), the growth in consumption will still be slow, confident in Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantushiin of Barclays Capital has not yet seen a prerequisite for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still a drop in oil prices," he says.
According to him, the Russian economy would begin to decrease at a price of less than $90/barr.
In Goldman Sachs also noted that the CB has not yet been able to reduce interest rates in the economy.
The paradoxical picture is observed: inflation has fallen and banks have become rising.
This may mean that they did not believe the CB that announced the transition to inflation," Clemens Grafe said.
The Bank ' s percentage policy does not affect market rates, only affects interbank credit rates.
"For the CB, it's a failure of all hope," said Clemens Grafe.
Banks are not used to credit the economy but to manage their liquidity
As the rate declines, the exchange rate changes immediately, which means that the funds are trying to get out of speculation against the rubles.
"In the early hours or late, the CB will realize that this strategy is not working," said Mr. Grafe and recalled that the State is planning to release the rubble into free navigation by the end of 2015.
However, either before or after raising the key rate of CB (5.5%), he believes.
It is estimated that the rate of rubbing is now artificially high by 10%.
I only have one way to do it, a weak one, and the expert concludes.
But if the CB is to blame in the financiers even a shadow of doubt that the elimination of the currency corridor is not a part of the policy of weakening the rubble, it may be much stronger.
A second assembly of the peoples of the South Ural took place in Chile.
The Forum is dedicated to the Day of People's Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of the Russian State and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
Delegations from all cities and areas, representatives of national and cultural associations, religious denominations, legislative and executive bodies participated.
The forum's course is aimed at strengthening international agreement.
We can set an example here not only for other regions but also for other countries.
We don't have any differences or differences.
We live in full mutual understanding," says Feofan, mitropolit Chelabian and Zlatoustowski.
A number of issues were considered during the meeting, including the education of patriotism, cultural cooperation.
As a result, the assembly adopted a resolution.
The informal part of the forum continued in the theatre of operas and ballets.
The exhibition of national and cultural associations in the Chelabian region has been opened here.
Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany on the United States intelligence issue
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence informer, said he was ready to go to Berlin to give testimony to the German Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, were unable to answer questions about their activities.
The German MP Hans-Christian Strfhehele met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was given asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter from Mr. Snouden, who introduced the media in Berlin on Friday, he said: “The results of my efforts have been clearly positive, my Government continues to be inconsistency as a change and is trying to criminalize political statements by criminal charges that do not provide any protection”.
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snoudden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States Government to renounce criminal charges against it.
The charges brought by the U.S. Ministry of Justice include the espionage and theft of public property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Minister of the Interior, told Time Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to speak to German officials, we will find ways to do so.”
The relationship between the United States and Germany was strained after allegations that the ANB had been listening to the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Opperman, a member who led the parliamentary intelligence group, said that if there was a chance of listening to Mr. Snouden as a witness, “without risking him or destroying his relationship with the United States completely”, it should be used.
Mr. Strfheil, a parliamentary member of the Green Germany party, posted his photo with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strfheil said that, according to the lawyer of the former ANC contractor, Mr. Snouden could not return to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden had given a testimony in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be there “in security”, the deputy said.
Mr. Snouden said in his letter that he had met with a “hard and constant” campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said that he had been encouraged by the global response to “his political statements”.
Citizens around the world, as well as senior officials, including in the United States, have seen the disclosure of an uncontrollable system of biased bias for society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved”.
Frontier Airlines will take the pay for the hand bet
Frontier Airlines plans to take from passengers up to $100 because they carry a handhold on board their trip.
Frontier Airlines plans to start taking up to $100 for a hand deposit and $2 for coffee or gas, although their announcement on Wednesday announced that passengers would be able to leave the whole bank.
The new handbag fee is applied to the bags in the upper luggage compartments, so the small bags placed under the seat will remain free of charge.
Frontier said it would take $25, if the collection was paid in advance, and $100, if the travelers would pay only when they went to the landing.
Frontier Kate O'Malley said that a $100 salary should make passengers pay early.
"We don't want to pay for it," she said.
The airlines began to pay for the first and second baggage bags in 2008.
Passengers who try to avoid these charges are getting as much as they can in a handbag that is placed in the upper luggage compartments as often as possible, which is why there is often no room in these sections.
Collections are one way to make passengers carry less on board.
O'Malley said that this new collection really wasn't for making money.
The case is that Frontier's most loyal clients claim that finding a place in the top luggage sections is becoming more and more difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline site will not be required to pay.
This means that one passenger in turn can be able to carry the bag free of charge while the next passenger in turn can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that the modification of procedures on the website and the frontier registration stock was intended to ensure that passengers would know about the collection before they went to the landing site.
The new Frontier collection by hand will not start before summer, although the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about luggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of the luggage is worth money, and the passengers who need this service must pay for it.
Many in Wall Street believe that adding baggage charges is a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of aircraft after several years of losses.
Most of them, however, did not pay for the hand bet.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first collection three years ago, and another discounter Allegiant Air followed her example.
The only other airline with such a collection is Hungarian Wizz Air, said J. Sorensen, a consultant for the airline, who carefully monitors the additional collection.
According to its assessment in the December 2011 report, the collection of the manual bet is $50 million per year.
Sorensen, former top manager Midwest Airlines, had recently flew the Spirit flight, and he was curious that he would find himself on the landing when the passengers met with the unusual collection of Spirit for a hand bet.
"The landing process was the smoothest thing I've ever seen in my airline career," he said.
I expected to see a toothbrush and a dragon coming out of the landing.
The plane was flying, he said, "and the landing went through a hurry."
Frontier is also required to pay Spirit for $2 for coffee, tea, gas or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who receive gas or juice can leave the whole bank and that the flow of coffee will be provided free of charge.
It will continue to be free of charge.
US Airways had recently tried to pay for drinking in 2008, but had refused it seven months later, after the passengers began complaining and no other major airline followed her example.
Frontier's initiative to pay for a hand bet when passengers don't buy tickets directly from the airline is its last step to attract customers to their website.
The airlines pay online ticket sellers, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them rather than to contact the Tourist Online Agency.
However, Frontier went further on in this area.
In September it began to give twice as many bonus miles as a frequent passenger to customers who bought tickets via an online tourism agency.
On Wednesday, it cut the premium per mile to 25 per cent of a mile of travel.
So, a 1,000-mile trip from Frontier, acquired from an online tourism agency, would make it 250-mile.
In addition, passengers can choose their location in advance only if they buy tickets directly on Frontier.
Frontier has a loyal client base in her home town, Denver, but her business is falling down and becoming profitable.
The surplus fell by 9 per cent and the summer capacity decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results published in the middle of the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to correct Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sale.
AnB guilty of “internal error” rather than hackers to stop the site
The Secretary-General of the National Security Agency stated on Friday evening that the termination of their site caused technical failure for several hours rather than hackers, as stated in the network.
“NSA.gov was not available for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the planning update,” the intelligence agency reported in an official e-mail.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Claims that the break in work was caused by a distributed "rejection" attack [DDoS] are not true.
Earlier this evening, the online server monitoring system registered that the NB site was not working for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable to some users.
ABC News reported earlier that the Agency ' s internal secret network had been broken.
No confidential information was in danger, the representative said.
At least one online hacker group of activists stated that it was responsible for the removal of the ANB site through DDoS attacks.
The DDoS attacks are designed to disrupt the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site is out of construction.
The hacker tactics are relatively simple, and attacks are not designed to penetrate the internal target system.
The former Super-secret AnB, once known as the Non-Agency, has been at the centre of public attention in recent months and has been severely criticised following a series of disclosures about its extensive foreign and internal reporting programmes, all of which have been a response to the secret files of AnB stolen from the Agency and published by former staff member Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy around the Agency has led to the fact that today's incident has been the result of targeted hackers.
Bombardier's income decreases with the drop in supplies and the number of orders on aircraft
The Bombardier Corporation, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported a 15 per cent reduction in net income on Thursday, with the impact of the reduced number of orders and delivery of aircraft in the third quarter and the problems with contracts in its railway division.
Bombardier, also located in Montreal, has not published any data on its new CSeries flight tests and has not provided any new information on whether ambitious plans for the introduction of the aircraft into commercial operation will be implemented by next September.
After the first flight of an experienced aircraft, held about half a month ago, it only flew three more times, which raises questions as to whether the time-limit test is in progress.
The results did not justify projections and resulted in more than 8 per cent of the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerxen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment on Thursday from “over-average” to “medium-market” because of the belief that stock growth is limited in the next quarter or two.
“Despite the decrease in the number of airships, we are, of course, disappointed by the revenues of the transport department,” Doerksen said in the fund market review.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders from CSeries as the flight test programme continues.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, we expect the market to be more skeptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family will be able to take a position in the lower price segment of the market where Boeing and Airbus are now dominated.
The first experienced aircraft sample was presented in March and the first flight took place in September after a few months of delay.
However, firm orders for CSeries have not yet been too much, 177, since potential buyers are waiting for the results of the summer tests to verify the company's allegations of fuel efficiency and the potential economy of the new liner.
There are currently 403 orders and arrangements with 15 clients and operators.
Chief Executive Director Pierre Boduan was confident that Bombardier would achieve its goal in 300 firm orders at the time of the first aircraft launch in commercial operation.
On Thursday, the leaders also assured analysts and media that the programme was moving forward.
“The aircraft test model did not remain on the ground longer than expected,” Boduan said during the telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software upgrades were planned during the time of the simple aircraft.
All manufacturers plan different tests.
We decided to take the first flight and stop the upgrades, so we did.
This will take place throughout the flight test programme.
A second of the five test samples must fly in the coming weeks, and all the others will follow, as reported by the company.
However, the analysts are skeptically referring to the statement that the first client will be able to start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier stated that it would assess the timing of the operation and provide new information within the next few months.
“This slow rate of summer tests, although apparently consistent with Bombardier’s internal schedule, supports our view that entry into service will be transferred to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter, ending 30 September, the net income of Bombardier fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, with $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
The adjusted profit for the stock remained at 9 cents earlier.
The gross income has decreased slightly from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected 10 cents of stock and gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth aircraft manufacturer reported in the world that he had placed 45 aircraft over the quarter, which was less than the previous year — 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The airline portfolio was $32.9 billion on 30 September, with no change since 31 December.
“The results in the aerospace area were consistent with our objectives, but a small number of orders are coming and the general market conditions have become an unacceptable factor,” Boduan said.
Total aerospace income fell by 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, reported that the gross income in this sector increased by almost 11 per cent to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in the transport department amounted to $32.6 billion on 30 September, a little higher than 31 December.
The revenues of the transport unit have been negatively affected by the implementation of several major contracts.
The Guide stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
The shares of Bombardier, which also announced that the principal financial director of Google Patrick Pichett would join the Board of Directors, fell by 8.5 per cent to C$4.83 in the middle of Thursday.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the third world-wide commercial aircraft manufacturer and the closest competitor of Bombardier, reported a 10 per cent reduction in quarterly income on Thursday.
Sony expects a lower annual income
The Japanese electronics manufacturer, Sony Corporation, completed the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced the forecast for the current financial year.
Sony's results from July to September 2013 were more shocking than was expected to be related to the fall in demand for televisions, video cameras and personal computers produced by the Japanese corporation.
Sony's television business, which brought operating income of $5.2 billion in the first three years in the quarter, again dropped to $9.3 billion in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is experiencing a difficult time, especially due to lower TV demand.
And while competitors are trying to find a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony's main competitors, Panasonic's company, has recently shifted emphasis on industrial components: companies' sales are growing at high rates, especially through car systems and clean technologies.
As a result of the end of the financial year, which will end in March 2014, Sony is expected to receive 179 billion yen of operating income against the expected 230 billion yen.
According to Thomson Reuters, however, analysts assumed that this figure would be much higher and would amount to 221 billion yen.
To get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding the product line.
In the middle of this month, the sale of smart hours from the Japanese corporation was announced, given a number of fashion functions, which would allow the need to deliver smartphones 100 times a day.
After Sony lowered the annual income and profit forecast, the company's shares in Tokyo opened in the morning lost more than 11 per cent of the price, down to the level of 1668 one by one share.
Gen's speech was a stimulant of synapses education
Researchers at John Hopkins University and Mount Sinai Medical School discovered a protein that has enabled Foxp2 to perform its function by stimulating the development of new connections between neurons.
The study was published in Science, and the journal’s summary was available on the site.
Gen Foxp2 is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
Its role was established in 2001 by the discovery of a few people who could not speak correctly and sometimes not even understand each other themselves.
Scientists have found that the work of the Foxp2 gene has been violated by family members, but how it performs its function has not been known.
In a new study, biologists have found that at least part of their Foxp2 functions as an incentive for the development of new brain synapses.
He's doing this because of another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was found as a result of the search for factors that stimulate the education of synapses.
SRPX2 has been one of 10 such genes found by the authors, and Foxp2 alone is responsible for its activity.
The fact that SRPX2 really affects vocalization has been confirmed by scientists in the mouse experiment.
When the genes were artificially reduced in animal activity, they cried less when they were separated from their mother.
If the gene activity has been restored, the frequency of the released sounds has also been restored.
Earlier on the mice, there was also a link to the Vocalization of Foxp2 itself.
The animals that introduced a human copy of the gene were more active and less frequent than normal mice.
Until now, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and the SRPX2, respectively, is linked to purely "mechanical" sound education or more delicate processes.
A cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned the head of the criminal police investigation team, was imprisoned
42-year-old Basharat Dieta transmitted information to the criminal authority of Nile Scarboro
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Royal Court.
A prestigious lawyer who told a drug baron about a major police investigation because he was afraid of disclosing his secret drug addiction was imprisoned for three years.
The 42-year-old Basharat Dieta provided the criminal authority of Nile Scarboro with confidential information on his investigation into illicit drug trafficking after being threatened because of his cocaine addiction.
A lawyer who received a call from Bas and a criminal "big lawyer" was arrested at home in 2011, following a police case against Scarboro, which he had previously filed in a drug-related court.
The officers noticed that 32-year-old Scarboro left three cocaine packets at the lawyer's house in the town of Blackburn County of Lancashire while it was at the dinner of the association of lawyers with colleagues.
The result was that Dieta was “regularly using” Class A drugs, after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his paper and on credit cards.
During the eight months from January to August 2011, he attempted unlawfully to obtain information on the arrests of two persons under the command of Scarboro and one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police surveillance at the time as part of a large investigation into the activities of the criminal organization for the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lankashire, Cambridge, Mercisiade, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later imprisoned after the police had released £1.5 million in a series of heroin and cocaine raids as well as more than £200 thousand in cash.
The 42-year-old Dieta transmitted information to criminals because of the fear that his cocaine addiction would be discovered.
Today, in the Liverpool Royal Court of Diet, which works in the legal company Forbes Solicitors, located in Blackburn, the crown was removed after his guilt was admitted in two cases of deliberate denial of justice by a court of three weeks in the Liverpool Court of Justice.
He admitted to holding cocaine at one of the previous court meetings.
The lawyer's disclosure took place after the Scarboro police investigation found that he had been regularly talking to the Child on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and found out how he got to Diett's house in Blackburn and put 60 per cent of the drugs in a black pen for golf under the garbage boxes of the lawyer.
Shortly after the transfer, Scarboro was repeatedly summoned to Dieta, who was at the football stadium in Iwood Park, Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer returned home for drugs, and nine conversations took place between them.
The court found that Dieta had “ regular use” of cocaine after the tests had found a drug trace of Class A in his hair, shirt and credit cards.
The child was later arrested, but he denied cocaine use, said he was talking to the suspect dealer because it was his client, and insisted that their communication was a “advocate secret”.
At the time of her arrest, Dieta took his wallet and tried to draw several credit cards, but they were all confiscated, and he also had a hair sample.
At the police station, he said he had a home office in addition to his workplace, and his clients came to him in legal cases.
However, the court was aware that after important arrests, it had called on the major parties to illicit drug trafficking, some of which he had previously represented in the court to tell what detectives knew about them.
In the indictment, Ann White said, "If anyone knows that the law should not be violated, he is a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Dieta was accused of abuse of his position as a criminal lawyer because he had become too close to certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer but a drug dealer providing his own lawyer.
Some of his talks would certainly prove fair, since he was their lawyer.
However, this has significantly crossed the limits of the usual relationship between the lawyer and the client.
He had obstructed police investigations as strongly as possible to enable these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Dieta didn't read his profession, but he ruined it.
He was too close to certain customers, particularly Scarboro, and allowed to doubt his lack of interest.
The child did not admit his guilt and said, “If I were a corrupt lawyer that I was not, and I wanted to pass on Mr. Scarboro’s information, I would not wait 15 hours, I would do it immediately.”
But after the meeting, Chief Officer Lee Holstead of the Lankasira Police said: “Mr. Dieta has become a criminal lawyer as soon as she has started to buy drugs from organized crime representatives”.
His passion for cocaine has made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable for the main actors of criminal groups who have commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should follow the highest standards of professional ethics and build trust and confidence in society.
Mr. Dieta betrayed that trust and tried to cover up his profession.
Mr. Dieta's investigation has led the Lankasira Specially Organized Crime Unit, which has already been sentenced to three cases of cocaine storage, and now even to an obstacle to the implementation of justice, demonstrating our desire to achieve a just punishment for the offenders.
Let this matter serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We shall find you and bring you to justice.
He himself was sentenced to 14 years after admitting his guilt in the dispute with a view to supplying heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
A further 35 persons involved in machining were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Dieta arranged a discussion in the form of questions and answers in which he said that the work of his dream was a lawyer representing clients with a death sentence in America, an ideal partner for him for dinner, Mohammed Ali, and motivation in the work is inequality.
The stadium in Yaroslavle is not ready for the reception of 22,000 spectators, reports police officers who were present at the meeting of the RFSC.
They believe that the ticket programme has been exceeded about twice.
During the 1/16 match, only a thousand squadrons were engaged by the Russian team with Spartacus, with a rule of nine thousand.
Spartacus patients had 2,200 seats, 10 per cent of the stadium's capacity, but, according to the Moscow club, they had sold 5,000 tickets.
These data were published by the Head of the CDC, Arthur Grigoryanz.
The Americans listened to Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, 1 November, one of the representatives of the American Special Services, who preferred not to disclose their names, said that the States had been listening to telephone talks by senior officials of Japan.
The man confirmed that there were several points in the rising sun to be heard.
He noted, however, that the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand did not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
He said that this was the case during World War II when these countries were allies.
And here Japan, like Germany, despite the union relations with the Americans in the post-war period, are objects for intelligence, the NHK Telecommunication Centre reported.
This information has not yet been formally commented on by any of the parties.
I remember news of the U.S. special services report for the FRG Chancellor appeared last week.
According to German journalists, the ANB has been able to listen to Merkel's phone for the past ten years.
The chancellor himself, according to some data, took notice of his interrogation very painfully.
She stated that the allies, which she considered to be FRG and the United States for decades, were such an unacceptable observation of the head of the Government.
In the meantime, Edward Snoudden said that he was ready to share details of Angela Merkel's phone conversations with German prosecutors.
Germany has specifically come to Moscow to meet with a former CIA officer.
Bacharia can exhibit grain on the market not before the beginning of 2014
In the course of public procurement interventions, the bakery may exhibit grain on the market not before the beginning of 2014, according to the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
As long as the price in the market is above and there's a question.
"Possible grain will be displayed on the market after New Year," he said at yesterday's press conference.
The Minister recalled that in the current year, farm crops under the 2013 harvest had grown to 3.1 million ha, including seed crop areas to 1.7 million ha, which was 3.3 per cent higher than last year.
In the 2014 harvest, 550 thousand ha (over 105,000 ha) were planted.
Increased areas under the zomal wheat and triangular, the flower remained at the former level.
There is no "Bratian Circle" group based on the IMF, to which Lepsa was assigned in the United States.
In the Russian forces database of the Bratsky Circle, to which Washington attributed the singer Gregory Leps, it does not matter.
As “Interfax” was noted in the law enforcement authorities of the RF, after media reports of the submission by the US Ministry of Finance by Gregory Leps to the suspect checklists belonging to the Eurasian criminal union “British Circle” were verified, but no such grouping was found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called “Russian mafia”, which is apparently operating abroad, are considered in force structures.
"Even in the very name of the 'Bratian Circle', there is some element of secrecy, there is a hint of a secret bed.
"It's all very similar to a pier-action," said the agency's interviewer.
The United States Ministry of Finance announced on 31 October that it had entered its lists of suspects belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate, Artura Badaljan, Grígoria Lepsveride, Wadima Lálina, Sergei Moskalenko, Jacob Ribalski and Igorja Schljakova.
The persons included in the list are suspected in connection with some of the Vladislav Leontiev and Gafuro Rahimov, who are considered to be members of the criminal groups and are included in the United States license lists since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Grigorio Leps is “a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev”.
At the producer centre, Gregory Lepsa refused to comment on the US charges against the singer, calling them "the board".
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama referred to the "Bratian Circle" as "substantial transnational organized criminal groups" and commissioned Minfin to "stimulate and condemn their global criminal operations".
The introduction of a person to the blacklists of the American Mining has led to the blocking of his assets in the United States and the prohibition of business contacts with those living in the United States.
The scandal video went to the police
The head of Toronto Rob Ford, known for its scandalous and unreasonably rash, fell on the smoke of the creek.
The Canadian City Police stated that they had a video and were ready to start an investigation against the mayor.
He said he wouldn't leave his post, says CNN.
Information that the authorities have evidence of drug use by Rob Ford has appeared on the Toronto police site.
The head of the local law enforcement authorities, Bill Blair, held a press conference on this subject.
The Sheriff said that he was not authorized to share with the public the staff, but he was given the responsibility for their existence.
According to Blair, the compromised Robb Ford video was discovered during an anti-narcotic raid held in the summer of 2013.
The Canadian press had already written about the existence of this video, but there was no confirmation until recently.
The mayor himself has no comment on this.
He's just saying he's not guilty of anything and he's not going to retire.
The video found by the police is one of the evidence in the case of a 35-year-old friend, Ford Alexander Lissie, accused of drug trafficking, extortion, illegal income, and a criminal settlement.
Sometimes Lisa served as Rob Ford's driver.
The city's inhabitants have long been demanding retirement from their mayor.
He fought with journalists, appeared in a drunken audience, allowed himself to be racist and sexist.
The Rostovaeroinvest OAO recognized Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender for the selection of the projector.
The amount of the contract in Rostovaeuro is not disclosed.
According to the OAS press, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, the project was to be prepared and sent to the expert in the spring of 2014.
The winner must design a new passenger terminal for the airport, as well as infrastructure facilities, internal roads and elements of the airport complex.
At the first stage of the construction, the internal terminal area will be 50 thousand square metres, further possible increase.
According to Rostovaeuroinvesta information, the project documentation will take into account the prospects for the development of the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal could serve about 5 million passengers and by 2035, 6 million passengers.
By the time the tender was submitted, the architecture concept of the Southern Air Force was defined, developed by the British company Twelve Architects.
The project of the main terminal building is an idea of an air bridge between Rostov-na-Donu and other cities of the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience in major projects, the company has designed terminals C and E "Heremetevo International Airport" and a new airport complex at Knevici International Airport in Vladivostok.
The International South Airport complex will be built in the Asian Region of Rostov and will replace the current growth of the airport, which will be closed and integrated into the urban structure in the future.
The start of the construction of the aircraft complex is scheduled for 2014, the introduction of all facilities for 2017.
Politics in Turkey declared hunger against the border wall with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began building a separation wall in the Nusaib area of south-east Turkey.
Locals and representatives of the Procurdent Party of the CDM strongly opposed the construction.
A mayor on the border with the Turkish city of Nusaibin Ayshe Gekhan announced a famine protest against the construction of a separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, reported the RIA News in the Press Service of the Party of Peace and Democracy (PMD) on Friday.
The police have repeatedly launched protest demonstrations.
Turkey's MID head Muammer Guller initially rejected the fact of the construction, then stated that the wall was built to ensure border security.
"Mer Nusaibina Ayshe Gekhan, a member of the PMD, declared the hunger strike, thus turning his protest against the construction of the wall into a death row," said the party's press service.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish population of two countries from one another, the Kurds crossed the border freely during the half-life.
"This is an inhuman situation with which the Kurds never agree," Ische Gekhan quoted the party's representatives.
According to the press, a meeting against the construction of the separation wall was planned in Nusaibina on 7 November.
Venezuela will set a currency course for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency, a bolivar, with respect to the dollar for tourists.
This was reported by Bloomberg on 1 November with reference to the Government Decree.
Foreign travellers will be allowed to exchange the amounts equivalent to tens of thousands of US dollars per year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the goods purchased in the country at the time of departure.
A specific rate of the dollar will be set at a later date.
In February, Karakas was forced to vacate the local currency to $6.3 billion.
However, in the black market, one dollar is estimated at 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70 per cent of its value.
In September, Venezuela's inflation accounted for almost 50 per cent.
The Minister of Oil Industry and Vice-President of the Economy, Rafael Ramirez, said on 18 October that Venezuela had no plans to devalve the bolivar.
According to the informal information brought by the agency, Karakas could nevertheless decide to reduce the national currency rate after the municipal elections in December.
The price restraint policy for products and goods of general consumption, as well as the high level of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, has led to the deficit of a number of goods and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported that there was a lack of toilet paper in Venezuela.
South Director Andrei Belmach noted that it was difficult to say how long it would take to find a new master coach.
This post became vacant after Sergei Schepelev resigned.
The resignation took place only a few hours ago, so to say how long it will take to find a new coach, I'm not ready, says ITAR-TASS.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're studying all possible options.
Priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
I don't want to just find a coach, but a person like that who works at our club for a few years and gets some results.
The Kenyan Press is upset by the provocative law on media
“This is a terrible place, and there are grounds for the question: what could not be allowed to destroy the independence of the judiciary by Parliament in the future?”, the newspaper reported, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This law is very severe and punishable, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, director of Capital Group, the parent company CapitalFM, which includes one of the most respected independent radio stations and news sites in Kenya.
He said that the new media judicial body “will always be biased, as it is a continuation of the Government”, and the content and advertising restrictions would be detrimental to the situation of Kenya in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us and we ask him to reject this bill and return it to his deputies," he said.
According to The Star, the new law would in fact allow the government to “get the media a dead catch”, and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya “have been hit seriously” and criticised the bill as “draconian”.
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to strengthen national security after the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate Trade Centre.
Kenyan media have provoked the anger of the authorities by broadcasting surveillance cameras, where troops who have been sent to the scene of the attack are allegedly stealing a expensive mall.
In response to police chief David Kimayo, two journalists and media officials were called on to question, although the challenge was lifted after mass media protests.
Under the new publication law, up to 20 million Kenyan shillings can be fined, and individual journalists, up to one million at a further risk of being “exempted from the lists”, i.e. to receive a ban on official journalism accreditation.
The court shall also have the right to seize the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one fine is enough to paralyze the work of most FM radio stations”.
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on the so-called “reliving blogosphere” of Kenya.
Politicians understand that by forcing the media to shut up, they will be able to do whatever they think will be done without punishment.
“No one will ever know,” wrote journalist Nation Mutuma Matthew, describing Kenya’s media as a key source of deterrence and balance in public life.
"The policies themselves will tear the country apart and bring us back to hunting and gathering," he wrote.
Kenya's legislators were a target of public anger and of the past.
In May, they voted in favour of the abolition of the reductions appointed by the National Wages Commission and the restoration of their huge salary of about 532 thousand shillings per month, one of the highest in the world.
A new line of expenditure will be introduced in the common payments of the enemy, which will be recosting the capital of the house.
The estimated standard two-room apartment from the new year will have to be paid from 100 to 400 rubles per month.
The precise rules will determine the Government of the region.
Because when you dress up the ride, bring the stairs in order or even replace the elevator, the lodgers themselves will decide.
This law has been passed by members of the district council.
Vladimir Klücznikov, President of the Vronez Regional Word, noted: “In this case, it is also necessary to lay down the order of the house carpentry, to accumulate funds from non-governmental companies, which we often register in Moscow, or in Orenburg, or elsewhere, it will be a State control over the expenditure of funds collected by residents for the repair of multi-quarter houses.”
Under the control of the State, the construction is now on the left.
The law that protects the liars is passed by deception in final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, 4.5 thousand people have been affected by dishonest devices.
Most of the problems have been solved.
In fact, the new law prescribes rights and responsibilities for all participants in the construction of the left.
Vladimir Klücznikov, President of the Vronez Regional Word, said: “It is not a secret that abuses of the same kind have begun in this area in the same year as in the year 98 and the same ones in the year 2000.”
People started working on it to cover the lasaika, including the two laws.
Under Voronez, it was decided to build a temporary residence centre for foreign nationals to be deported.
The Regional Parliament adopted such a law not only under the auspices of the Federation.
At the same time, remove the problem of illegal migrants in the region.
Yes, over 100,000 foreigners were heard on the migration account last year.
But only every fifth had a formal permit for work.
Where the rest work and pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Kluchnikov, President of the Vronez Regional Word, said: "They have violated the law, but they are not criminals."
The courts don't have to deport them, they have to contain them somewhere.
Such a decision was taken by the Federation to equip such sites with regional resources.
In the region of Vronez, it is defined as the Old Olshan of the Semiluk region.
Well, last but not least, the regional Parliament has granted new benefits to multi-child parents.
First, families with 5 and more children are completely exempt from transport tax.
In this case, the budget is lost 3.5 million - but many parents are also saving.
Second, and the main, those who adopt the 3rd and younger, will issue housing subsidies from the new year.
For each member of the family, the new law provides for 18 square metres, at the cost of 30 thousand metres.
The family, for example, of the 6 people, the father, the mother, the child and the 3rd adopted.
For them, according to the rules, the State acquires a housing area of 108 square meters -- over 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the left bank or the South-West microregion, the option is quite acceptable.
Well, you can buy a whole catadeg at the mall for that.
Bumgertner is appointed to the Uralkalia Board of Directors
The current Board of Directors of OAS Uralkalij proposed a candidature of the Director-General Vladislav Baumgertner arrested in Minsk in a new composition of the Board, reported to the Russian company.
Bamuchertner has listed 11 persons appointed to the new Board of Directors.
This list was prepared for the extraordinary meeting of shareholders on 29 November, which will determine a new composition of the Board of Directors by voting.
Baumgertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
In August this year, he was accused of abuse of office.
However, the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, said at the press conference that the allegations of Baumgertner were reclassified as "a robbery".
The returnee of the Nephthemik Matt Dalton refused to comment on the care of Vladimir Crikunov from the post of the teacher of the undergrowth.
Golquiper believes that the executive coach Dmitri Balmin enjoys great authority in the players and will meet his responsibilities.
Remember, "Nephthemic" has now resigned from Crikunov.
If it is true, I would not like to comment on the resignation of Vladimir Crikunov, quoted Dalton RIA as saying "Novelty".
I can only say that Dmitry Balmin will meet his obligations - I have no doubt about that.
The team enjoys great authority, and this young specialist is certainly looking forward to a great future.

And the Forvard Fabio Quailierlla recovered after the trauma and was ready to play.
The fuel travel will result in a tax manoeuvre that provides for an increase in the tax on the acquisition of useful fossil fuels (DPI) while reducing export duties and increases in excise duties.
In the opinion of the experts, these measures could contribute to the budget of an additional 619.3 billion rubles.

U.S. Secretary-General: Special services sometimes "entered too far" when collecting data
The U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that, in collecting data and interrogations, American specialist services sometimes “were too far away”, the politician noted that the media's information on the screening of 70 million people was not true.
I assure you that innocent people did not suffer during this process, but the attempt to gather information was.
Yes, in some cases this was too far away and was incorrect.
I recognize that, as the President also acknowledges... and we will be monitoring that this does not happen in the future," the Secretary-General of the AFP quoted.
Italian interns take the road to youth
Italy's unemployment is a record.
The data published on the environment showed that 12.5 per cent of the country ' s population was now unemployed.
So bad things haven't happened since World War II.
Among young people, this figure is a number of times higher.
40.4% of the population between the ages of 15 and 24 are unemployed.
According to the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is the early retirement of older workers.
Such an experiment is already being carried out by the country ' s largest energy company and the laws adopted allow regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement pension for intern workers.
On the other hand, Italy expects a common problem for the elderly for Europe.
And economists are not sure that a delay in the early rotation of staff is justified.
What will lead to the construction of TPU in Moscow
Each year, civil authorities pledge to build increasingly transport-persidual bridges (TPIs).
By 2020, it is planned to introduce 255 TPUs.
As far as the project is concerned, our correspondent understood it.
A few months ago, the Arbatsko-Pokrovska Metro was built.
The signature stated that the transport-passenger unit was being set up.
All this was very strange, as there was no land transport being stopped near Smolensk and, therefore, it could not be moved.
In order to reach the nearest trolleybus stop on the Sada wheel, it is necessary to pass some 130 metres, including a land crossing through the Carmanic Peninsula.
It's almost all over now.
A flower lare, a demountable paper stand, and the asphalt was replaced by a bristle before the entrance.
That's all the transport.
Transport-per-urban bridges are flat and capitalized, explained in the press services of the city transport department.
There are no capital IPRs yet.
The flats include the construction of parks, the conclusion of commercial facilities that prevent passengers from moving, the creation of small architectural shapes and well-being.
In fact, flat IT does not even deal with transporters, but professional charity workers from the capital repair department of Moscow.
The transport undertaking is not necessarily a complex design, explains the Director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the University of Economics, Mikhail Blinkin.
Sometimes enough covers over the head and the board that announces the time of arrival of the transport.
For example, the Yasenevo Metro has recently opened a fully valued flat replanting plant.
Let's leave without the blankets, but with the pick-up parks and a board indicating when the bus arrives.
But in pursuit of the number of officers, they record everything in the ICU.
As early as 2011, Mary planned to build all 151 of them, 59 of them with capital construction.
So far, there are up to 255 TPUs in the plans by 2020.
Half of them promise to surrender this year.
While there is a programme for development of the IPU, no qualitative criteria are identified, Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the State and Transport Organization.
The number of objects is reported, but the transfer quality of each of them is often deteriorated.
The criteria, in the opinion of the expert, must be two: firstly, a reduction in the transfer time, secondly, a convenience.
First of all, it is possible to change the type of transport without rain.
In Moscow, however, the TPF is sometimes turned upside down.
A bright example of the VDNH Metro.
Earlier, beautiful buses from the Yaroslav Shoss had arrived in the quarries before the main entrance to WVC.
Their arrests have now been transferred to the opposite side of Yaroslavka on the Cosmonaut Street.
Far from the subway, far away from the monoreel, so close to home.
Because the people did not really want a car under the windows and complained at all possible instances.
With the capital ICU in Moscow, there was no delay.
The first of them started building five years ago at Plannerna Metro.
The project was designed to be a model.
And indeed, a sample of how the replanting of the purchase of investors is turned into a shopping mall.
No, there's a bus wall, a bridge to keep you from going from the subway to the rain, and three floors of the parking lot.
True, the chemical trolleybuses No.202 and No.203 in the Moscow TPU did not give seats in principle.
They're as far away from the subway as I've gone.
That's why there's more places to trade.
There are only 32 shops in one suit, and there are almost everything from zoos to car salon.
Well, in fact, secondly, who of the bus passengers would need to buy a new car in the way?
We've got when we're building a capital market, why is there always a trading center?
The situation recently reached its logical conclusion when some of the drivers decided to put it under the market.
Now, on the third floor of the TPU, Plannerna is in the middle of the parking lot.
Plants, spices, Chinese jeans, nerves, and security guards who look at our photographer.
The replant was finally turned into a market.
The thing is, Planner's subway used to be a market, but it's been taken off.
And in the prefecture, the traders complained and let themselves into the catchment area of the replanting plant.
Still, because of high prices there is always empty.
The funny thing about the market is to build on it... a new flat-screen ICU.
That's the rocking.
The "Kalujski" metro distance from the west of the metro to the bus was 50 meters, says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the trade centre, the TPI reportedly increased to 170 metres.
To get on the bus, we have to go through the entire shopping center.
After 22 hours when he's closed, he's going to be surrounded by the open sky.
By the way, the design of Planner and Kalujska will soon be shown by flowers.
In mid-September, the Mayor ' s Urban Land Commission adopted planning decisions for the first eight capital IAPs.
Four of them would be 25-year-olds, without considering two or three underground jars.
The main sample will grow at the Tushino Metro, which will be 418.7 square miles [418.7 sq km] of the area.
The representatives of the RJD Railway Stations Directorate, responsible for the construction of the metro, have already told reporters: stores, hotels and apartments will be in the future.
In this way, officials are sure that multi-year parks are worth between a third and a half of the area.
Take, for example, the "national" garages.
For example, the 258 parking garage, recently built on the International Street, has an area of 8015 square metres.
So for a parking lot of 2.6 thousand cars at Petrosko-Razomowski, about 80,000 "squares" will be needed.
It's less than a third of the machine they're going to build.
Let one or two floors go on every bus platform.
It remains at least 150 thousand square meters of commercial property.
And that's, for a minute, almost two GUMs.
If the capital IPRs are built by railways at stations and trains, the remaining sites will be occupied by the metropolitans.
They also promised that there would be many " functional objects", including hotels, offices and even sports halls.
In fact, the property department of Moscow has recently informed journalists that they are developing a draft decree that investors will be able to contact officials directly for the IT site.
No competitions.
Therefore, I prayed that transport issues for the city were a priority.
The ideal TPU is, for example, Garvard station in Boston or "Spadyna" in Toronto, sure Alexander Morozov.
There the trolleybuses and trams are landing underground at metro level and the distance from the metro to tram station is only 50 metres without going to the street.
No more trade.
But the Moscow officials are in the end.
Either we're not going to build anything or we're gonna have to rent 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Esser proposes to compare the abuse of patriotic feelings with extremism
In order to protect the patriotic feelings of citizens against provocations and insults against Russia, the Justice of Russia proposes to equalize the patriotic feelings of extremist activity and punish the five years in prison.
As reported in the Newspaper, such amendments to the legislation prepared by the mental committee on energy by Oleg Mikheev have already been sent to the Supreme Court and the Government.
Under the patriotic sentiments of citizens, the author of the amendment proposes to understand the emotional relationship of a person with the country of which he is a citizen, who is in love with that country, who is responsible for its fate, respect for its history and culture.
According to Miheev, domestic law provides for sanctions for abuse of the formal signs of the State authority, the flag and herb.
However, in the opinion of the parliamentary, protection of Russians whose feelings may be affected and insulting public symbols and other manifestations of disrespect for our country, Russian legislation has not been sufficiently worked out.
As an example, it presents an annual event in the Canon of Victory, when some media individuals allow themselves to question the heroic rise of the people of the USSR in the fight against fascists.
Prior to the main public holiday - the Day of Victory on 9 May - the current vacanal is being launched annually.
While exercising in an astrological and "alternative view" of history, some publicists argue that, unfortunately, cultural Germans have not won the wild Soviet Union!
I consider this to be absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the nation's main "spiritual strength"," regrets Oleg Mikheev.
In addition, according to Miheeva, patriotic people in Russia are much more than religious, but the law penalizes the feelings of believers, and it is possible to insult patriotic feelings virtually without punishment.
In the opinion of the electorate, it is necessary to compare the insulting of patriotic feelings to extremism and to prescribe the appropriate punishment in article 282 of the Penal Code.
The bill provides for a punishment for insulting patriotic feelings, ranging from a 100-year sentence to a five-year sentence.
The earthquake of 6.6 occurred on Thursday, 31 October, in the Kokimbo area of central Chile, and the Reuters Agency is transmitting.
Earthquake was located in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and 54 kilometres south-west of the city, specified on the U.S. Geological Service (USGS).
The scores were recorded at 20:03 on local time (3:03 1 November in Moscow).
Victims or subterranean blasts have not yet been reported.
Remember, Chile is in one of the most seismic regions of the Earth, so the earthquake of different forces is not rare.
One of the most serious events occurred in 2010.
At that time, the earthquake of 8.8 and the tsunami caused more than 550 people to die in Chile and the destruction of 220 thousand buildings.
In addition, the most powerful earthquake in recent history has occurred in Chile: 9.5.
More than five thousand people were killed as a result of that natural disaster.
Dmitry Medvedev: the Greenpeace case will be considered fairly
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev reported on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists would be dealt with in strict accordance with Russian law.
France may not doubt that the case will be dealt with in compliance with the legislation, which we hear all the concerns.
"We can guarantee compliance with the laws," said Dmitry Medvedev at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean Mark Ero.
Among the detained activists Greenpeace is a French citizen.
Pierre Pizanou, as well as the other activists, are charged with felony.
"I asked if we could expect humanitarian violence against a detainee," Mr. Ero quoted RIA News.
"Our country cannot support activities that can harm the environment, no one is entitled to break laws," said Dmitry Medvedev in turn.
He said that the activities of any structure that sought to influence technologically complex and dangerous processes, including energy generation, were dangerous.
He stressed that these objects were "as dusty as dust" and recalled what had happened in the Gulf of Mexico, delivering "RIA News".
UN announces new poverty eradication goals
The United Nations should begin its work immediately on a new set of challenges for the replacement of the Millennium Development Goals, which had been formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty worldwide.
Australia ' s diplomats played a key role in the promotion of sustainable development goals for the MDGs, which expires in 2015 until the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro earlier in the evening.
They were included in the outcome version of the document, which would be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, at the summit.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Pan Ki-moon, told the summit early in the evening that it was now time to “become more of national interest”.
“I am pleased that the UN member states have agreed to launch and monitor the process of establishing the universal objectives of sustainable development, the ESD,” he said.
These ESDs will build on our progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, which will become an integral part of the post-2015 concept of development.
I will make every effort to use the powers given to me by the Member States to translate our vision of the objectives of sustainable development, which are based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing as a result of the conflict of influential people
Under the view of them at the bottom of the statue of Samara Maschel, the President-in-Office of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered at the center of Maputo to scandalize the slogans of peace on one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want peace to return; we want stability,” said Vanessa de-Susa, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing the future of her country, she changed her business suit to a football club decorated with the inscription “We Require Security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the Table of Independence.
Within two weeks, almost daily reports of clashes between the government forces and Renanam were received — one of the worst conflicts since the truce was over 20 years ago.
Renom was once a well-known rebel movement, supported by the white authorities of Rhodesia, and then by the Government of South Africa, the apartheid era, as part of efforts to destabilize the independent Government of the country.
After the 1992 revolution, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is likely to return to full-scale conflict, but recent developments have forced foreign investors and locals to be energized.
High rates for the fast-growing economy, as the opening of huge greenhouse gas and coal reserves in the north-west may attract more than $50 billion as investments in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
Frelimo, a leading political force since 1975, and Renamo, are indicting each other for the tensions they have created.
The Renom Party argues that the Government has become a prisoner of the last clashes, attacking its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional area of Renom, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels then intensified when government forces attacked the Rhine and attempted to kill Afonso Dlakamu, the leader of the group, reported Financial Times Fernando Mazanga, representative of Renamo.
The Government blames Renom for initiating clashes, accusing the party of attacking the soldier.
President Armand Gebuz tried to raise concerns about instability.
Gebusa told the French information agency AFP on the Wednesday that Mr. Dlakama had felt “a failure”, who wanted to use “all that remained of his strength to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the Government”.
Both Frelimo and Renomous insist that they want to avoid war.
However, the fears grew after the report that Mazanga had stated that Rehoboam had refused the 1992 peace agreement.
He informed the Financial Times that it was a violation of the agreement by the Frelimo party.
"Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but with all seriousness," Masanga said.
The previous negotiations between the parties had little to do with the tension that had intensified the series of clashes this year.
“These are two influential people (Gebuza and Dlakama), who have met with their lips,” said Joseph Hanlon, lecturer of the Open University and expert in Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them are ready to attend the necessary appointments.
The Renamo Party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already stated that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weaker movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the Government.
The proportion of the votes for Renana has decreased since 1992, while the new Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which is based on a former member of Renanam, is expected to improve its performance in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gabuza, who had to leave the post next year when his second term ended, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want multiparty democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency," Masanga said.
It is not clear what possibilities Renanam has, but it has already carried out destructive and intimidating attacks on police stations and cars on the key highway from the north to the south.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, located hundreds of miles north of Maputo, but included Beirut, a port used by mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railways about a week after Renom was threatened by an attack on the railway.
Masanga was withdrawn when he was asked if Renamo would repeat the threat.
The Renamo Party wanted to “warn the international community that things in Mozambique are not going very well”, Masanga said.
Disability has increased the discontent of the Government, and many people are also concerned with corruption, slow development and recent kidnappings, said Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, which should find a solution to these problems,” he said.
Omar Sultuan, part of the demonstration, said that people just want stability.
"No one cares about the Rhine or Frelimo, they just want to restore peace, they want free access to roads," he said.
The series of premiere films "Art Mainstream" will take place in Moscow
The Art Mainstream film series, where viewers can see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before their release, will take place at the Rolan Film Theatre from 1 to 5 November, reports the RIA News with reference to project organizers.
Opens the Art Master's program by the French director and actress Reim Kerichi, Paris at any price.
This is a story about the model Maya (Sam Kerichi) working in the French capital, which is being deported to Morocco due to a visa issue.
In addition to Kerichi's film, the viewers will also show a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki Duka "Mebius", the melodramatic biographer Oliver Hirshbigel "Diana: History of Love" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the main role and the main film of the Cannes Film Festival "Life Adel" Abdelatif Keshish.
The only Russian participant, Art Mainstream, will be the winner of the film by Alexander Veledin's Geographe Globus Propil at the "Kinotavr" Festival.
The main role - the promising failure of the teacher Victor Słujkin - was played by Constantine Habensky in the film, whose work was also marked by the prize "Kinotavra".
Children should study myths and legends as “life patterns”, the author said.
The Tale's statements could show that “a hard force can't defeat the cleverness,” and the legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Many myths are said to be “too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too rude to teach in schools”, Crossley-Holland advocates the “adult selection” of texts at an age.
“I think it’s wonderful that myths and folklore in America are already part of education,” he said.
I voted in favour of introducing them into the 20-year training programme.
He added that “exceeding morality” was “interesting” for children by the authors and teachers, and the main ideas were “sublimated” in fascinating stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowolf from English-Saxon, and wrote the Norwegian Mifle Collection for Penguin and the British People's Stories, said: "Of course you may have intentions, but you better keep them with you."
Perhaps there is a great difference between the adult author who writes for adults and the adult author who writes for children.
It is not that everything should be simplified or brought to a happy conclusion, but that it is necessary to have a clear understanding of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; it's revealed through history, not clearly formulated.
Old principle: to show, not to tell.
In the Vronez area, a football fan broke down the window in the waiting room
At nine o'clock in the evening, on 29 October, at the Georgian-Vornian transport police station, two football fans from Moscow were taken off the passenger train.
Going to the game of the favorite team, the guys on the way set up a drunk deboss on the train.
Young people were delivered to the police station at the railway station in order to prepare a protocol on administrative offences.
There the fans were torn apart in their anti-social behavior.
The police formed administrative material on them and dismissed them.
Young people bought tickets for the next train and were waiting for him to arrive at the station.
In the middle of the first night, the fans left the railway station, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly came back and broke the door in the waiting room.
There was a crash on the broken-glass bell by a transport police officer and security guard at the RZD.
They were able to detain a criminal who tried to hide from the scene.
South-East LU staff are being audited by Russia's MVD.
The issue of the initiation of a criminal case was resolved by the senior reference to the information and public relations of the South-East IWL of Russia on the transport of Sergei Olhovik.
Vital Mutko: Watermelons?
I think we're back 15 years.
Minister of Sports Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion on the riots at the tribunals during the Battle of Kubka Russia "Skinnik" - "Spartak".
I'm in favour of all of this being the organizers of sports events: clubs, leagues, RFS.
But we can see that they took a position.
They're waiting for someone to come over and order.
It's a very good position, but it's not exactly right.
Patients should be organized, clubs should invite their drivers instead of letting things go alone.
We have now developed a special Government decision on the rules of conduct at the stadiums.
Once it is adopted, we will take care of this problem.
But I am still obliged to invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read Leonid Fedun's interview.
State, please, give the law a hurry.
It's such a feeling that the Bavarian patients came to Yaroslavl and arranged all of this.
And we're alien observers.
And it's terrible to see the tribe being driven out of the brandpoint.
And it's in the country that's preparing for the world championship.
"I feel like we've been back 10-15 years," Mutko said.
Snoudana can be questioned in Russia
The former U.S. Specialist Edward Snowden will probably not go beyond Russia to give evidence of the hearing of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone negotiations.
As Interfax stated on Friday, the source familiar to the situation, an American can answer questions from the German Public Prosecutor ' s Office in writing or in an eye.
The departure of Edward Snowden outside Russia is practically off.
"In this case, he loses the refugee status and may be issued to Washington by US allies," said the interviewer of the agency.
"However, in principle, the FRG's Office could send its representatives to the FF or forward written questions to Snouden," added the source, adding that the issue should be handled at the inter-State level.
Former German Bundestag's deputy Hans-Christian Strebele reported that Edward Snowden was ready to give evidence on the case of a hearing by the US special services of the German Chancellor of Negotiation.
Snouden is willing to testify to the German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or in the territory of Germany.
The CIA's ex-employee made it clear he knows a lot.
Despite the fact that the U.S.A. has blocked all its movements, Snouden is ready to come to Germany.
However, this requires a clear definition of all the conditions of his arrival," Strebele told the Euronews TV channel.
Advocate Snouden Anatholiy Kucheren, commenting on the "Interfax" source, said that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how he would decide on his own.
U.S. citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (UNB) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after reporting on the secret transactions of U.S. intelligence services on the Internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow transit, but could not leave the airport because his passport had been cancelled by the US authorities, who had made serious accusations to him, and remained in the Sheremetevo transit area before the beginning of August.
On 1 August, Snouden received a document on granting him temporary asylum in Russia for a year and on the same day left Sheremetevo.
Yesterday, American lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said his client was set up for work in a "big Russian company".
A report by the German media last week about the ANB report by Angela Merkel.
According to reporters, the American Chancellor's phone calls began to be heard in 2002.
The tracking station was reportedly in the United States Embassy in Berlin.
The authorities of Germany, following the publication of this information, stated that Merkel had violated Germany's laws and sovereignty.
Ponomrev left "Just Russia"
A member of her office in Novosibirsk, Ilia Ponomrev, a member of the State Duma from the Fair Russia party, made a statement about the withdrawal from the political organization.
As the parliamentarians said, he made a statement to the new Siberian regional office of the party.
According to her law, this automatically means that Ponomrev left a number of "rights".
We'll sit down, have a cup of tea...
"Why do many want to see the picture "Elya Ponomrev puts on a parquet table," but there is nothing so epoch," the honourable Member commented.
Ponomrev noted that he maintained good relations with the regional office of the Esser.
However, Mr. Elia Ponomrev ' s mandate was not intended to be refused.
He explained that, despite leaving the party, he remained a member of the faction and could not be expelled by law.
The announcements on the intention of Eli Ponymreva to leave the fair Russia party appeared on 30 October.
It was reported that Dmitry Goodkov and Valerie Zubov would leave with him, but the latter soon rejected this information.
Japan will discuss the conclusion of a peace treaty with Russia
The head of the Japanese MIDI Fumio Kisida met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"We would like to exchange views on the further development of political dialogue, discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty," Kisida said at the meeting.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that once the Prime Minister of Japan, Sindzo Abe, visited Russia, relations between countries had become warmer and bilateral.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the RF would visit Japan to address difficult political issues, writes RIA Novosti.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies solutions to the issue of the disputed Northern Territories.
In this regard, protests are taking place in Tokyo today, demanding that the country be returned lost after World War II.
The Japanese capital is driven by cars, from which the loudspeaker says, "Return the northern territories!".
The police don't stop protesting, they're watching that there's no excess of noise.
Ben Greenman: 10th anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It can be said that New York is the birthplace of a stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, a passionate artist, Frank Fay, who worked at the Theatre Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the audience in a conversational manner.
In time, Fay's innovation was welcomed by others, recently the New York Comedy Festival.
An established and curated Caroline Hursh, founder of the Carolines Standapp Club, celebrates this year's tenth anniversary, with more than 60 shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these hedlines started in Carolines, and then they achieved more success, reached the level when they were already too famous to play at the club,” Hürsh said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year, the event includes Vanda Sykes, Katie Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as the “Standup for Heroes”, an annual musical and comedy charity concert for military veterans in Madison Square Garden, where they will appear among the other Bruce Springstin, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has expanded.
Several comics participating in the festival this year have gained popularity in a non-traditional way, for example thanks to small television shows such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was known for his role in the comedy series on a small cable channel (especially the FXX-sport League on the theme of fantasy football) and now runs his own sketch show at Comedy Central.
Jenny Slett joined both the "Saturday Night in Direct Efre" and the "Parks and Respiratory Zone", although she was most famous for the series of viral roles "Marcel - Hand in Botinques".
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with a self-styled style (surrealist pessimistic Anthony Jesselnik, a slender focused on the race theme Kamau Bell), are the result of a decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the brightest moments of the festival will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comic, but then became a successful director on television and in cinema, as well as an informal history comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the lead show on TV Land called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will be held in Town Hall, downtown Manhattan.
“This city is definitely the central part of Larry’s whole work,” said Steinberg.
He told me that when he comes here, he sometimes plays around in a corner between the two houses, and he says, "If I'm left with no money, maybe I'll live here."
Pakistani authorities began negotiations with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities started negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported by the Embassy of the country in the United Kingdom, where Pakistan's Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, is visiting.
The head of the Government of Pakistan made a statement on negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Kleggo, with which he discussed Pakistan and India's relations, the world energy market and economic reform in Pakistan.
“The Prime Minister reported that the Taliban dialogue had begun,” said in a statement by the Embassy of Pakistan in London.
He said he hoped and asked for dialogue to work in accordance with the Constitution of Pakistan," added the diplomats.
Pakistani Taliban (Tekrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of a single Afghan movement, but operate independently of it in the north-west regions of the country bordering Afghanistan.
Pakistani Taliban are seeking to establish an Islamic State.
In the past, the Government of Islamabad tried to start negotiations with local Taliban, but the movement refused dialogue.
It stated that negotiations would take place only if the authorities took the permanent deployment of troops located in the areas where the Taliban were operating and released from the prisons of the arrested Islamists.
Nawaz Sharif arrived in London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, Prime Minister David Cameron, Head of the Government of Pakistan, and Afghan President Hamid Karzai, held a tripartite meeting in London, which discussed the prospects of the peace process in Afghanistan.
The oil dropped to $96 for the barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, when the concerns about large stocks had become cloudy, indicating that China's energy-intensive manufacturing sector had gained power.
The U.S. ethanol oil stock was delivered in December at 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 for a barrel at a late morning European time in electronic stores at the New York Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract was awarded 39 cents, which amounted to a drop in October price of 5.8 per cent.
The rich oil stocks have influenced its value over the past few weeks.
The Ministry of Energy stated on Wednesday that US stockpiles have increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, more than 25 million barrels were filled.
However, on Friday, there was an indication of a potential increase in demand, according to two reports on the Chinese industry showing the collapse of its activity.
This indicates that the recovery of the economy of China could continue to take effect after the growth rate in the third quarter rose to 7.8 per cent after a 20-year minimum in the previous quarter.
The oil Brent, also used by U.S. oil-processing companies, provided 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel at the London Intercontinental Stock Exchange.
The lead coach of Colorado Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release the Golchiper Semen Varlamov from the first minute in the Friday match with Dallas, expressed confidence that the recent night after the end did not break his confidence in the desert, he passed from Dallas to Natalia Šmelev.
And what we're waiting for," Rua said after the morning break, "Lavin."
Of course, we all worry about what happened, but we are confident of it and feel that it will be helpful for him to get out of the ice today.
We want him to go to the ice and show his usual level.
So you're absolutely sure the situation hasn't gone through the door?
I'll see you today.
Without a doubt, our players will support Varley by helping him to guard the door, as it was in the previous season's fighters.
Mainly, no one in the team is going to make any conclusions until the court finds out.
In Siberia there is no need to be a vegan: a warm tomato will not replace a cap
Why the vegetarians are not fit for life in Siberia, the correspondent of the RIA News reported.
People who have completely renounced products of animal origin must not live in Siberia.
They do not spend the winter without losing their health, nor do any hot tomatoes compensate them, they consider the newly questioned New Siberian dietists and doctors on the day of Vegan.
Five litres of oil
The strict vegetarianism, when not only of meat and fish, but also of milk, honey, eggs, becomes a modern way of life.
Dietologists, however, are convinced that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia, there are strict food standards, at least, that they are useless to health.
Full rejection of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain irreplaceable amino acids that are very difficult to compensate for by-products.
It is necessary to include at least milk or eggs in the treatment," - confirmed dietologist Marina Godi.
It provides, for example, fish containing the unalterable fatty acid of Omega-3.
Their richest vegetable oil is linen.
"To require it in the quantities required for man, you need to drink the litres!" says the dietologist.
The doctors are convinced that the inhabitants of Siberia should pay particular attention to the treatment of winter.
In this season, vegetarianism is particularly questionable.
In our reality, there are high requirements for food.
In order not to freeze, high calories are required.
"If a person restricts himself to animal products, then he does not choose that calorie," said a specialist.
This is in agreement with the dietologist, Olga Pozniak.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not an exit.
It is better to feed primarily on products grown in the region of residence or where they were born.
The genetic code is designed to improve the adoption and transformation of these products.
And the winter people don't want to bite, but the hot ash or anything else," explains the doctor.
According to her, there may be vegans, which are actually useful for various nuts, crusts, beans, local vegetables, apples left in the winter, frozen fruit.
But that certainly is not enough for full feeding.
According to Clavdia Arifulin’s gastroenterologist, vitamins in the body are sufficient from mid-August to mid-September.
The full transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when the temperature may change by 30 degrees in the day, and in May, it is not appropriate.
The body needs energy for life, and that is, above all, fat," says the doctor.
Doctors note that vigour is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow, they need building materials, including amino acids.
And by sticking to the vegetarians, we give them to the underprivileged.
The pregnant women also need to have a high level of protein, vitamins and micronutrients in the menu.
"The devils do not receive them," --God is sure.
Arifula says that an adult is willing to choose whatever he likes to "play in the games he wants."
He's already got the body, the skeleton, the organs.
Still, children need to be fully fed.
If parents miss him some micro-elements or amino acids, choosing what he will be, it's just a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of certain substances for brain development, the sight, the bones will no longer be restored tomorrow," she says.
All the medical professionals interviewed are concerned about the low quality of winters grown in warms and imported fruit and vegetables.
What is brought to us and grown in the heat contains less of the micro elements we need than (produced) in the open ground.
"The quality of the products is not that," he says to God.
Arifulin also notes that imported and warm fruits and fruit are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to harvest more crops is harmful to quality.
"The apples don't become brown on the cut, the ants quickly envy and dance, the tomatoes tasteless and unscathed," says the medical example, adding that they are probably consumed by an excessive amount of fertilizers.
And they become suppliers, not vitamins, but cells.
This was not agreed with by the Siberian Institute of Agricultural Physics, a candidate for science at Vera Petruk.
She said that, with the right approach and compliance with all the rules and requirements in the blankets, full-fledged vegetables could be produced.
If they try to get more out of the square metre, then of course, they'll be more frequent, and they'll feed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow rapidly, they are big, but they're watertight and insatiable," she explains, adding that the quality issue, first of all, depends on the manufacturer's conscience.
The Court suspended the enforcement of a decision on “stop and search” in the New York Department of Police
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal of the Federal District suspended the execution of a court order requiring changes in the “stop-and-search” program of the New York Department of Police and removed the judge from the case.
The Court of Appeal of the Second District of the United States stated that the execution of the judgment by Judge Sheindlin would be suspended until the results of the appeal were obtained by the city.
In August, the judge decided that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing a street detention and interrogation programme.
The city appealed to its decision and decision on corrective measures, including the requirement to appoint a controller to assist the police department in changing its work practice and its related training programme.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard a debate by the parties on the application for suspension.
The Court of Appeal stated the need for a judge to be withdrawn because it had violated the U.S. Code of Conduct and did not consider the need to avoid a demonstration of an entity, partly due to a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to the court ' s criticism.
The judge decided that the police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, without justification addressing black and Latin Americans on the "stop-and-search" programme.
It appointed an external controller to monitor large changes that included policy, training and control reforms, and decided to launch a pilot programme to test video cameras on TV in police stations where most detentions occur.
In August, New York decided to terminate the practice of keeping names and addresses of people who had been arrested after the police check.
The debate on the city's appeals should be held after 14 March 2014.
The “stop and search” tactic has been criticised by a number of civil rights lawyers.
“Research” has been in practice for several decades in some form, but the number of documented stops has increased sharply with the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 in 2011, most of whom black and Latin Americans.
In 2004, four people, all representatives of national minorities, filed a collective complaint.
The participants in the "stop-and-search" programme in the New York Department of Police say that these changes will put an end to the unfavourable practice, create a more reliable and effective police service and may influence how other departments of the police implement this practice.
Opposants claim that the changes will reduce the military spirit of police officers, not crime levels, lead to unnecessary money losses and do not solve a more global problem of complex police conditions due to a reduction in officers for several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she did not stop the practice of “stop-and-search”, which was in line with the Constitution, but changed the way the New York Police stopped people.
A pedestrian zone was opened in the area of the Third Bay Gallery
A new pedestrian zone appeared in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Tretejakov Gallery and is located two kilometres from the Novokusnecka Metro Station to the Bolot Square.
All along, there are street baskets, flower shops, stones, urns, and toilets, covered by deaf billboards and illegal advertising.
In addition to the Klimentovian and Lavrusinian trailers, which have already been pedestrians, five streets have been closed for cars: the Ordinian Stock Exchange, the Big and Small Tolmachev Railway, the Kadashev Coastal and Bolotan Square.
The transport movement on the streets of Morocco and Petrovka is not limited.
On Friday, the streets from the "Newkusneck" to the "Climate Street" have created conditions for pedestrians without removing the movement and cutting off the passage, reports newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Third World Gallery, the temple of the clergy of the Pope’s Clement of Rome, the museum, libraries, monuments, and other monuments.
Previously, the Twerk Pass, Stoleshniks, and Kuzneck Bridge were completely pedestrians.
The larger Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone was opened in early September, was determined to close for outcarries and holidays.
Coulson resorted to a phone break to check the confidential message.
The former editor of the newspaper News of the World Andy Coulson reportedly used the “phone break, stroke and resistance” in an attempt to confirm the false information about Charles Clark's novel, then acting as Minister of the Interior.
The prosecutor, King's lawyer Andrew Eddies, informed the court of Old Bailey that in May 2005, News of the World had received an uncertain news report that Clark was meeting with his “an attractive special adviser” to Hanna Polby.
The newspaper ordered private detective Glenn Mulkeir to break Polby's voicemail and warn her at home to take an interview, but Coulson also called her and left her voicemail, saying the court heard.
“The accusation is that Mr. Coulson, who is now editor of NotW, is not the person who will stand by someone’s house hoping to leave someone behind, the person who likes to invite people’s history to see what they say,” said Mr. Eddie.
He said the newspaper News of the World used three ways of investigating stories: phone break, tape, and resistance.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, about the second, about the second, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone crash?
He says, “No, we say yes.”
Listening to the novel Clarke for the first time drew the attention of the editor News of the World, when the source, sexually interested in Mrs. Polby, said, "Don't waste your time, she and Charles."
The tape with the voicemail received from her phone at least three times was removed from the Mulkair house in August 2006.
The investigators also found records on the computer of a private detective in which Ms. Polby and her sister were listed as “Projects”.
Ms. Polby ' s grandmother and grandfather received anonymous phone calls during the period when she was under oath, and requested information about her, Mr. Eddie said.
At that time, former chief reporter Neville Turlbeck and former reporter James Wezerap monitored the tapes of Ms. Polby's movements.
After leaving her a vote on 18 June 2005, Coulson said: “I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow and which I would very much like to discuss with Charles.”
Mr. Eddie said that Coulson's involvement in this story was the same as with other influential people, such as the former Minister of Interior David Blancett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had entered a confrontation with Mr. Blancett about a novel with a married woman when he himself met with the correspondent Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied contact with other people in order to break up telephones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulkair, Turbeck and Wezerap have been admitted to the phone crash.
Snouden asserts willingness to contact the FRG authorities in the case of a hearing
The former CIA official, Edward Snowden, expresses his willingness to come to Germany as soon as he has the legal opportunity to do so, and to meet with representatives of the FRG authorities, reports the RIA News.
A letter from a former CIA officer to the FRG authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin was presented on Friday by a representative of the Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebel, through which Snouden transmitted the message to the German authorities.
Shrebele had recently met with Snowden in Moscow.
Four people were injured as a result of a fire on the Tver Street
As a result, four people were injured in a collaborator in the center of Moscow on Tverska Street.
According to the Interfax report, one of the victims was hospitalized with a reference to the source in emergency services.
According to the source, passersby were affected during the fire in a smoldering underground passage.
According to RIA News with reference to the head of the Central Department of Fuel and Energy Paul Livinsky, electricity has now been restored to all homes on Tverska Street.
A fire in a heat collector near the house 15 on Tverska Street occurred on the evening of 31 October.
From the banks of the river canal, a strong smoke went out, and in the underground passage at the store of Armenia, smoke was formed.
As a result of the fires, 11 houses were destroyed on the Tver Street.
At 21:45 in Moscow time the fire was extinguished.
United States dollars cut the food allowance for the poor
Food allowance for the family of four is reduced by $36 per month
From Friday in the United States, the financial provision of food talents known as foot-and-mouth disease is being reduced, as the relevant public programme is being completed.
For the food allowance, the family of four will now be allocated $36 a month less than before, official persons say.
It's going to affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in 2012 a one-person benefit was an average of $133 per month.
Food aid costs in the United States increased to $80 billion a year because of rising unemployment and food prices.
About 14 per cent of Americans rely on free food aid issued under the Fudstempam, which has been called since the time they had the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, the Republicans of Congress require further reductions in the funds allocated to the programme, stating that it should be aimed at helping those who need more.
Food store owners across America are concerned that reductions will reduce consumer costs.
U.S. Congressmen continue to argue about how much less funding can be made available to the Government.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platform for free
The Blizzard Studio released its Blackhorn platform on PC free of charge in 1994.
This is what the WoW Insider reports on.
According to him, the game became available at Battle.net in the classic Blizzard game section.
However, some gamers note that at present only those users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service can jump it.
The game is still not available for Russian users.
As media reports, the version that Blizzard has now released on PC is not different from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack to Blackthorn also remained unchanged.
The Blackhorn platform, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, originally went to SNES consoles.
Its events were unfolded on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and light kingdoms.
On one occasion, the dark ruler of Sarlak decided to kill the bright King of Vloroz and become the sole ruler of the world.
The main hero of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was saved from death by sending him to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight with the charlatans and to protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackhorn became the first game that the studio released after it was renamed Blizzard Entertainment.
Before that, she was called Silicon & Synapse.
The publisher Blackthhorne was an Interplay company.
New machines will appear in the Moscow metropolis.
But selling tickets to passengers will not be for money but for meetings.
A journey of 30 rubles will be conducted by a potential passenger at 30 meetings.
The number of meetings would be to count the special device using modern technology, ITAR-TASS reported with reference to the press services of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first apparatus will be installed at the Eastern Station on 8 November 2013.
In the presentation of the new ticket athletes, the President of the Russian Olympic Committee, Alexander Zukov, and the Olympic champions Alexie Nem and Elena Zamolodchikov, will host the event.
Admissions of the National Security Agency to strengthen paramilitary corporations with regard to public procurement
On a warm day at the end of August, the German police helicopter flew down over the US consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
Under the instructions of the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), the German Interior Intelligence Service, its task was to photograph the roof of the United States representation building, which is less than 5 km away from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media say that BfV was hoping to detect antennas of listening devices, and these actions led to negotiations between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of the U.S. National Intelligence, once again assured that the U.S. is not using external intelligence “to steal foreign companies' commercial secrets for American companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their income”.
But since Edward Snowden, a contract servant who became a informer, began publishing his secretary of U.S. intelligence, European governments and company managers no longer believe that the director can be trusted.
News that the U.S. National Security Agency has been monitoring the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and has been given access to data stored by U.S. cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, raised a paranoia-based state-owned corporation at new altitudes.
The last chapel reported that Angela Merkel's phone had been hearing for perhaps ten years.
If Europe's most influential person can be a target, then of course, it is also a potential target for business leaders.
Snouden has made clear intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies.
I think this data is probably used for mutual benefit.
“Germany should wake up,” says Oliver Green, president of the BITMI Association, which represents Germany’s small and medium-sized IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the United States is now at almost the same risk as China in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published by the EY Consulting Agency in July.
In all the documents revealed by Mr. Snouden, however, there has still been no evidence that the United States has transmitted the commercial secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU did not have enough information technology and the Internet, and expressed the view that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptically concerned about this.
Someone in the German Parliament says we have to create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not an option,” says Gasso Plattner, president of the German software provider company for the SAP business.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it should not be allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
All are subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the scope and technical development of US spy agencies, known as the Snowden, have been a shock to some companies who previously thought China's biggest risk of fraud.
There is a great deal of movement in cloud technologies, where European company managers are better aware that data stored in the United States are in the same jurisdiction and are therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 per cent of its non-American participants refused to use the services provided by the United States after the American Data Analysis Programme was disclosed to Prism.
Jim Snoweb, one of the executive directors of SAP, said: “We see that consumers are asking a new question that did not arise a year ago, namely: where my data are stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction.”
Many German leaders claim that the latest messages are merely confirmation that they already know: powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data must be protected at any price.
What is happening is not surprising.
He's always had a place.
“This has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current debate,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, and we are also spying on them, because it is in our national interests to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders usually do not like to be praised for the response they have taken, as this may give the enemy an advantage.
In large companies, it has long been assumed that taking a free flash card on a show or leaving a notebook without a look at the hotel is at least unattainable.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the Board of Directors of the Audi car construction company, says that it has been a standard practice for many years to collect mobile phones before management meetings so that they can not be used as listening devices.
The Federal Defence Service of Germany recommends that company managers consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign travel due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
The prepaid mobile phones are subsequently released.
However, there is a fear that small and medium-sized companies will remain vulnerable to seizures and seizures.
In Germany, many such companies are world market leaders in their specific niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorised access”, warns the BfV report.
In addition, the United States has provided financial assistance to the United States and the United States, which is also responsible for the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Crime.
In February, the U.S. National Intelligence Summary placed France with Russia and Israel in a second series of offenders who were hacking for economic intelligence, after China, approved The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, “Frenchs are worse all”.
Bernard Scarsini, former head of the French Internal Intelligence Agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: “The services are well aware that all countries, even when cooperating in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Parents of a youth in Georgia who died in a "unprecedented accident" believe that their son was killed
Parents from Georgia, whose body had been found inside the flipped sports mat in his high school sports hall, believe that their son was killed, said a family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from the city of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on 11 January in a vertical position mother tied behind the courts in his high school sports hall.
The Loundes County sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old family objected to this.
“They are absolutely sure that their son was killed,” said FoxNews.com Benjamin Kramp, lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he died as the sheriff said.
“They believe that this contradicts the logic, the laws of physics, and the sound sense,” Kramp said.
They believe that it is a cover for the protection of people or people responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their son to school with a school bag and brought him back to the body bag," he said.
American lawyer Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key issues remained unanswered.
What caused death?
Was his death the result of the crime?
The Wall made a statement at the press conference on Thursday.
I'm going to study all the facts where they come from.
My goal is to learn the truth.
“I hold the view that there are sufficient grounds” for formal investigation, he said.
Mur told reporters that the initial discovery showed that Johnson died as a result of “positional asphyxiation”.
However, the second discovery, according to Mura, showed another cause of death.
“There are several issues to be resolved or clarified,” he said.
Mur added that if he found enough evidence to require a criminal or civilian investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to carry it out.
The manager of the Loundes County Sheriff was not available for comment when he was contacted on Thursday.
On Wednesday, the Judge of South Georgia ordered the authorities to publish all the video footage of the surveillance camera that the investigators were watching.
Adolescent parents said that they hoped that video recordings contained the key to understanding how he died.
Spartacus: For information on persons who have exposed the Fascist symbol
A statement by the Moscow Club on the appearance of a Fascist flag in Yaroslavle was made on the official Spartacus website.
"At the Shinnik Cup Cup, Spartak, on 30 October, unknown provocators at the Yaroslavle Stadium demonstrated a fascist symbol.
We address all those who have reliable information on those who have committed this criminal offence, with a request to provide it
"Remuneration is guaranteed," says the statement.
The search for fans who launched a fascist flag in Yaroslav
Remember, in the 1/16th match, the Russian Cup of Shinnik, Spartacus, was interrupted several times because of the riots in the courts.
A Fascist symbol was also shown in Spartaca patients.
In the form of Spartacus punishment, he can carry out about three battles without vision.
There will be a meeting of the Committee on Friday.
If you have any information about who passed this symbol, please contact us.
Centres for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for schools on child allergy
In the middle of the disease control and prevention centres, a list of recommendations for the control of food allergies in children in schools was published.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the Government of the United States, while the number of school children suffering from food allergy is growing.
Now one of the 20 children in the United States has food allergies.
Disease control and prevention centres found that the prevalence of food allergy among children increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide provides information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and staff on food allergy in children and how to assist in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep adrenaline stocks — the most commonly used for injections by the EpiPen automatic medical syringe — to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The state's legislative authorities have recently amended the regulation to allow schools to make the stocks of adrenaline less difficult.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children with an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "It feels like something's going on in my language," "It feels like I have a hair on my tongue" or "the tongue of a pencil."
Parents of intersexual children can choose “unspecified gender”
Germany became the first European country to recognize the third half of children born with non-intermediate sexual organs.
New births will no longer be compulsory for male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to name any gender of such children, allowing parents to identify gender as “undetermined” or “unspecified” in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents who could make rapid decisions on the allocation of sex to newborns and to prevent discrimination against intersexuals.
One intersexual, according to the BBC, said many years later, "I am not a man or a woman."
I'll stay established by doctors as a luxury product with blues and scarves.
About one in two thousand children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of some 60 pathological states that are diagnosed with “sexual development” — the term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (yellows or semen), or unusually developed non-sex organs.
Wallis Simpson may have been an intersexual.
Gender identification has not yet been sufficiently studied, but most experts in the United States say that, if gender cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and assign it than to expect and track the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation, if at all.
The New York Psychiatric Doctor Jack Dresser, who specializes in gender identification, said that the new German law “sounds like a good idea”.
Intersexual children create ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening violations that require operational intervention, but most children do not have them,” he said.
You can assign a sex without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child develops a gender identity is not too accurate.
No one can answer questions as to why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why people are homosexual.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersexuals as different from transsexuals or transgenders, as they relate not to gender, but to their biological structure, which does not correspond exclusively to male or female gender, and typically to both at the same time or not.
These characteristics may occur in secondary sexual signs such as muscle mass, distribution of hair cover, breast and body; primary sexual signs such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides a general picture of discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender people in the field of employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and prejudice.
Now there's a special camp for boys with gender differences.
Australia and Nepal are already allowing adults to place male, female or “third sex” in their official documents.
In June 52-year-old Australian Norrie May-Walby became the first person in the world to be recognized as a “uncertain” sexist, who remained in court for the rest of his life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, the German passports will use the third symbol in addition to M and F - X, i.e. intersexual.
In neighbouring France, gender issues still raise contradictions, according to a news release on the France channel 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from France, this prominent Catholic country, signed a petition for the removal of “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American Catholic Online Web site also expressed disagreement with the German law, writing that “in a situation where the world is attracted to a new state where sex is the subject of choice and sexual activity is not, we are turning two other pillars of civilization”.
A mother of a newborn child from Maryland also reported to the Baby Zone website that she would prefer to have a sex at birth.
“It’s hard enough to raise a child without any additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s sex,” she said to her parents’ website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites — in the name of the beautiful Greek god who had the signs of both sexes.
And another ten years ago, the medical community saw the gender as a letter that you can write on and then draw again.
But now many question the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and that the doctor sometimes makes a false choice, not knowing how a child will perceive his assigned gender when he grows up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called "an emergency psychiatric case," Dresser said.
When such children were born, you did not call a psychiatrist — you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermittent genitals was suggested by Dr. John Mani of John Hopkins University, who believed that the gender was easy to change.
He introduced the term “general identity” and argued that signals of the environment, including social — how parents grow the child — interact with the genes and hormones of the child, determining whether a person would be considered a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/John, his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been damaged during a non-slip cutting, completely castrated the child, also removed his eggs, and raised him as a girl.
"Manny presented the case as a successful example of a transition, but it was not," Dresser said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he again became a boy and married a woman.
But at 38 years of age, he committed suicide.
Dresser said that some doctors are still “applying this model”.
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, the survivors of these gender-change operations declared themselves “inadequate”.
This was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes, but with genitals of an intermediate type.
The doctor could not determine exactly whether he had a large claire or a small penis, and was convinced that he would never be able to live a man’s “full life”.
Therefore, shortly after his birth in 1976, the outside sex organ and Bruce’s eggs were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At 18 years of age, he was given vaginal plastics.
But when he was depressed and realized that something was wrong, he needed medical documentation.
What he learned was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and nobody ever told me about it.
Bruce was born in a sexual development disorder that did not allow his body to produce enough testosterone for normal genital development.
When he learned the truth, he again became a man, receiving testosterone rings and removing his chest.
The operation made it fruitless.
Today, he advocates the protection of others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to bring into line the perception of people with intersexuality.
But Ann Temar-Mattis, executive director of the California Law Association Lawyers for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law “stimulates the scarf and stigma”.
“Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and give the child an “undetermined gender”, she said.
We're afraid he'll be promoting intervention.
We think it's better to assign a male or female sex and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will prove to be, so all we can do is build assumptions.
Temar Mattis said that her organization supported the Australian law because “it allows adults to make choices for the benefit of the third sex”.
“Adolescents should be able to make their own decisions on formal sexuality,” she says.
The German law implies her birth at birth.
This is a fight that small children should not enter this stage.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlin Barac, Pittsburgh's madmologist, who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law “supports” both parents and children.
The daughter of Barac, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual development disorder called “androgen insensitivity syndrome”.
Since her androgen receptors are working incorrectly, Katy has developed female signs.
She's got an intruder, but she doesn't have a mother and an egg.
Now, at 29 years of age, Katie is getting married and is going through an Ordinance on Child Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hoped to be a parent through adoption or a gesture of surrogate motherhood.
"The law gives parents time to avoid making hasty decisions on their own," Barac said.
It gives them time to do some analysis and to deal with the situation, as well as the time before they write “male” or “female”.
In that case you will grow up, love the child.
You have a wonderful child, and you have joy.
We don't have to do an operation quickly that's irreversible.
“This allows children to take part in the decision and eliminate the tension that drives parents because they don’t feel what they’re doing right,” she said.
At the end of the day, the child will decide which sex he or she is more comfortable with — and that is remarkable.
This enables children to make decisions on their own.
The Chicago Gatekeeper Nikolai Habibulin stressed that he understands what should be played better.
According to 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard at training.
In the last two "Jastrebs" meetings, Habibulin first missed six matches from Tampa Bay and then four from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth one.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I haven't been able to do this, says CSNChicago Habibulin.
- I need to find confidence in training, I think, to approach them as a game, and to try to achieve a better outcome.
You must study your past games and deal with the shortcomings that have been.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but I feel pretty good at training.
But why, after a few heads, everything turns into a snowcommer.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
Gatekeepers, I don't think I'm the only one that's always trying to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not in a hurry.
It doesn't matter what happens in front of my doors.
I'm still working on myself so I don't miss so much soap.
It's good that my roommates support it, but in principle it's simple: I have to play better.
Two games is not the whole season, but I wanted to spend them a lot better.
But it happened.
I have to put this on the side.
I'm just gonna try and play the next match better.

Medvedev expects the SSJ-100 aircraft to be deployed to Europe
Russia estimates that once the Latin American and Asian markets are established, Superjet 100 aircraft will be delivered to Europe as well.
"We expect that, in general, we will have more than 170 aircraft copies of this type of aircraft," says Interfax, Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitria Medvedev, who told them at a press conference with French Prime Minister Jean Mark Eiro.
The head of the Russian Government noted that there was serious cooperation with French colleagues, as this was a joint project.
We have discussed some financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that once this aircraft is strengthened in the markets of Latin America and in the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be provided to our partners in Europe.
"I hope he will ever be placed in France," stressed the Russian Prime Minister.
SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by the city of Suhogo in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
Liner is developed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high quality and comfort standards in 100 passenger seats.

In an old age to bring to the court of the aristocrats, the villagers on the high pillar set up a wheel from the telegram, and the heavy nest was well held on it.
Such special resistance has long been suspended, so the aisles have adorned the columns of the electric beams - the wires are wired to the wires, which makes the aisle a reliable house.
Ania’s grandmother, near her home in the village of Ivanovka in the Petikov area for twenty years, began to notice the nest sitting in spite of all the efforts of her inhabitants.
Birds put new vets on top, and the lower layer has already passed between the tracks, and that's how it's moving.
Of course, it is sad to see the family of aristocrats who have been nested in the yard every year, who have taken off and fed three or four birds for the summer, but they don't want to be left without light.
As soon as the birds flew into the warmer quarters, Grandma Anya called the Carican RESS, which has the resistance.
And I didn't even expect them to react so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovk, they were surprised that the nest was still holding, as DTEC Technical Director Sergei Berzesovski told them.
In fact, in the course of the 150 - to 200 - pound [150 - 200 kg] nest, corrosion began.
At any point, the birds could have been killed by an electric power plant.
Yes, locals were at risk of losing their lives because of damage to the roads.
The linear monters have therefore launched a nest rescue operation, which is not the first time in our practice.
Research ornithologists from the National University of Dnepropetrov have assisted in developing a nest transfer scheme.
They did training for field network staff.
A well-known dnepropertologist, Alexander Ponomarenko, advised the energy industry at all stages of nest reconstruction.
To begin with, it was estimated that there were more than 50 genuine “quarters” in the emergency area.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms had been created that would remind them of the hole.
The foundation was laid with oak beads, and then the old nest was moved there.
According to the legend, it is enough to lay old calves as a foundation for the birds to know the nest and return to it.
Then the Aztecs are building their own homes.
A month ago, the first nest was rebuilt in the village of Peschanka in Novomovski.
A number of them have installed a new iron pillar and placed on it a platform with an old nest already inhabited.
The whole operation has reached nine thousand griffins.
In days, the same new village took place in the village of Ivanovka in the Petikov district of Ani’s grandmother’s courtyard.
The platform was secured here in the former location, only underground.
Ornithologists are convinced that careful, conservative birds will not even notice the spring that their "quarter" has been refurbished.
By the end of the year, the same reconstruction is expected for four more nests in the Pokrovska and Carican districts of Dnepropertovrica.
In fact, while some rescue rare birds, others are unforgivably killed.
During the days, the entire area was filled with sad news - in the village of Ust-Camenka of the Apostolic District, on the day of the opening of the hunt for the pheasants, the bridesmaids shot the young family in the local court for entertainment.
The blessed birds did not fear the people; the locals ate them and did not grieve.
When the peasants heard the shots, they fled to the mud, four beautiful bees were already lying on the water.
The Apostolic Paradise of the militia now finds out who shot the birds in the Red Book.
Russian march is becoming more popular
On 4 November, the Day of People's Unity will be held in Moscow in agreement with the Russian March.
According to the Levada Centre survey, support for the Russian March is growing - 40 per cent of the population are already in varying degrees approving the idea of their implementation.
According to Levada-Central data, 40 per cent of the population vary according to the Russian marches: 11 per cent of them are definitely positive and 29 per cent are "faster".
The popularity of the Russian March is growing, with only 14 per cent of Russians being welcomed in 2006 and twice as many citizens (28%) were supported in December 2010.
"Determiningly negative" to "Russian March" is only 7 per cent of Russians, "preferably negative" - 19 per cent.
A further 35 per cent had not been able to formulate their relationship to this share.
This year, the Moscow Mary agreed to hold the Russian March, with up to 15,000 people in Ljubljana, today the head of the security department of the capital of Alexei Majorov reported.
This action of the nationalists takes place every year on the Day of People's Unity since 2005.
On the question of sociologists "Did you hear that on 4 November Russian marches are being conducted under slogans of protection of Russian rights in Russia?" three quarters (75%) of the citizens replied negatively.
Only one fifth of the Russians (20 per cent) know about this action.
Significantly, in December 2010, almost three thirds of the Russian marches were heard (31%).
It is recalled that three years ago, on 11 December, a nationalist natural meeting had taken place in the Manageza Square, which had gone into mass disturbances.
"Levada Centre" also asked the Russians what holiday was to be observed on 4 November.
In two years, the number of people who know the right answer (Day of People's Unity) increased from 41 per cent to 49 per cent.
On the other hand, only 15 per cent of the population are gathered to celebrate the holiday.
It is estimated that 17 per cent will celebrate the October Revolution on 7 November.
Most of the citizens (62%) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
As the Moscow Mary agreed "Russian March" in Ljubljana
On 28 October, the capital authorities agreed to hold the Russian March in Ljubljana on 4 November.
This was reported by the leader of the Russian Association, the organizer of the Dmitry Demoškin.
In addition to the sixth in Ljubljana on the Day of People's Unity, a meeting and a rock concert of the Kolovarat group will also be held in agreement with the authorities.
As in Russia March 2012
On the Day of People's Unity, in 2012, the nationalists passed the sixth from the Jakiman Coast to the Central House of the Artist, where the meeting took place.
The organizers assessed the number of participants in 20,000, and the MDG called the figure 6,000.
Communication: Obama pre-election headquarters considered the Banden exception in favour of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, the immediate advisors of President Barack Obama were secretly considering replacing Vice-President Joe Baiden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election list.
This opening is the brightest sensation of all the book Mark Gallperin and John Haylemann expected about the 2012 “Beautiful Positions: The Game Changed 2012”.
The Times received a copy of the book ready to be released and reported Thursday evening that the next assistants of the President had conducted “mass research in focus groups and public opinion polls at the end of 2011” to assess whether Baiden's exclusion could help raise the hope of re-election of Obama.
According to political observer The Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of the attempts made by senior election officials and the White House, namely the former head of the White House Administration Bill Daily, to assess the impact of the vote on the appointment of former Secretary-General Clinton as Vice-President.
A possible replacement was a secret, carefully protected in the Chicago pre-election headquarters and in the Oval Office.
Only six of the next president’s advisers — including Dale, the former head of the polling station, Obama Jim Messin, and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew that the replacement was being considered.
The book "Beautiful Positions" claims that Daley was the initiator of an attempt to replace Baiden, despite their "close personal relationships", but eventually rejected this step when their data showed that the addition of Clinton to the electoral list would not “improve Obama’s chances significantly.”
In an interview with Martin Daily, he confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Baiden Clinton.
“I was actively talking about a lot of things, and that was one of them,” Daily told the newspaper.
You must remember that the president was in terrible shape at the time, so we thought, "Oh, my God, what are we going to do?"
Although Daily described the study as “necessary verification”, Martin told CNN Anderson Cooper that the pre-election staff had invested enough in examining whether this step would bring dividends to the vote.
“The pre-election posts do not spend such amounts of money on surveys and focus groups unless they consider something serious,” Martin said in the AK 360 programme.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team had been studying the possibility of replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then boss knew about a possible overcrowding.
Although Dale said that he did not think that the president was in the process of a possible replacement, the former head of the administration acknowledged that he was in the process of “possible”, Obama knew.
Martin added that the Double Positions did not provide a clear answer to the question whether the results of political sensitization had come to Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously believed that Obama did not know about the study of the possibility of removing Baiden from the electoral list.
"Possible," said Martin.
Do you want the light in the frozen darkness?
The British entrepreneur created the world's first lighted in the dark frozen with a medium.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of the marine animal to develop a shiny food.
He came up with this idea by reading the scientific article on the media and convinced scientists in China to chemically reinvigorate the shining protein.
The frozen comes in response to the language of the ostrich, increasing the pH in the white and causing it to shine.
Chris says that since the frozen starts to light when it reacts to the warm mouth, that means the more you lie, the more it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the frozen production company "Limit me, I'm delicious," says, "This is an incredible thing, but still at the very beginning, if you talk about production, you'll get about 2 g of substance for £200."
White, which we use in frozen, will react with your language in a neutral pH.
So when your mouth burns the protein, it will increase the pH and the frozen will start to light up.
We tested it over the past few months, and it seemed to be perfect to present it in Halloween, because it creates such a remarkable glowing effect.
This may be the most expensive frozen thing I've ever done, because the medusa luminescence is four times the gold road.
So every spoon is worth me about £140.
That's why it tastes good enough.
Charlie's experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, "I want to develop the unseen frozen."
It's not possible to define it because of the breach caused by ice crystals, which is frozen, but I think we'll find a way to do that.
The frozen uses the fluorescent properties of the meduces synthesized by Chinese scientists
Coach Avangarda Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking of the preparation of his team for a regular CHL championship match against Salavata, noted that the twins conducted a thorough analysis of the defeat of the Magnitogian Metallurgy.
The specialist stressed that "Avangardu" needs to pay more attention to the defence game.
We've seen a video match against the Magnificent Metallurgy, a website called "Avangarda" by Chebaturkin.
- They missed a lot of shibs, not a very nice moment.
They have been missed because of their mistakes, because of the failure of the game.
We knew the rival had executives.
According to the statistics, they had five on-going attacks, three of them killed us.
It's a very good performance.
Have these errors been taken into account in preparation for today's game?
We're with the boys every match, we're talking after the game, we're ready for a new rival.
The main thing is for the installation to be completed.
Everyone saw the first match against Metallurgy.
The game job was done, and the account was 2:0.
They missed the target in the split, and in the third period they made a mistake.
Considering how difficult the game was, he did not see the point of joining the defenders.
Defend the whole team.
Now, Avangarda has a long home series, and the match goes through the day, and the team is tired?
All teams are in the same conditions.
The main focus is the implementation of its moments and the performance of the game.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you run the installation, it's not that difficult.
Because of the new rules introduced by the Russian Customs, hundreds of furs have been on the border with Russia for almost a week.
Today, Danish officials have promised to provide drinking water and biotowels
Hundreds of fur were dug at border crossings when entering Russia.
This situation was due to changes in customs regulations.
Ukrainian border officials and customs officials confirm that the Russian side is in place, which has not previously warned about the innovations.
Since 28 October, the Russian customs authorities have applied additional measures to ensure the delivery of goods, as reported by the Deputy Chief of East Customs Vladimir Denisov.
The new model document is applied in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Transport.
The passing points are working in a stronger way.
The FACTOV correspondent was on the border with the hostages in the situation.
The prices in the coffee travel shop at the "Novozavsk" crossing point are growing every day, as is the case with fur.
The growers are located in several rows, growing about two kilometers [2 km].
The Customs Terminal Novoazovsk - Veselo-Vosnónsk provides one of the most important transport routes from southern Ukraine on the international highway.
From here the goods are sent to the Stavropolice border of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday before midnight, they were released, and then introduced these rules, is complained of by Alexie Golovev (photo), who is carrying a transit through Russia of cargo from Turkey to Kazakhstan and has been in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules, to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and payment of the cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the value of the goods and the distance to which they are carried.
Minimum insurance is 4.5 to 5,000 rubles (about 1100 to 1300 mushrooms).
Those who go near (i.e., Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo worth up to $50,000 pay some 15,000 rubles (3800 grins) and travel.
And the rest of them are trapped, and there is none of them who can afford it.
Imagine if the driver is carrying a cargo of all four thousand dollars, but even in Moscow, he needs 90,000 rubles (about 23,000 griffins) to pay for the transit!
The conditions for survival on the border are none, and there are long-rangers who are set up next to their cars.
In border stores and cafes and as expensive as ever, but prices as here, we've never met anywhere!
The sellers went straight ahead, and they were quickly pushed: 15 griffin stands, 7 griffins, 25 griffins, and a soup plate.
And the coffee shop alone.
And there's no toilet.
I'm sleeping in the stairs, and I'm going to the bathroom.
I don't want to wash, I don't want to take care of...
I can't get out of the car for a week, my wife's done everything.
A week ago, Victor Scotarenko's another great-great-grandfather.
Is my car just coming in next week?
Why do you have half a litre of water?
There's 11 and 15 mushrooms.
What, a crystal bottle, or a silver bottle?
We have coffee, not a store.
Take as long as there's anything else, it's jamming the seller.
After the situation began to be reported to the media, Ukrainian leaders drew the attention of the authorities of the region to the plight of the media.
The management of the Amurosian and Novozasov Paradise Administrations has been commissioned to ensure that all those who stand on the Ukrainian-Russian border, drinking water, have the duty of President Sergey Dergunov.
Quick assistance is now under way at the crossing points.
Biotolls will also be installed for the convenience of people.
According to the officer, the problem of lineage will be solved in the coming days.
As reported by the press service of the Danish Ministry of Staff, 32 and 68 cars were used respectively in the international crossing points of Ospenka and Novozavsk, as at 31 October.
“FACTS” will monitor developments.
Vilnius suspects Moscow trying to slander the Lithuanian President
Russia intends to implement information provocations against high-ranking Lithuanian and Eastern Partnership countries, such a statement made by BNS in the Republic's Department of Safety (PGI).
This information is published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is going to “speak” of Lithuania's President Dalu Grybauskait and to publish falsified documents found in Russia's Gosarhive, which relate to the facts of the Lithuanian leader's biography.
According to the Special Service, the Department of Public Management of the Russian Presidential Administration on Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries is preparing an information attack.
The structure is headed by Evgenie Umerenkov, who visited Lithuania on several occasions and attended the Lithuanian People's Party.
The operation is also reportedly a member of Department B. Smirnov.
According to the Special Service, before the end of 2012, Smirnov regularly visited Lithuania and contacted local politicians, politicians and media representatives.
Smyrna is now banned from entering the territory of the country.
Recently, the President of Lithuania Grybauskait stated that he knew about the information that was being prepared for her.
In her view, Lithuania's successful Presidency of the Council of the European Union and the country ' s quest for energy independence' was the main reason.
The Lithuanian leader had not previously unanimously criticised the actions of the Russian authorities.
So she said that in the Crimea of Lithuania, "not enough respect."
In addition, Gribauskait accused RF Vladimir Putin of moving to Lithuania “one requirement”.
Remember, in September, Rossupnadzor suspended the import of the Lithuanian "milk" into Russia.
The quality of the product was reported to be not in conformity with the health and epidemiological standards.
Lithuania's leader then stated that if Russia did not withdraw the ban, the Government would have to prepare for WTO.
In the United States, the principal of the school shot teenagers.
The director of one of the U.S. high schools literally led to despair.
The man, he said, had to take the weapons and start shooting.
The incident happened in Tennessee.
According to New York Post, minor hooligans have left the house with a toilet paper.
As a result, the school director opened a shooting at adolescents, resulting in several injuries to his leg and arm, a 15-year-old boy.
Since the hooligans were not in the territory of the director ' s property, he was accused of assaulting under aggravating circumstances.
The man was released from prison for $125.000.
It is noted that shooting in the United States of America has become a horrendous rule of law.
A man literally opened a gun in the center of Rijcrest, California, right across the street.
After that, the criminal seized the hostages of two random passengers, hid them in the trunk of a car, and tried to hide.
Earlier in Newtown, Connecticut, primary school, there was a shooting.
At school, Adam's mom worked, she was an educator.
Shooting at American school: injured 14-year-old girl
A major shooting incident occurred on 31 January at the American school, this time in Anlante, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magic.
My sister and I were allowed to have confes, not to sleep late, and not to wear a mask for our area.
I'm more like a snitch now.
I haven't been calling in the last two years for confetti in my apartment, and I'm probably not gonna be here this year.
But statistics show that I'm a white crow in Halloween.
According to the National Federation of Diversification, the majority of Americans — or 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion in confetti, costumes and decorations.
The only thing I'm waiting for every Halloween is trends.
The National Federation of Divercial Trade predicts that $1.2 billion of the lost $6.9 billion will be spent on costumes.
This year, there are sexual unsurpassed items on fashion.
Women are no longer required to be representatives of sexual professions; they can also be sex food, such as pizzas, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I think we'll see a lot of zombies thanks to the Walking Dead, and I'm sure that the Daft Punk group-style cosmonauts will fall into our Instagram tapes this year.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are zombies, Batmans, pirates and witches.
Please, there's nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We ordered our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we were not the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Federation of Diverging Trade, Americans will spend $330 million on pet costumes this year.
That means a lot of funny dog dogs.
When it comes to confiscating, we don't hesitate.
The Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
It's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolate, ice cream, Milk Duds Confectionery, Twizzlers Confectionery and Clark Bar Batons.
According to the U.S. Ministry of Commerce, this is an excellent news for 41 million demanding confests of children who have prepared to subjugate our areas.
Moreover, we will buy and, if we do not deceive ourselves, sell 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing that we don't want to use is the confectionery in the form of corn grains; yet, according to the National Confectioner Association, almost 35 million pounds are sold under Halloween.
It's about 9 billion individual corn grains.
It's a mystery I still have to think about.
There's nothing like Halloween, like a house with ghosts.
They have amazing names, such as “Hour behind the walls” (which, for example, is in this prison), “Wood and scream” and “The House of Shock”.
In addition, according to the American community, there are 1200 officially recognized homes that generate about $500 million of income, as well as those amazing photos where you've almost described that your friend posted on Facebook, and you can't get rid of, and then the guy you like sees this picture and leaves a comment like a “classic expression of person”.
And finally, we'll talk about the guys.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Ticwa when we were kids, and the cutting off of Jack's lighthouse is like the beauty of a Christmas tree, what we do from childhood.
Luckily for us, the fashion of the baby started only last year with Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting these things, not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Population Census Bureau, this year the Americans will spend about $106 million in cash.
Jack's lighthouse, slowly rising on your wing, probably came from Illinois, which grew 542 million pounds this year.
If you want to do something more difficult, call Tim and Susan Mattisdon in the city of Napa, California, and try to cut some of their weight by 2032 pounds.
Estonia's Mine Defence Site Re-established After the Attack of Ukrainian Hackers
The website of the Ministry of Defence of Estonia is restored after the morning of cyberattack, reports the press service of the department.
According to the Vice-Chairman of Minowan on Information and Administrative Affairs, timer Peterkop was a primitive attack, and the site was simply overloaded by a large number of requests.
Our specialists have quickly made up, the site has been restored to date.
"The damage caused to the Ministry is minimal," Petercop told Postimees.
According to Petercope, it was early on that he spoke about who organized the attacks.
"We must examine the causes of the incident and draw our conclusions, but it is totally impossible to prevent such incidents," he admitted.
In addition, on 1 November, the Anonymous Ukraine set up a network that confirmed the hacker attack on the Republic of Estonia website and opposed Ukraine and NATO partnerships.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We don't have to be NATO servants.
Ukraine does not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine doesn't need NATO block.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine doesn't need Russia either.
Ukraine must not be a slave.
We are in favour of independent Ukraine.
"Hands other than Ukraine," says Anonymous.
Formerly, the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine reported that the mouth of the Feodosian separate battalion of the Ukrainian Navy will participate in NATO's command-step studies of the NATO Steadfast Jazz-2013 response forces.
Several schools and hospitals had to be closed because of the violence
Four schools in the Zimbabwen province of South Matabeleland had to be closed because the students were attacked... by goblins.
As the local elder said, the children panicked, and it was impossible to continue.
The story of goblins may sound like a child's invention for a European, but in Africa this is a very serious argument for closing school.
Adults are also afraid of unclean power.
In the summer, for example, the hospital in Zimbabwe was closed because the hospital was also attacked by goblins.
Announced Land Rover Gnoble Series
Inside there are hooves and six-dimensional safety belts, as well as the internal communication system.
Modernized brakes, a package of services that provides access to Bowler Works machines, logistical support and car storage between activities can also be obtained.
Dr. Bowler, director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The participants in the Bowler rally have changed.”
Some of them are not experienced hunters, but people seeking excitement, adventures and access to world-class activities.
We are pleased to propose such a path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that this format offers a new way to try various disciplines of the UK and abroad, as well as to prepare participants to the difficult conditions and realities of the Rally-Rail.
We were delighted to develop the Defender Challenge car — it would be a really exciting championship.
Defender Challenge also provides for one day in February for training and testing, as well as for participation in desert activities in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian forces don't know anything about the "Bratian Circle" grouping - New Reports
This is written by INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement authorities of the RF.
"After media reports of the introduction of Leps by the US Ministry of Finance into the suspect checklists belonging to the Eurasian criminal union 'Bratian Circle ' have been made available, we have looked at all databases, but we have not found such a grouping," said the interviewer.
In his view, the dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which is probably operating abroad.
As mentioned earlier, yesterday, the United States Ministry of Finance published on its website a list of alleged members of the Bratsky crime group.
Among them was the Russian singer Gregory Leps.
He's listed as "Birth" and he's posted in advance.
They match the data of the popular Russian executive.
The exact name is Grigorio Lepsevredze, the creative pseudonym, the place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, there are five other people mentioned there.
Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another exit from the former USSR, whose nationality is not indicated.
The United States is convinced that Gregorio Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket, carried money for gangs on their orders.
This communication includes photographs of the singer and all of his data that correspond to the facts.
Moreover, Leps actually recently bought a house on Phukete.
The department noted that they intended to impose sanctions on Leps.
The introduction of a person to the American Minfin blacklist has led to the blocking of his assets in the United States and a ban on business contacts with individuals living in the United States.
Assistant Leps Maya Serikov stated that no notifications to the singer had been received: "It is difficult to answer the question whether it is the Grigory that everyone is talking about now in connection with the scandal in the United States."
All Leps knows is the media.
He had no personal information, although I do not know whether they existed in such cases.
"And, of course, that's all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other -- amazing and unexpected," she said to RIA News.
According to her, Phukette Grigory Leps does not live, but, according to Minfin, he has a home on the Thai island.
She said that Leps was now on a long tour to the Far East and Siberia, and that the news had left him at the time of his transfer to Blagovesk.
He's out on the field at the "Shinnik" game.
Some details have been made known about the identity of the fanatic who escaped in the field during the match 1/16 ended the Russian Cuba between the Yaroslav "Skinnik" and the Moscow "Spartak".
According to the Head of the CDC, Artur Grigoryanz, referring to the MDDs, the patient is a mosque.
He's under arrest right now.
"That's why the Grigoryanz told us how the fan was able to break into the field: "It's clear that this one, called the viewer, was soon helped to accompany two viewers, referring to the problems of the heart.
He came to help us soon - this was confirmed by a doctor soon.
Then he thrust out two companions and fled to the field.
He fled from the corner of the East and the South to the corner of the East and North.
He ran all over the field.
That's what the stewards are responsible for.
Before the entry into force of the sport law, this is the area of action of the drivers - the police cannot interfere with what is on the field.
He got to the court, passed through the East Court.
At that time, riots began at the Eastern Tribunal and on the runaway roads," the head of the CDC said.
Recall that with the decision of the CD, the Moscow Spartak will carry out the upcoming 15th round of the Russian Championship against Locomotiva and Zenita without vision, and will pay a fine of 600 thousand rubles.
Fire teams were called upon to rescue the lost pig, who stuck 50 feet above ground for a dangerous career.
Koker-Spanish Ruby escaped after falling into a small DTP
Three days later, she got stuck in her career and noticed a man walking a dog.
The firemen went down on a rope on a hanging bow to save the dog from the imminent death
He was lucky to be rescued after the fires were fired to pick him up and deliver him to a safe place, after he somehow stopped at a height of 50 feet on a dangerous slope.
Nine-month-old Koker-Rubby escaped after she got into a car accident on Sunday, and spent three days alone before she was rescued from her career on Wednesday.
Her landlord, 25-year-old Scott Alderson, and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were in Fleppitt's career in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to join Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire fire department.
They looked for their missing dog and placed treatment on social media sites after she got away from her career after a small accident.
At about 14:15 in the middle of the night, the star dogfight noticed Ruby, standing at a height of 50 feet in a career.
A technical rescue unit from the Klekhito fire station rushed to the scene, landed on the ropes to save Ruby, and used the conveyance to lift it up the slope.
Andy Clayton, a rescue officer, said, “She was in danger.”
It was right in the middle of the hanging pit — 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move, and she didn't move a muscle when she was saving, she totally stood up.
But now she's fine.
Then she ate the stove.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was noticed is incredible.
The rescue officer Peter Lau said, "Ruby's been very lucky to have saved her."
It was likely that she could have suffered a very serious injury or worse.
The rubies were brought to the vet for inspection, and it was found that everything was fine with it, except for decommissioning and decommissioning.
Mrs. Hall of Galifaxa, West Yorkshire, said, “Observing salvation was terrible”.
I couldn't believe she was there at all.
It was amazing when she came back in our hands.
The vet said that if she hung up and lost consciousness, she would probably fall.
The fires were magnificent.
It was very brave — what they did.
We are so grateful, and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson from Kitley added, "We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there."
The fires were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't play with Katie Perry when she was 18.
During an interview with the Australian radio show this week, the pop star stated that she was a vocalist for Jagger's 2004 song Old Habits Die Hard.
Perry said she had dinner with a veteran rocker, and she said, “He was playing with me when I was 18.”
She added, "That was a long time ago, and he was very good."
In a statement on Thursday, a seven-year-old representative of Jagger said that he “categorically denied that he had ever given up on Katie Perry.”
The representative added, "It may be she's driving him away with someone else."
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests at the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism debuted in the first place this week.
George Kerewan: Breaking Europe Gives Scotland a Choice
One more day, another fear of independence.
This time we are warned that independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European area of free movement as a condition of EU membership.
There's a series of stories about passport control in Bervik and the border with a nozzle along Adrianov wal.
True, Strathclyde pointed out the potential economic benefits of more freer movement across the rest of Europe, although, as predicted, this did not appear in the headlines.
No one has indicated that EU Member States are spending a lot of time reversing their formal rules as they find it convenient.
Since Scotland is not now part of the Schengen area, the continuation of non-compliance will be a cost-effective substitute for Brussels instead of what it really wanted from the Scottishs.
So it's not worth the attention of history.
And so old that she turned into a rock: for the first time, I heard the “outbreak” that “independence means passport control” at least 40 years ago.
And yet there's an interesting moment lost in telling the old story.
Why should Scotland, an independent one, comply with Europe's orders?
Why change London's Yard to Brussels, especially now?
This is the current European news: a major post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stopped.
With the European crisis, the European project is officially dead.
All over the European Union, the anti-EU or euro-denominated parties are gaining power.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptics 'Alternaty for Germany' party, founded only this year, came out of nowhere and received nearly five million votes in the September federal elections, thus essentially exonerating the 'Free Democrats' (like our 'Liberal Democrats') from Budapest.
There has always been an internal opposition to the federal plan for Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
The harsh economic measures introduced by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the environment imposed on national economies by maintaining a single currency have led many people to believe that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments working with excessive budget deficits, which was only fair for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members at exchange rates that benefit German exporters, which are German policies and want to preserve.
Without the possibility of devaluing the national currency, South Europe is facing an unprecedented disadvantage in production opportunities compared with Germany.
The only means of saving is to cut salaries and public expenditures, which is actively supported by Berlin.
The current budgetary and monetary problems are the deeper problem of Europe's productive capacities.
As a result of the "green" energy package implemented by Brussels, the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than for the US.
It's a paralyzing price conditions, as we've already seen in Greenjmute.
No freezes of wages in the world will stop the collapse of the US's cheap salt gas over the European oil industry.
As a result, the rebellion, especially in France, is once the most fierce supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU a way to control Germany and put Paris at one level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of obtaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the damaged economy of France in a dire situation.
The result is the rights against the EU party Marin Le Pen, the National Front, just won the decisive additional elections by dropping the ruling socialist party to third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent votes, a timely warning to the British Laborists that there is no reason to assume that the division between the right will automatically be in favour of the left.
What does Le Pen do with his newly acquired popularity among the French white working class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If — and this is very likely — the EU party will receive support in these elections, such a block will be able to take the dominant position in the European Parliament for the first time.
This is my opinion: the rapidly growing attitudes against the EU and against the single currency in Europe are growing together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will once again become something of an inflated “Europe (the sovereign nations)” that liked General de Goll.
Germany and several economies can preserve the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I assume that Britain is away from this project, hoping to get closer to the United States.
Nevertheless, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain will remain unattainable in the Atlantic cold.
How does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (in fact) of Little England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed in a more open European agreement, provided we preserve our currency.
Cooperation with other single countries will be simple in the non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating the experience of Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The Government of the Scottish National Party in Scotland is, however, the most successful political movement in Europe against harsh economic measures, which had received an impressive majority in 2011 due to objections to reductions in the costs proposed (and implemented) by the Labour Office of Alister Darling and subsequently by the Coalition of the provinces and Liberal Democrats.
Scotland would not be able to vote for independence at the moment only to take action against the harsh economies imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early sex conception: early aging
African American and Latin American girls usually reach sexual maturity earlier than their white peaks, showing research.
Physical changes do not mean that sexual growth is close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the early sexual recovery mechanisms
Trends in early sexual maturity are not so pronounced in boys
Former co-rapporteur CNN Pet Et Eterj is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be afraid if her daughter begins to develop the onset of breast iron and grows her skull hair at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida, a child endocrineologist Dr. Paul Kaplovic explained that these early physical changes were quite common among American girls and constituted a new rule.
“I spend a lot of time calming my parents — this usually doesn’t mean a rapid onset of sexual maturity,” said Caplovitz.
The obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, skulls, and mucous membranes, and the smell of the body, appear earlier in girls.
But there was only a small shift in menarche age (first period) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years and falls from 12.75 in 1970.
“After the breast begins to develop, it takes at least two to three years to menarche,” said Caplovitz, who is also the author of the book “Raining Sex in Girls: How to cope with this widespread problem”.
Time is the most accurate examination of how sexual growth will progress.
A discussion was held that it was the actual onset of sexual maturity, but it was considered “preliminary” when breast growth was accompanied by a sharp increase of up to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or slow down, which is what a pediatrician can monitor carefully.
More rapid progress can be a basis for analysis of endocrinologist to eliminate serious problems, such as swelling or cough.
There are procedures to retain early menstrual periods and to prevent another consequence: premature bone aging, which can eventually slow down growth and slow growth in mature age.
The recommendations for medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the level of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychiatric aspects are also important.
The caplovitz is careful with medications, but recognizes that “prejudice can ease the behavioral problems and the feeling of girls that they are different from the vertebrates”.
Another major problem is that parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or even about how they deal with hygiene issues,” Caplovitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughter had a period of 10 years.
Although there were signs and we were talking about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first of her friends.
There are a lot of advertising theories about the causes of early sexual mutilation.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foodstuffs, chemicals in the environment or sexual media are guilty.
For boys, as for girls, sexual intercourse occurs earlier.
Capowitz argues that the most important requirement is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped to conduct a study of girls aged 6 to 9, which linked the amount of giraffe in the body to periods of sexual growth.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In that country, African American and Latin American girls usually reach sexual maturity earlier than their white capillaries.
There are different explanations.
Throughout the world, premarital sex seems to have an impact on everything, from economic conditions and climate to genes.
A further mystery: Although boys have hair on their face and on their skulls at younger age, the trend towards early sexual upheaval is not the same as that of girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of this topic.
The appearance of the next and the lobe hair even occurs in infants and children of childbearing age.
“We must be careful about how we determine the true onset of sexual maturity,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, child endocrinologist at the Gorieb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from the pediatrician about how to talk to their child.
“This may mean sooner than expected, conversation,” said Kaplovitz.
If you keep calm, your child usually reacts well.
Girls who grow early need to confirm that even when this is done earlier, this process is a normal part of life.
In China, American Boeing is preparing for departure.
An open-air aircraft flying over the territory of Russia and landing an unplanned aircraft in Chita on Friday, 1 November, at 8:30 p.m., will leave the city at Moscow time.
The airport's management allowed the ship to fly, getting the fuel money.
As reported at the airport, the plane will fly to Ulan-Ude.
According to other data, he will be sent to the United States.
It has been reported that a plane flying in Ulan-Ude landed in the Zabaykali country because of a fog.
He was not released from Chita airport due to unpaid bills.
There are 30 people on board, including the crew, who spent two nights at the airport, reports ITAR-TASS.
As reported in the IDF, under the terms of the Open Sky Treaty, people on board the aircraft are not entitled to leave the Chita airport, they can only pass border control at two Russian airports in Cuba and Ulan-Ude.
The Open Sky Treaty was signed in 1992, with 34 States participating in it.
Monitoring flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, Europe.
The Treaty ' s main objectives are the development of transparency, the monitoring of arms control agreements, the empowerment of crisis prevention and crisis resolution in the OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do I.K.M.'s late flags earn in the United States
The ranking of living celebrities with the highest income in 2013 led Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But it was the late Michael Jackson, whose death income from October 2012 to October 2013 was 160 million.
It is notable that others who have left their mark have been "worked" several times less than last year.
The second was in the list of the most “stately” missing celebrities, produced by the Forbes magazine following the year, Elvis Presley was 55 million per year, and the author of the comics by Peanuts Charles Schultz with 37 million.
In addition, Elizabeth Taylor, the former leader (25 million) and musician Bob Marley (18 million) came in the first five.
Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon, and Albert Einstein were also listed.
In Moscow, Igori Gujaev's first bottle was opened.
On 23 October, the first flagship bottle was opened in Igor Gulaeva, Moscow.
Designer Igori Gulaev is famous for its magnificent luxury mecha products.
And now they'll be able to appreciate even more fashion fans - in Moscow, his first bottle was finally opened, so the designer and set up a dolce vita-style party.
I'm sure the most beautiful girls live in Russia.
That's why I'm particularly glad I got a store in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there's really a part of me.
That's exactly what Igori said, he cut the red tape and invited all those who wanted to... to imitate the models he looked at!
Manufacturers of reactive aeroplanes are hostile to the width of the seat when large orders are placed on the horse
There was a heated dispute among the leading aircraft manufacturers about the width of the tourist class on the long-distance voyages, setting a tone for a severe confrontation at the Dubai Aviation Exhibition this month.
The range of seats provided on the long-stay journeys to economic passengers whose interests are not always at the heart of the airlines, while the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in the allegations of the effectiveness of the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for the introduction of an industry standard that would have a width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the economy salons, but its main American competitor Boeing said it had to be decided by the airlines.
The slowdown takes place when aircraft manufacturers compete in the sale of more and more versions of their two-engine remote master aircraft, and during the events of 17-21 November, potentially record orders are expected.
The composition of the rear part of the aircraft, especially if 9 or 10 persons are seated in a row, is central to the economic performance of the new mini-aerobus projects.
Boeing argues that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on seats in the economic class of more than 17 inches in width of 10 in each row.
Airbus said that the competing version of its A350 would transport 350 people in the economy to seats of 18 inches wide, 9 in a row.
Aircraft construction giants are often exchanged by a press ad on technical issues.
And now Airbus is addressing the public directly before the Dubai airline, where 777X is expected to be a leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what could be the beginning of a new advertising war by showing the financiers a slide depicting three people in a restaurant invited to each other, entitled “Would you agree to that?”
“Boeing offers remote master flights in lower seats than in regional turbo-vine aircraft,” said the sales manager Airbus John Lihi.
With a change in diet, people take weight, but aircraft seats have not changed dramatically.
By the early 1970s, by the time Boeing 747 had set standards for modern distant travel, and the average American male age from 40 to 49 years abroad had increased by 10 per cent, according to the United States Department of Health.
The size of the 21st-century U.S. average man is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus argues that its competitor adheres to the concept of the 1950s seats, when the average coverage of those who have recently been referred to as “reactive audience” has already been.
Airbus said it had ordered a study demonstrating that an additional inch in the width of the seat would improve the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing contests Airbus figures by size of seats and says that manufacturers should not be involved in deciding how airlines find a balance between tariffs and amenities.
According to her research, the comfort of the living room depends not only on the width of the seat.
“Everything is really about providing airlines with choices and opportunities to do what they think they should do to achieve success,” said expert Boeing at Kent Craver salons.
They don't want us to decide for them what will bring them income.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the issue is to increase the space on the side, but for suppliers it is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect income.
This dispute is worth a race for aircraft orders estimated at at least $700 billion at catalogue prices in the coming decades — enough to change the ratio of American and European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, the presence of seats is what exacerbates competition in the fight between new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 per cent increase in profits per slot in their last two-engine long-term models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-local Boeing 777-300ER.
The Boeing characteristics are partly based on the comparison of the 10-place lines of 777X with the original 9-place composition of the 777 series of constructive decisions.
Winning in a separate cost is reduced compared to the current ten-place composition.
"The reason Boeing does this is to push more places and make his plane more competitive than ours," said Kevin Kenston, head of the Airbus Passengers' Comfort Division in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that lounges with a complete 10-seat range for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a flat landing that can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
“The seat of a width of eighteen inches would be ideal for passengers, but the reality that the Airbus proposal is commercially a threat from the 777th model,” said a specialist on the Mary Kirby salon, founder and editor Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide chairs, but offer a supplier catalogue from which airlines can choose.
Air carriers traveling around the world are even driving their roulettes to check competitive planning.
In the light of the comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very flat cabin layout for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10 local lines, but says it hasn't sold it yet.
Airbus has recently emphasized the need for additional salons modifications, offering more space for passage on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say, its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to “flight” but may draw attention to the wave of sales of model 777X.
A new anticoagulant vaccine can eliminate the process of smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an anticoagulant vaccine that could eliminate cigarette smoking.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mouse from nicotine dependence for life.
Further tests are needed prior to the start of human trials, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Kristall of the Medical College of Wales Cornell in New York said the first results were encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, testing all the methods available on the market today, but found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with these modern means,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been developed to carry genetic information for the production of antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the cells of the liver, which then begin to produce a stable antibody flow.
Antithelials detect any nicotine molecules in the blood by neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the chicken from getting a nicotinic impact.
In the tests, vaccinated mice, which were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activity.
And the mice, which were not given the vaccine, were “slowed down”, and this is a sign that nothing came to their brains,” the researchers say.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines were unsuccessful because they contained antibodies.
To maintain a high level of antibodies, it was necessary to do so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the value of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it converts the cells to the antibodies factory.
Professor Kristall said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they would have a desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it's more likely to be used by smokers to quit smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not be pleased with this because of the nicotinic vaccine, and this can help them get rid of this habit,” he said.
British scientists said that the results were interesting but warned that further research was needed.
Oleiniks: the third rural settlements of Sub-Moscow
Vice-Governor Sub-Moscian Yury Oleinik said that almost three thirds of the village settlements in the Moscow area were entirely complementary
Total contributions from the region's budget are 187 settlements out of 288.
In 2013, 187 settlements from 288 received grants from the regional budget.
The total amount of grants in the income of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50 per cent and 83 per cent of the total.
Approximately 25 billion rubles are sent from the area budget," Oleinik said.
The Vice-Governor also noted that only three urban settlements -- Mettišt, Odinzov and Puškino -- amounted to more than 1 billion rubles in 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million rubles, "that's not enough."
The cost of maintaining a local administrative unit in 88 settlements in Podsovskia is over 70 per cent, “and the quality of services is reduced,” Olejnik said.
Earlier, he had instructed the heads of municipal education in Podmovski by the end of November to consider which settlements needed to be grouped, grouped in urban districts or a change in the administrative system.
These proposals will be drawn up by the end of January.
Formerly, the Governor of the Moscow Region stated that under administrative reform in Podsovskia it was planned to reduce the number of additional rural settlements.
Also in Mojaysk, Kashir, Sunshinekirsk, Colomen, Lüberc and Kotelnikh there is a demand for a population of municipalities.
This issue will begin in November in the cities and regions of the region.
The President of Mozambique, Igor Brennanalov, also said that, in the context of the ongoing reform, there were about 30 rural settlements in 12 areas of Sub-Moscow.
This is related to the fact that of the 178 rural settlements in Sub-Mosque, fewer thirds have a “acceptable” financial base and 100 are additional.
Diana Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not hide what great pleasure she gets from raising her children.
Although Arbenina now spends a great deal of time on creativity and public activities, she still finds the opportunity to drive with Martha and Artem, and not only spends time on their training, but also enjoys as much as possible.
In the last week, Diane twice reported to her worshipers about her pedagogical talents.
She first posted a photo in Facebook that shows how she teaches children to read.
And yesterday, she was talking to the fans, showing how she ordered Arthur and Martha to Halloween.
Our first Halloween," Diana called a picture of her children dressed in Christmas costumes.
What's not wise is that they, like any other Russian boys and girls, are related to this holiday because they were born in America.
Germany's first in Europe introduces an "undefined gender" when registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to be allowed to register children born with fermaphrodite instead of male or female to indicate “unspecified”.
The child's parents will have the right to leave the "pol" graph in the birth certificate.
Instead of "F" (female gender) or "M" (male gender) parents may write "X" (unspecified).
This decision is aimed at preventing parents from being pushed into an emergency with a sex-extinguishing operation.
According to statistics, one of the 2,000 newborns in the world is born with a hermaphrodite.
Tripods deny that they are under the influence of Obeda
The former Minister of Labour of New South Wales Joe Tripody will be a figure in the investigation of the State ' s anti-corruption supervisory body.
The former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Tripody, objected to the introduction of changes in the rental of marine objects at the request of his political teacher, Eddie Ooyd, secretly owned by three state-owned properties.
On Friday, the Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Oaed had lobbyed several state ministers for the extension of the lease to Serkular Ki, where the Oaed family had two restaurants and coffee, without passing the tender after their deadline in August 2005.
She was now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripody knew the secret of Mr. Oeida ' s participation in real estate facilities, following evidence given by the former Deputy Head of the Administration of Mr. Tripody Lynn Espoulé on Thursday.
During several years of discussions started in 2005, the Government insisted that the rent be displayed in an open competition.
The tenants objected, as well as wanted longer rental time.
In 2009, contracts for leases to Serkullar Ki, which brought the Owayd family about $2.5 million a year, were extended without an exhibition at the open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Ooyd, who, as Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, urged changes to the Government ' s rental policy.
In August and September 2007, IAC received talks between Mr. Ooed, Mr. Tripod and Mr. Steve Dan, senior officer who came to the Ministry of Ports after Mr. Ooed's work in the Fisheries Division.
“Was there a question that was discussed during these telephone conversations on the development of commercial rental policies?” asked Commissioner Anthony Willie, Assistant Commissioner Tripodi.
"No," said Mr. Tripody.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn't.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Ooiden.
According to the high-ranking official, Israeli military aircraft are attacking targets within Syria
The high-ranking official of the Administration in Fox News interviewed confirmed that Israeli military aircraft hit the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The officer didn't say it was a goal, but he said it was at least one.
Associated Press reports that the purpose of the Russian production was SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel carried aircraft on cargo with rockets inside Syria.
Foreign workers under sub-class 457 may be tested for “defence”
The “endurance” test for foreign workers in Class 457 visas is under consideration by the Government, as it intends to increase the number of repressive measures.
This test, if adopted, will be applied on the basis of the criteria for preventing the use of a Class 457 visa to fill unqualified posts or as a laity for moving family and friends to Australia.
The document submitted by the Government for discussion was published today, while former Labour MP Maxine Machu criticised the Government ' s rhetoric about foreign workers, said it could harm Australia ' s neighbours.
“The huge statements of "foreigners - at the end of the line" and "at the beginning of Australian work" are a very unpleasant response to the times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Australia-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white work had to be protected — and if some in the region had seen the results of this historic artifact, I would not be surprised.
The document submitted for discussion sets out 12 measures previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday in Sri Lanka, where he met with officials on human trafficking, has already made five of the recommended changes and the others are in the process of consideration.
If the “endurance” criteria are adopted, the visa applicant may be examined as to “if there is a true candidate in a condition where the candidate is a relative or a close friend of the owner or a person having an interest in the financing of the enterprise”.
Enterprises may also be required to report on the number of holders of visas under heading 457, as enterprises that were previously intended to sponsor a small number of workers were then employed by hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan seeking asylum died allegedly from a heart attack after arriving on a boat with refugees on the island of Christmas this week.
The man’s nine-year-old son was escorted to Australia by the wounded man, and since his father’s death on Wednesday, he has been supported by a twin brother who was also on board the ship.
The Australian authorities rushed the man to the hospital on the island of Christmas, where he died.
Comrade Semen Varlamova stated that a hockey player suffers from alcoholism
His friend, Semen Varlamov, Evgenia Vavrinuk, said that he was suffering from alcoholism, transferred by the Russian Service of News.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking," said a woman in particular.
It is recalled that Vavrinuk has brought to court for the defeat of the Russian Golkypper Semen Varlamov, also a member of the Colorado Club.
According to her, the hockeyist ripped her off her hair, as well as beat her, after the attack, her hands, chest, life, and neck were damaged.
Varlamov himself came with a warrant to the Denver police and confessed to the beating, detailing what had happened.
He was arrested, but then released at $5,000.
The court did not restrict sportsmen in their country movements, but prohibited them from approaching Vavrinuk.
He was also threatened with imprisonment for up to 6 years for domestic violence.
The UK Government announced a study aimed at increasing the economic impact for Scotland on the HS2 project.
The HS2 project involves the opening of high-speed communications with Scotland and northern England, beginning the First Stage in 2026.
The Minister of Transport Baronessa Kramer noted that the project “United Kingdom”.
The Minister of Transport of Scotland, Keith Brown, said that he was “enormously” from the perspective of work on the plan with the British Government.
The first phase will be to build a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When the Second Stage is completed, the lines will be placed in Manchester and Lids.
In June, the Government revised the estimated value of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from £31.7 to £42.6 billion.
The UK Government, which negotiates with Transport Scotland, commissioned HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in the pass-by capacity of the railway and to reduce the length of travel to North England and Scotland.
This should include an opportunity to cross the way from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baronessa Kramer said: “Our goal of HS2 is to create a current national network that will make Britain and its city closer to each other.”
We are developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge.
Without it, we will face a crisis of ability in our rail network.
But it is also about the transport of cities with each other; throughout Britain, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will receive a better communication thanks to HS2.
Scotland's Secretary-General Alister Carmicle added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Kit Brown called on Mr. Carmicla to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed railway has every chance of bringing enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds Scotland’s economic weight to the general argument for the high-speed railway throughout the UK”.
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the British Government to consider options for the construction of high-speed railway in Scotland, the creation of benefits for all, and the continuation of the railway line of Glasgow, Edinburgh, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the results of the study with the British ministers next year and to taking joint action on the following steps.
Thorius is a new hope for nuclear energy?
Governments throughout the world continue to think about how to provide energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (where they are) has a negative impact on the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
Atomic energy is done without it or otherwise, but it leaves behind a lot of waste.
Scientists have recently drawn attention to the scene -- another radioactive element of the Mendelev system.
He is meeting around the world, and according to experts, his fragmentation does not leave waste that has to be kept for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia as long as it remains in force
Australian airlines will need to continue to exclude their plates and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite US mitigation measures related to the device.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has allowed American carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch video or play games on their devices during take-off and landings, provided they remain in the Flight State.
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are disappointed that they do not have access to their electronic books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering the decision required by American airlines to carry out a huge amount of work to meet new requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Office also noted that they were considering this statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight are still in operation in Australia.
“The safety management of civil aviation flights currently has no special rules governing the use of electronic devices in aeroplanes,” it said.
The issue is governed by rules that require air carriers to maintain safety at any time, and by passengers to comply with the safety rules reported to them by crew members.
Virgin, who had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Office the expansion of its entertainment system on board with Wi-Fi, was not against changes, but stated that it would follow the direction of the regulator.
“We would welcome the consideration by the Civil Aviation Safety Office of the issue of the authorisation of electronic devices, because we really think that this will improve the quality of customer service now that it (the wireless wireless entertainment system) is on our aircraft,” the press secretary said.
Qantas stated that he would abide by the rules currently in force.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we are not planning to change them soon,” she said.
The FAO decision applies to American airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly carefully examine the decision of the FAO and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their airport.
Carriers will have to prove that their aeroplanes have the sustainability of radio-mombs from mobile devices, as well as review of the benefits, training materials, hand-carrying standards and instructions for passengers.
“After the airline checks and confirms the mobility of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, easy electronic devices such as tablets, electronic books and smartphones at any height,” FAU said.
In rare cases, the crew will give passengers instructions to turn off their devices during landing.
In addition, according to the group's recommendation, heavier devices should be placed under seats or in upper baggage compartments during take-off and landing.
The head of Dagestan is heard in the grave of Cuba's notes of extremism
A football match between Anji and Cuba broke out in a political conflict between the authorities of the Krasnodar province and Dagestan after the patients had burned the Dagestan flag, and the Cuban gym sounded different.
The head of Dagestan Ramazan Abdulatip on Thursday invited the Republican parliamentarians to appeal to the court because the Krasnodar province's gym is allegedly calling for international diversity, in particular for the war with the "Bassurmans".
Take the Gym of the Krasnodar province, which was approved in 1995 in our time.
That's the same thing, and no one's doing it.
"Observing you here, as the mother of a relative, as the enemy, as we go to the Basurman, we go to the battle of death," said Abdullah President of Parliament, Hizri Shissaidov.
Putin won impunity for his friend Assad
And now it's news from the ocean, and it's Syria, where, as we know today, Israel hit Russian production missiles, which are reported to have been called Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled the important condition of destroying its chemical weapons by 1 November.
This was done in the framework of an agreement reached through Russia and the United States not to carry out a military operation to which they had entered into force this summer.
More detail on the weapon and what all this means to the Syrian President, our chief international correspondent, Richard Angel, will tell.
Washington said the Assad regime would be punished for that.
More than 1,400 peacekeepers, including hundreds of children, died in August of the poisoning gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal set up by a friend of Assad Vladimir Putin.
Syria will withdraw its chemical weapons from the middle of the next year.
And today is an important wave.
The Group of International Experts reported that Syria had brought out of the building the alleged chemical production factories.
A longer and more difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and its components.
We understand it's about a thousand tons.
Previously, Washington said that Assad's days were supposed to be.
I think Assad has to go.
The question is not whether this happens, but when it happens.
He's no longer a legit, and he has to leave.
But Assad remains.
And he feels even more confident.
His troops continued to use artillery, rockets and firearms.
Its opponents are spread out, and they are armed with evil.
His people are forced to leave their homes, many starving.
Some have to feed on leaves and baskets.
Many believe that Bashar Assad escaped the punishment for mass murder.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement called the success of diplomacy, sentenced the Inspectors to the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad itself impressed the man who was ready to cooperate.
Today in Washington, the US Ambassador to Syria has had to answer some simple questions.
When the child is starving, his mother is hardly easier than he was killed by chemical weapons.
Assad's holding.
And he's turning weapons into power.
President RF established a separate Ministry of Construction and CWC
Russian President Vladimir Putin created a new ministry that was responsible for the construction and construction of the GCC and proposed that his former governor of the Ivanov region, Mikhail Menu, be chaired in the personal meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Meem at a residence in Novo-Ogarrevo, and Menh did not refuse to take the lead in the new department.
The President of Russia's Press Secretary Dmitri Peskov explained that all construction and CCH functions are moving to the new Ministry from the region.
Mikhail Men - son of the famous Orthodox priest Alexander Manja, completed the Moscow Institute of Petroleum by the name of Gubkin.
Since 1995, his political career has begun - he has been elected in Moscow from the Sergiovo-Posada region, has been a member of the State Duma, the first Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of Moscow, and the Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of Moscow.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Mikhail Menh was the governor of the Ivanov region.
The owners of the lobby in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is experiencing difficulties
At the Bendemir shopping mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthhalinga places a gold bracelet, ring and chain to pay for his daughter's school education.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is put in there," says Mrs. Amirthhaling.
Although she earns S$3000 ($2400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, the demand in various parts of South-East Asia, where household debt is growing, is such that ValueMax, where she is carrying out her business, became the third lombardo registered at the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
The loan for jewelry is not just a quick way to get money (S$1300 in the case of Ms. Amirthhaling), but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In Singapore, it is usually estimated that an effective annual interest rate of 17 per cent is higher than 15.4 per cent proposed by the United Overseas Bank, a local creditor with a branch at the same mall.
However, slots have the advantage that they do not require credit checks or pay evidence and can issue credits faster than banks.
Thus, millions of people throughout the region are being lathered, as families feel pressured by the increase in the cost of living and the rapid growth in household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustainable growth followed by the global financial crisis, and the financial loans for free monetary and credit policies in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are being channelled into the lambarda to compensate for income reductions as their economies slow down.
This week, Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, indicated an increase in the family credit shoulder, mainly due to the increase in the mortgage, as a risk factor for the credit capacity of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia led the list of 80 per cent of GDP compared with 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely escaped technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing decrease in exports and a decrease in consumer demand.
“The view is that with rising prices in the middle and lower [income scales], people will look for ways to fill their income wherever they can,” says Sung Seng Wun, economist CIMB, Malaysian bank.
The record of high gold prices in the last two years has strengthened the speed with which people spend their personal belongings, as they use the opportunity to obtain money for their family decorations.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the items placed at 200 city-state lobbying sites are gold products.
People say, "The price for gold is good, let's put the gold chain on the granny and get it back in the next month."
In Thailand, the largest shipyard operator EasyMoney has seen an increase of up to 20 per cent in the number of clients using its offices in recent months.
Growth in a slender business such as ValueMax, the operator of the office in Bendemir and 15 others in Singapore, is planning to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where it has four shops, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Li Ching, Executive Director of ValueMax.
The company will finance an increase of 60 per cent of the S$66 million that were incurred this week as a result of the placement of shares on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some creditors were criticizing the fire because of high interest rates, Ms. Yeah said that the lambbard not only offered cheaper tariffs than other creditors, it also did not increase the debt directly.
“Clients are investing the items they already own, and the montization of personal assets does not increase the debt of households,” she says.
The loan is gaining increased public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secure funding.
And there are not only those categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation.
The rich people in Singapore also use ValueMax offices, laying gold pictures or Rolex hours, which can give up to 60 per cent of their purchases in cash.
We see clients from all walks of society.
“They include people who need short-term money for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses who need to cope with temporary cash difficulties,” says Ms. Jahah.
Sometimes they just need the money very quickly.
Today, not the number and status of existing medical institutions, but the quality of medical care provided, is important for the population.
The implementation of the Health Modernization of the Tull Region for 2011-2013 programme, the reorganization of our city's health facilities will create an optimal health care structure for the population, including gynecological diseases, pregnancy and childbirth.
Thus, after joining the gorilla, there was still a great opportunity to attract narrow specialists from the NGCB GHG to consult patients with various pathologies, carry out additional hospital-based surveys.
During the modernization programme, the logistic base of the home had been significantly improved, and modern equipment had been provided to meet world standards.
Over the years, around 8 million rubles have been allocated for the capital repair of premises, and 112 units of equipment have been purchased for 42 million rubles.
The most modern equipment has an intensive post for newborns.
The cell-Syver machine is used in the case of a cutting caesarean to collect blood from the operating wound and after a special treatment to return to her homeland by avoiding the transfusion of foreign blood.
Modern equipment is also equipped with a laboratory diagnostic office.
The women ' s consultation has an electronic register, and the introduction of electronic maps and patient history is planned in the near future.
The development of telemedicine provided an opportunity for consultation of gynecological patients, pregnant women, infants and newborns with field specialists.
Chechens beat and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
The natives of Chechnya were arrested by the French police on suspicion of serial assaults on prostitutes.
The investigation has been carried out since March of the current year.
Some 60 women complained about the action of the caucasians.
The gangs reportedly ordered a prostitute in one of the Strasbourg hotels, and then they were killed and robbed.
The gang leader was a 27-year-old Prefect of Chechnya.
The defender of Bavaria David Alabama became the best sportsman in Austria in 2013, reports the official Bundesliga website.
In this dispute, he preceded winter sports representatives who traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place was taken by the miner Marcel Hirschher, and the third one was taken on a sledge with Gregor Schlerenzauer's tramp.
In the past season, a 21-year-old Austrian Filipino-Nigerian had helped his team to win the League of Champions, Championships and Kubka Germany, as well as the UEFA Supercube.
Former wife Archavina is resting with actor Andrey Chad
An ex-citizen footballer of the Peter "Zenita" Andrey Arshavina Julia Baranovski is vacationing along with actor Andrey Chadow.
Julia is resting in Italy in the company of actress Anastasia of the Railway, her female figure Sergei Slavov, and actor Andrei Chadova.
The photos from the couple's shared walks are published in Instagram Anastasia Road.
It's not the first joint photograph of Andrea and Julia.
On 5 October, the Railway published a photo of a couple standing on the banks of the Finnish Gulf in Comarov.
In mid-October, the Zenita Habbek, Andrei Arshavin, admitted to living apart from his civil wife, Julia.
It is recalled that Julia Baranovski and Andrei Archavin have been together since 2003, with three children.
It has recently become known that Archawin meets with the ex-model Alice Kazmin.
The new friend Archavin was married to the top manager of the corporation.
Savings package $325 million for the health of Tasmania
The Federal Government insists that the $325 million relief package for Tasmania ' s weakened health system will be complemented by harsh conditions that guarantee that the Government will not waste its resources in vain.
The Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth was taking “faster measures” to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing of the island ' s population, the higher levels of chronic diseases and the system ' s limitations.
The funding decision was taken for four years after the Government ' s consultations with the independent deputy of Tasmania, Andrew Wilke.
"The Government has proposed a package of emergency rescue measures, which we believe will address the specific problems facing the state," Mrs. Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for a close-up to scheduled operations.
Another 2600 operations, including orthopaedic and cataract removal operations, will help to overcome delays.
There is also money for clinics that receive unannounced patients, in Hobart and Lonseston, to improve the quality of care after the station, training medical professionals, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic medical cards in local hospitals.
“These investments will be carried out by well-expressed physicians on how better to help the Tasmanian health system,” said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania should work in strict reporting and accountability.
The State will need to maintain the current funding levels in order to obtain the funds of the Commonwealth and to report on where it spends those additional funds on a monthly basis.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the state provides services as effectively and as effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilke said today that $325 million would not decide “if they were not followed by a genuine reform that would put the Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable footing”.
However, he commended the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, with which he first addressed the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal assistance package will significantly contribute to the conclusion of this state’s health system from a critical point of view,” said Mr. Wilke.
According to the Government, these additional sampling procedures compensate significantly for recent reductions.
But the federal opposition health representative, Peter Datton, believes that today's statement is “a decision similar to a lacoplastery”.
"The reason we're here is that the government of the state has wasted $430 million of the health system," he told ABC TV.
When the government spends almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million, it cannot be assumed that it is good news.
Mr. Datton asked Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The screenplay by Giom Niklu Romana Dani Didro can be praised with exceptional order and historical details, but it is also more difficult to understand than it should have been.
The film, which took place in France in the 1760s, tells the dark story of Susanna, a young aristocrat sent to the monastery of her family.
When she starts to rebel, she suffers extreme cruelty from the hands of a sadist and rebellious woman and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film will never go down before it becomes a reality or a sensation — and that is the whole problem.
Due to its severe festive nature, the narrative is likely to be a type test for the receiver and for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons, the Monitoring Group said
Syria destroyed the main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and gaseous ammunition, declared the international monitoring team on Thursday, while severe collisions were raging in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
The Syrian group of activists also stated on Thursday that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
Statement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made within one day
the deadline of 1 November, established by this organization based in The Hague, for Damascus to destroy or “make inoperable” all chemical weapons production and mechanisms to mix chemicals with the extraction of gaseous pollutants and fill them with ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in the ambitious schedule that aims to destroy all the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
Destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, the destruction of existing weapons and stockpiles still needs to be begun by Damascus.
The country is estimated to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including bitter gas and nerve paralytic gas.
This statement was made during a severe war in the city of Sapphira on Thursday, where, in the opinion of the experts, the chemical weapons plant and its storage site are listed by the Syrian Centre for the Protection of Human Rights, based in Britain.
The group of activists, who had been tracking the loss of a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6365 children.
On behalf of the Government, the group stated that 29,954 were members of the armed forces of President Bashar Assad, 18 678 were pro-government fighters and 187 were Lebanese fighters in Hezbollah.
Also among the victims, as stated in the statement, were 2202 military conquerors and about 5375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
According to a United Nations estimate of 25 July, 100,000 died in conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this figure has not been updated.
The conflict forced some 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's forces fought in Sapphira several weeks with rebels, many of whom were associated with Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that there were victims on both sides on Thursday, but did not bring any specific data.
The fights highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, driven by the time-consuming period of their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal, in the midst of the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, said that its team was “now pleased that it had examined and seen all the critical means of production and equipment for mixing/processing claimed by Syria to be destroyed”.
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned”.
Earlier this week, inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites claimed by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two security posts, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, OPCW stated that both sites were “prohibited and... objects of the chemical weapons programme contained therein” according to the Syrian declaration were moved to other reported sites that had been checked.
It was not immediately possible to determine whether the site in Sapphira had been one of two places that OPCW inspectors had not been able to visit.
Syria introduced a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
“I welcome the courage and courage that you have all demonstrated in carrying out the most complex mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said Ahmet Uzumji, Director General of the Monitoring Group, in a comment published by the WHO.
For the third year of civil war, the rebels, mainly Muslim Sunni, have been confronted with the Government of Assad and its security forces, which are members of its Alaivit sect, the response of Shiite Islam.
With regard to other events, the head of Rami Abdurrahman Centre said that there was a strong explosion on the environment at the PVO site in the coastal province of Latakia.
The reason the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger over the protests of the organizers of the attack in Bali
The remaining 202 survivors and relatives who were killed as a result of the bombing in Bali in 2002 were furiously responding to the sentence of the last of the defendants who had been brought before the court and stated that Omar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years in the run, as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in the creation of explosive devices used during the attack.
It may be released within 15 years if it is granted conditional release.
The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass killings as a result of an attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, during which 202 people, including 88 Australians, were killed and tens were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other charges related to terrorism, including the explosions of the churches throughout Indonesia in the Canon of Christmas in 2000.
The prosecutors demanded a lifetime, although they could insist that a person who was known as a “slipper” for his reputation as an explosive master should be sentenced to death.
This decision has exacerbated the painful memories of the mother of Perth Jun Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin and Jenny's twins in the Patek and his partners almost ten years ago.
She could hardly hold back her tears and said that Patek had to be sentenced to death.
“I really believe that he should follow the feet of other men.
He must appear before the firing squad," said Ms. Cortin AAP.
"I have to live every day, knowing that I will have no grandchildren anymore, and I will not see my daughters."
The Sarah Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was put into the parked outside of the van immediately after 11 a.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where a terrorist bomber exploded a rifle started by an explosion just 20 seconds earlier.
After that, he fell into a coma and died three times a month, being connected to the life insurance system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should divide the participation of three other members of the terrorist cell "Jemaa Islamia " responsible for the bloody war " , " Amroz, Muhlas and Imam Samudra " , who were punished four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty most of all.
Keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and hurting hundreds is not so much.
Patek is the last of the parties to the act in Bali before the court.
He hid for nearly ten years, but was finally detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US troops killed former Al-Qaeda leader Usam bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent showed that the findings showed that Patek had been in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in an attempt to restore relations between South-East Asia and Al-Qaida terrorist groups.
"He didn't give up," said Mrs. Cortin.
Until recently, he had not regretted how much he had done to others.
Sentences were made before the tenth anniversary of the act, to be observed later this year in Bali and Australia.
“This year there will be a lot of tears,” says Ms. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAU: Air passengers can now use boyfriends on aircraft (but not phoned)
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not talk on mobile phones, according to the long-term new guidelines published by the Fourth Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect changes to take place immediately.
As soon as such a change is made, it will vary depending on the airline, said FAO Administrator Michael Wert at the press conference.
The airlines will have to show FAU how their aircraft complies with the new guidelines and that they update their flight crew training manuals and system regulations to comply with the new guidelines.
FAU stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to increase the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that had already submitted plans.
“Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon,” FAU said.
Passengers are currently obliged to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door is closed.
They must not be relaunched until the aircraft reaches 10,000 feet and the captain will be “good”.
Passengers must turn off their devices again when the aeroplane is lowered for landing and not include them until the aircraft appears on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, aircraft whose aeroplanes are adequately protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and driving, FAU said.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Shipowners, welcomed these changes.
“After the new policy has been successfully implemented (and we are going to work in close contact with the carrier to achieve this), this will be an easy option,” Glading said.
We have stood firm for “school hours” when it comes to this issue.
But connection to the Internet for serfing, exchange of e-mails, text messages or loading of data would still be prohibited at a height of less than 10,000 feet, the Agency reported.
Passengers will be invited to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices into aircraft mode.
Thus, no “Words with Friends” is still an intellectual online game in which actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when the incident occurred: the actor was taken off the American Airlines aircraft for refusing to turn off the device when the plane was on landing.
And more heavy devices, such as laptops, will still have to be placed in a luggage office, as they can hurt someone if they fly all over the salon.
Phone calls in the field will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority on telephone calls belongs to the Federal Liaison Commission, not FAO.
FAU may withdraw the ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Safety Board, a national transport safety expert, CBS News, said that hundreds of phones were still at risk.
“The phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create gaps for navigation devices, but we know from FCS that they can create gaps for the top of the clock when the aircraft is in the air,” Rosenker said.
The Sectoral Advisory Committee, established by FAO to examine this issue, recommended last month that the Government permit the wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on FAO has increased to reduce restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Senator-Democrat of the state of Missory Claire McCaskil, claim that there are no major security reasons for bans.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult, as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAU began to limit the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to mixed communication and navigation equipment messages when passengers started carrying FM radio receivers, high-tech guys at the time.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than on previous generations of aircraft, but they are also developed and approved by FAU as sustainable for electronic interference.
The airlines have offered passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruise altitude for several years.
Aeroplanes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to displacement.
The vast majority of liners are adapted for the wider use of electronic devices in accordance with the new guidelines, Warta said.
Today ' s electronic devices usually emit radio signals far less powerful than previous generations of devices.
Electronic reading devices, for example, only emit minimum signals when browsing pages.
But signals become more powerful when devices load or send data.
Among those seeking to mitigate restrictions on the use of electronic devices was Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company's representatives loaded the entire aircraft with their electronic reading devices Kindle and flew on it to verify the existence of problems, but did not detect them.
The members of the FAO Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of devices presents any risk.
Douglas Kidd, of the National Air Passenger Association, said that he considered the confusion of the devices to be real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only separate pilot communications confirming that devices could create gaps for aviation systems, and most of them were very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAU allow pilots to require passengers to turn off devices during the installation of the device under limited visibility.
The tourism industry's group welcomed these changes, calling for them to be a healthy step for passengers who are now using a number of technological devices.
"We are pleased that FAU recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and protection," said Roger Dow, Director General of the U.S. Tourist Association.
Schools will be able to conduct examinations for driving rights
Exams on driving rights can be accepted by private companies with their own computerized motorway.
The Commissioner writes about this with reference to the draft Government ' s decision "On vehicle management " .
According to the newspaper, there are currently about 30 such cars in Russia.
Students of such "privileged" schools are expected to count the results of internal testing.
In doing so, the Gosavto inspection will monitor the submission of examinations every half a year.
If more than 30 per cent of the theoretical exams and more than 20 per cent of the students do not give up for the first time, such a school will be deprived of half-year privileges.
The technical requirements for motorways contained in the draft Government decision shall enter into force from 5 November 2014.
The project also contains requirements for two-wheel driving.
From 1 January 2015, the owners of motorcycles for category A rights will be required to submit an examination in the context of urban traffic.
Moreover, as of 5 May 2014, companies will not be able to employ foreign drivers with foreign rights.
Such workers will be required to receive Russian rights after the examination.
Birds flying through the air safely from a stormy plant in the North Sea, released back to wild nature
The bird, scattered by the sea after it was found in a depleted state at an oil elevation in the North Sea, was released back into the wild.
The watertight was placed in a helicopter sent to Aberdin last month and was then released by the Scottish Animal Abuse Prevention Society (SPCA) at the rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon's centre manager said: "This waterfall is probably a winter migrant from Northern Europe who fell into a strong wind zone over the North Sea."
It seems that the bird has suspended and was able to find shelter at an oil height.
He said, “She was unable to fly again; therefore she came to us for help.”
The watering was healthy and in good condition until it was released.
Is the elite of Europe ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with an obligation to bring together business representatives and to determine what changes British welfare and jobs makers want to see in their relations with the EU.
To this end, we have ordered the largest and most complete survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their views on Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, representing a large business in the United Kingdom by size, sector and region.
The results of the survey will prove to be unexpected for many.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking for export opportunities outside Europe, paying particular attention to the countries that are modernising and growing, while the EU countries are in a standstill.
They want the Government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than waste time on the long and difficult process of reforming EU institutions.
When asked about their views on specific political issues, from anti-monopoly regulation to product laws, most business leaders felt that the control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was a general dissatisfaction in the single market, with business representatives claiming that the costs of regulation from Brussels are now outweighing the benefits of finding a trade area in Europe, with even 40 per cent of the largest enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European of all companies.
The last and most obvious is our survey of business leaders found that the clear majority wants Britain to take a course on treaty change and relations with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This result, which was seen among businesses of all sizes and major business groups, shows that business is pushing for a “significant change” that will return to Britain.
The high rate is the achievement of treaty changes and more favourable conditions for Britain will ensure a 16 per cent vote in order to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British business supports its plan to review the terms of membership of the United Kingdom in the EU.
It also shows that the business expects the revision to lead to a significant shift in the current balance of forces back to the United Kingdom.
The better conditions for the British business can and will become increasingly necessary as the euro area enters the path of closer economic and financial union.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in Britain, and as the results of our survey show, this means a stronger focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels's regulatory activities.
United States Services Listen to the Pope’s Personal Phone
The work of the Vatican is under the supervision of American special services.
The new documents from the Edward Snowden collection show that the U.S. intelligence led to the hearing of all the negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and now he is thoroughly guarding Pope Francis.
His phone began to listen before he became the head of the Vatican.
The election process of the new pope was under observation.
That is why the United States was given special importance.
The special service was connected to hundreds of cardinals who had gathered in Rome to pick up a regular Pope.
The telephones of the residence were also heard where the conclaves lived.
The American spies listened to all the main applicants on the papal throne in order to prevent the appearance of a Washington figure.
The Panorama magazine says that the U.S. Great Ear continued to hold prelate talks until the very end of March 12th.
It is claimed that since 2005, the Argentine Archbishop of Bergolio has been awarded as the future Pope of Rome.
The American intelligence also held talks on the election of the new President of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine writes that in the United States Embassy, a secret group of operatives of the CIA and the ANB is continuing to work on policies and financial flows.
In turn, the Vatican has peacefully announced that it does not care about the American "stupid" even if it does.
There are no secrets from the U.S. government of the Holy Fathers.
Snowboardlists for the Olympic Cup specially photographed
The Bank of Russia issued an Wednesday note on Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held in this winter.
Nominal cups are 100 rubles.
But the bloggers' network is already actively ironicing about the memory note.
Following the presentation of the Olympic Cup on 30 October, they drew attention to the fact that the image of a banknote sub-boardist can be found in photobanks.
In particular, there is a free StockExchange photo store, where this photo is dated in 2005.
The same photograph is used in a Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website Megaobsor on 18 January 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in RugGear smartphones.
The Olympic Banknote is run in blue and blue gamma.
On the one hand, a snowboardist flying over Sochi, on the other hand, is a type of Olympic stadium and a Ghar-bird.
Author of the Design Banknote - Pavel Bushuev, who won a competition among the students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Art of Repina.
The presentation noted that several types of sport were considered, such as gorillas, fristils and tramplin beads, but eventually they selected a snowboard because it was a relatively young sport.
According to the source, near the CB, the regulator is not indifferent to the general public ' s view of the widespread dissemination of the image of the rebate from the Olympic banknote and is now studying the situation.
And that's not too much of a noise around the Olympic banknote in Gozaka.
Mr. Natalya Nikiforov, a press director, said that all plagiarism was ridiculous.
The snowboarder on the banknote will return to the right, the photos in the network - on the left - clarified Nikiforov.
The person in the photo session to create the computer was taken from different points, then a final image was selected, and it was a character outside the snowboard.
She also noted that copyright laws were not applicable to the Olympic banknote, since the artist had received salary for work.
In the opinion of the experts, the discussion of images on the Olympic Cup is positive.
The ability of the computer image - plus for its promotion - is considered by NP Executive Director RusBrend, Alexei Popovicev.
Evidence of the percentage of images on the computer and in photobanks is quite difficult, so the demand for intellectual property dispute on the image is unlikely.
The first Olympic banknotes appeared in China in 2008 to the Beijing Olympic Games.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Legal bans forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian brewers have a bad mood.
According to them, the consumption of beer in the country will remain at the former level in the future, and that is best.
Although businessmen were originally expected to grow.
The current year has failed them: sales fell by 7 per cent.
Both were led by the head of one of the largest brewing companies in the country, the chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian brewers Isaac Sheps at the 3rd annual conference of Adam Smith Institute of Daily Demand in Russia, which had just ended in Moscow.
It was discussed by the public regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already fallen by 18 per cent, as in recent years there has been a significant increase in the regulation of the beer industry in the production and circulation of low-alcoholic beverages, said Sheps.
No country in the world has such a strict restriction on the beer market, the unforeseeable introduction of all new and new illogical bans, which are based on the allegations of combating alcohol abuse.
The brewer noted that many legislative bans aimed at reducing alcohol abuse did not have a special impact, but all new initiatives were constantly under way.
The ban on the sale of alcohol in kiosks has been imposed on more than all beer producers since this year.
"We immediately lost 35,000 consumers," said Isaac Sheps.
For the next year, brewers have two forecasts.
Optimist is what Sheps said: sales of cold drinks are kept at the former level.
The pessimistic will drop by another 2-3 per cent.
In order to preserve their income, businessmen are forced to leave the classes that are expected to be the "premium": beer will become smaller, but it will be the road.
However, the radical consequences of the drop in sales with a small amount of alcohol have not yet been seen.
"As far as I'm concerned, the level of alcoholism remains at the same level," said Dr. Alexei Stotnik.
True, it has increased the proportion of patients who use strong drinks syrups, as well as those who "suck" on alcohol-containing tonic beverages like "Jaguara", while ten years ago it was the drinking alcoholism.
In September, 600 people were released from the Ford car plant in Universal.
As the trade unions say, all those fired were compensated.
However, where the problem of workers is more acute, there is a problem of reducing production in the region.
At the meeting, a deputy of the Zacksa Aleksey Etmanov said that about 600 people had been reduced in the Ford plant in Universality.
According to him, this happened again in September: at that time, about 600 people had left the factory in conjunction with the organization ' s trade union.
“Golden parachutes” were offered for a number of salaries by workers who decided to resign themselves.
As a result, the vast majority have left jobs on their own.
However, according to Etmanov, this number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think that's gonna limit the case.
However, the authorities for the next two years do not intend to adopt any programmes of support for the affected regional enterprises," he explained, adding that the Government did not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large reduction of jobs.
In Ford, this information is not contradicted or confirmed.
We expect a response from the company, and as soon as it appears, we will have to publish it.
Talks about reducing staff at Forda plant in Universal are going on a long time.
So, for example, the company's plans to release 600 people became known in September.
The plant had previously stated that the production of cars would be suspended.
As a reason for the plant, they called the fall of the Ford car in Russia.
According to Petrostat, after nine months 2013 industrial production in Lennoblastia decreased by 5.4%.
Vehicles and equipment production decreased by 11.5 per cent.
Mobiles can be used in the United States during take-off and landing
New rules for the safe use of mobile devices during take-off and landing have been approved in the United States, the BBC Telecommunication Corporation reports.
US airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the trip, and new rules will begin to work by the end of 2013.
However, communication with the Internet for receiving and sending e-mails will be prohibited during flights of less than 3 kilometres.
Because of the danger of interference with aircraft radio equipment, the voting connection will remain under ban.
Thus, air passengers will be allowed to read electronic books, play board games and other gadgets and watch video during internal and international transfers.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to verify the safety of the use of electronic devices during the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Administration that they are able to cope with the alleged impact of aircraft mobiles and aircraft controls.
According to the source, for example, the United States may also review current standards for the use of electronic devices in flight.
For the Russian Mafia in the United States, a new name was finally established - the Bratsky Circle.
This week, the black list of Russian Mafia in America was filled with new names and four companies.
The United States Ministry of Finance introduced three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli.
One of the Russians was a well-known singer, Gregory Leps, whose United States is suspected of transporting money to group members.
It is still in the US black list of 22 people involved in the "Bratian Circle " and six organizations affiliated with it.
However, many experts question the existence of such an organization.
"The proclamation of the "Bratian Circle" is more likely to unite the various criminal groups," said an expert on organized crime and professor at the University of New York Mark Galeotti.
In his view, "Bratian Circle" reflects the popular perception of "Russian Mafia".
"I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement agencies or anyone else who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization," quoted Mr. Galeotti, American Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Mr. Galeotti agreed with Professor George Mason Liz Shelly.
"If they work together, it is more like a criminal network, but not an organization," says the Centre for Research on Corruption and Organized Crime.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the "Bratian Circle" unites to a greater extent a Russian hero in Aslan Usoyan's law, known as Grandpa Hassan.
The criminal authority was murdered in January of this year.
Thus, the activities of Lashi Shushanashvili and Zechariah Kalashov, who completed the list in 2012, were closely related to Grandpa Hasan, and another participant in the list, Temuri Mirzoev, came to Grandpa Hasan as nephew.
However, Mr. Galeotti noted that some individuals were not related to Usoyan.
In his view, all of them were more closely united in financial and criminal interests, such as drug supply from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion in the "British Circle" by Gregory Leps, the favorite singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin, drew Kremlin's attention.
Of course, we expect more detailed information from our American partner colleagues, as a result of which such a decision was made, to be included in such lists, says the Press Secretary of the State of Dmitri Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the RF.
As well as the interests of all citizens of the FP, its interests will be protected.
Head of Gasprom Alexei Miller says the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas field
The start of the construction of the "South Stream" pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe," said Gazprom Head.
"Today there has been a significant event: the construction of the Bulgarian gas pipeline "South Stream", the largest and most important project in Europe," said President Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent.
The South Stream is intended to diversify Russia's export routes across Europe.
The dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which contains a large proportion of the Russian gas Europe, increases the risk to ordinary routes, officials say.
Miller stated that direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were “always”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the "South Stream" at a reduced price as soon as the whole project starts working in 2015.
Gasprom stated that construction should start in other countries further along the gas pipeline by the end of the year.
The annual project capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
This morning in the Sarat district, the driver of the Peugeot car went to the meeting area at 115 km along the road of Odessa-Rani, and met a bus with six people.
This is reported by the Office of the Office of the Management of HRSC in the Odes area.
As a result, a 31-year-old driver of the Peugeot car died.
A 55-year-old passenger and a 44-year-old bus driver was injured.
The doctors provided the woman with first medical attention on the ground, and she refused hospitalization.
Also, medical personnel soon surveyed all other passengers.
With the help of a crane, the rescuers lifted the bus and released the bus driver whose leg was claimed at the door of the bus.

Two YMCA officers were charged with sexual offences prior to charges against Jonathan Lord, as known by the Royal Commission
Two YMCA NSW staff members were charged with sexual offences against children prior to the 2011 charges against the childcare agency in Karingbache Jonathan Lord, reported to the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children.
But the Commission's introductory statement stated that it had “never dealt with cases of sexual violence against children within its organization”.
Chief Executive Director Philip Hayer was asked about one case where a YMCA employee was accused of child pornography offences, and on the other, when an instructor had sported YMCA Caringbah Hall for sexual crimes against children under his care in 1991.
Mr. Hayer said that Gail Ferness, a lawyer assisting the Commission, knew about the first case, but didn't know about the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA in the introductory speech for the Commission also allowed for inaccuracies, arguing that “the YMCA external checks were that YMCA was in the first line to ensure the safety of children”.
The evidence provided by the commissions suggests that YMCA was notified that it had received a second from four possible evaluations of the quality audit carried out by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hayer, who joined YMCA when he was 21, acknowledged that he and the lower leadership had let go by hiring Lords, and that staff had not been able to ensure a clear understanding of their obligations regarding reporting violations of the child ' s security policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual crimes against 12 boys for two years at YMCA.
He's been in prison for at least six years.
But Mr. Hayer rejected the assumption that the YMCA corporate ethics had prevented staff from reporting the violations of the Lord in the field of child security.
The officials testified that they had observed violations, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, personally behind them, putting them on his knees, saying that he loved one of them and allowed them to play with their cell phone.
Daniel Okwell, who was under the leadership of the Lord and asked to teach her child protection because she was concerned about his conduct, testified that Jacky Barnat, the guardian of the YMCA Children's Office in Caringbach, who was the head of the Lord, was “a frightened and often difficult look”.
The Executive Director said that he did not explain to staff that they had been reluctant to report the situation to their superior managers.
Rather, he said that their friendship with the Lord led them to think of the need to communicate about him.
Mr. Hayer said that he had presented to the YMCA Council of New South Wales his opinion that the lesson for the organization from the “accident with Jonathan Lord” was not “to provide information” by staff, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hayer said that the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the charges had been filed was adopted by the Director-General of YMCA on Child Care for Liam Whitley.
He said that it was intended to prevent a breach of evidence, but it was “resurrected” and this decision was badly realized.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not safe for children by the organization during her work, Jonathan Lord between 2009 and 2011, a commission of experts on the growth of children, Professor Steven Smallboon, at the University of Griffith.
He said there were “serious problems” in the recruitment, selection, instruction, training and monitoring of staff.
The hearings shall be postponed until 20 December.
A fashion week in San Paulo.
She's not just a model, she's a real star.
Even though Giselle Bundssen had for a while left her job as a mother during those days and this week's performance she came in special.
The lack of months did not prevent her from keeping her place on the podium and on the pedestals.
The living remains the highest-paid supermodel of the world.
This time she took part in the "Kolchchi" brand.
The final week of fashion is usually the most interesting shows.
It's kind of like a stylistic lino Villaventura.
For more than 30 years, in parallel with the production of a luxury pre-port, the model works actively in theatre and cinema, designing spectacles and making costumes for many famous paintings.
In general, more than 30,000 companies and companies that are related to the textile industry and the fashion world participated in the final week of the fashion in São Paulo.
This is one of the most dynamicly developing areas of production, which employs over 2 million Brazilians, with annual turnover of $50 billion.
Tony Blair said he was taking the chance to return as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but recognized that the return was unlikely.
Earlier this evening, in an interview on the fifth anniversary of his retirement, 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after ten years in the leadership position, Blair has avoided much of the discussion of British policy, limiting most of his comments on foreign affairs and his role as a ambassador to the quarter of the Middle East peacekeepers.
Responding to the question whether he would return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said, "Yes, of course, but it's hardly going to happen, so... "
The Master Coach of Milan, Massimiliano Allerry, expressed regret over the results of the 10th round of the Italian Championship with Lacio.
The specialist also noted that failure at the start was caused by a series of traumas of leading players.
I'm very sorry that we couldn't win, but Tmw's saying Allergy.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first time, we didn't let Lacio do anything.
In the second Roman, they added, but in general, I can't say that we've lost concentration.
We had to win.
In the past season, we had a mission to get to the League of Champions.
Now we're off the schedule, but this is due to the whole series of key football injuries.
Rammy and Honda?
It's a very good game, with a character.
But now we're good.
Take a look at Kak, who held a high-level meeting.
The experts from the competitions coming to Cardiff to fight for the prize of the Year knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready to show up for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months before he took his first step, this kid and his little Shetland Pony Toffi slid through three tours to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This undiminished couple — the same growth — received high grades for the appearance, behavior, and style of the annual competition held by the Sannibank horse sport centre in Radri near Cardiff.
When he went out to the public at the front of the men and women in finely dressed cats, he swung his hat and proudly held around the two-year-old Toffi.
The judges commended Fenton for his not yet having developed the innate capacity to treat the horses for years.
And Toffi received a high degree of externality and character.
Fenton was given to Toffi on his third birthday in March last year, and since then he has been dealing with Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fenton and Toffi are a great duate."
They had many rivals, but the two went out with a golden cup and a rosary.
It was just his second speech from Toffi, and we were all in a hurry when he won.
It was considered to be so phenomenal by unknown people in the arena that they wanted to take a photo with it.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, near Eb-Weil in South Wales, is walking on his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been exhibiting horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "The whole audience was struck, and everyone shouted for approval and applause."
He ran through the sand all along the arena, and although he looked so fragile, he did a wonderful job.
He loves horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two chickens he cares about.
As he started, he will be in the Los Angeles in a short time — and I am sure he will be doing well.
The representative of this annual horse show said: "The Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to address his ponies."
They're a great team, though.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffi for their appearance and how they presented themselves on the show.
They appreciate the agreement of the pony and the manufacturer, Fenton and Toffi, were the best in the ring.
I'm sure that Fenton helped him with his attractive outfit, he really looked good in his role.
Publishing a call from the Chinese newspaper “Reorganization”
The Chinese newspaper, which issued a first call for the release of the defendant in the reporter ' s cage, should be reorganized, the press regulator reported.
The New Express, published in Guangzhou, made an unexpected public statement requesting the release of journalist Chen Junzhou.
However, Mr. Chenh later admitted on television that he had taken bribes for writing false articles about a company with a public share of property.
Now, the New Expression must go through “the process of complete correction of errors”, as the regulator says.
The order for “error correction” came from the Guandun Office in the field of press and publications, radio, cinema and television.
The preliminary investigation showed that the Yangcheng Evening News Group published several false reports on the Zoomlion stock exchange between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The New Expression Editor’s manual was disoriented,” said the regulator’s statement.
He reported that the decision had been made to “use the administrative recovery of Chen Junjou in the form of a withdrawal of his reportary licence”.
He also “instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to correct all the errors in “New Expression” and recommended that it carry out an investigation into the situation of the newspaper’s leaders and immediately amend the “New Expression” guideline”.
Mr. Chenh wrote several articles for the New Express, which stated financial violations in the construction equipment of a company called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his newspaper published two appeals for his release on the first floor, claiming that he supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on public television, recognizing that he had published false money articles.
“In this case, I damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news industry and its ability to earn public confidence,” he told the public broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and glory.
I realized my fault.
After his confessions, Mr. Chenya “New Express” issued an apology for the first floor, stating that the paper was not able to properly verify his reports.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects were admitted on television.
Experts say that China's practice of recognizing recognition continues to be widespread, despite recent amendments to the laws prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to make a self-responsibility.
U.S. tunnel found - Mexico for drug processing equipped with its own railway
One of the most complex drug-trafficking tunnels between the United States and Mexico, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electric relay systems.
The U.S. authorities described the four-foot-foot tunnel as one of the most complex secret trails they've ever found.
This tunnel, which has a length of nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near the city of Tijuana (Mexico) and San Diego (USA).
This area is filled with unmarked warehouses, which facilitates the hidden cargo of drugs in the truck.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs had been permanently transferred through it, as the authorities said.
According to court documents, law enforcement confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in finding the tunnel.
Three men who, according to law enforcement, had been charged with the possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
In the event of conviction, they are threatened with imprisonment from 10 years before life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage in San Diego since 2006.
Several major tunnels were found in Central Mexico after the harvest of marijuana in October, which posed a difficult challenge for drug cartels to deliver their products quickly to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of some 700 yards, equipped with recreational routes, from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two San Diego warehouses.

British police hand over to Assanju a notice of extradition
The British police today issued a notice on the extradition of the founder WikiLeaks Julian Assang, who was hiding at the Embassy of Ecuador in London and sought asylum.
In Scotland, Yarde stated that they had handed the 40-year-old Australian an “official requirement to surrender” with a requirement to appear at the police station, adding that if this requirement was not met, he would continue to be arrested.
Assanju is threatened with extradition in Sweden on charges of sexual offences after he exhausted his capacity under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal for extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would transfer it to the United States, on 19 June he hid at the Embassy of Ecuador in London, requesting political asylum from that South American country.
Scotland-Yard “has given a 40-year-old official requirement to surrender, which obliges him to come to the police station on the day and time of our election”, the press secretary reported.
He continues to violate the conditions of release under bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the notification of the police.
Assang is afraid that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to make possible charges in spying after the publication of more than 250,000 US diplomats on the WikiLeaks website.
Driver speeding 130 miles per hour with hot drinking between his feet, fined £1000
The driver was charged £1000 for driving up to 130 miles an hour (110 km/h) with a hot drink held between his feet.
35-year-old Andrew Howy from Tiptri, Essex, was observed for his Mercedes Benz on the A120 track in Brendri on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink for him in the middle of the leg.
In the world court of Colchester Howy acknowledged the charge of driving without due care and attention.
The addition to his driving licence of seven fines resulted in a six-month driving ban.
Howi also committed to pay the cost of £90 and additional collection to assist victims of crime of £100.
Tax for foreign real estate owners will result in the London bubble collapse
The Treasury has carried out a preliminary assessment of the capital increase tax measures, but expects a final decision by Mr. Osborn, who in the 2012 budget imposed a public tax rate of 7 per cent for houses worth more than £2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to own houses in the company rather than as natural persons.
To date, housing in the Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea areas of 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 financial year already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, north-east, north-west, Yorkshire and Hamber.
Mr. Cook said: “After increasing the ownership of expensive houses and the introduction of related legislation against the removal of property, it is very difficult to claim that the taxation of expensive property is reduced regardless of the impact of the old municipal tax system.”
“But this may lead to some foreign investors unwilling to buy real estate in London or its current owners will not want to sell it,” he added.
The value of the first-class real estate — higher than 5 to 10 per cent of the priced housing market — grew to 11.8 per cent of the record last year in the well-known south-western London belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon.
According to a study by Savils, prices in the centre of London continued to show sustained growth of 5.6 per cent per annum, but they were obscured by the rapidly developing “voltage market” with prices in the south-west, in the north (7.4 per cent) and in the east (6.5 per cent) of the city.
Scientists shed light on how the dog’s tail movements are related to its mood.
More early studies have shown that happy dogs push their tail to the right side (from the dog's point of view), while the frightened dogs bend their tail primarily to the left.
But now scientists say that other members of the dog family can notice these subtle differences in tail swelling and react to them.
Professor George Vallortigar, neurobiologist at Trent University, says: “It is well known that the left and right of the brain are involved in the formation of people who have positive or negative emotions. ”
This is where we tried to look at this and other kinds of things.
He added that, like humans, the right part of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and two half-story plays different roles in emotions.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the various variations in the tails of other dogs, researchers observed animals when watching films about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of animals and analysed their behavior.
Maybe we'll soon understand why their tails are sometimes directed to one side and sometimes to the other.
Professor Valortigar said: “We have shown dogs videos with dogs — either naturalist versions or silhouettes to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the tail movement and drive the tail more to the left or to the right.”
When the animals saw that in the rest of the unexpressed dog the tail was moving right (from the point of view of the tail of the dog) they were totally weakened.
But when they noticed that the tail had shifted to the left (again from the tail to the dog), their hearts were touched and they looked anxious.
Professor Valortigar said that he did not think that the dogs had deliberately communicated with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that the dogs have learned from their experience what movements they should be concerned about and what they should not be concerned about.
He notes: “If there are several meetings with other dogs and their tailing is often linked to more friendly behavior and the right of the party gives less friendly behaviour, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians and hairdressers a deeper understanding of the emotions of their animals.
The expert on dog behavior John Bradshaw, an invited scientific officer at the University of Bristol veterinary school, said that it was not the first study to check whether it was relevant to the dog's left and the right of the party.
Last year, a group of researchers from Lincoln University found that dogs return their heads to the left if they look at the aggressive dog and right if they look at the rather dog.
In another scientific work at Victoria University, Canada, he reported: “The dogs were more likely to approach the robot dog when its tail was pushed to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming alarmed, the opposite of Italian research. ”
He said that the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully accept animals in films or at work as dogs.
It could be useful to study how dogs react to these dogs, he explained.
“While there is sufficient evidence that two brains are used for different purposes, many details are still to be clarified and dogs are not excluded,” he said.
However, given the ease with which they may be registered, we may soon understand why their tails are sometimes directed to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys play a concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock group postponed the concert in Glasgow after her vocalist was diagnosed with larynx.
The Chief Field Group was scheduled to take part in the City Hall of Hydro on Friday.

This group statement was made after it had been forced to postpone the concert at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In its official Arctic Monkeys website, the statement stated: “After deciding to transfer the show to the Birmingham LG Arena tonight and after treatment with Arctic Monkeys, the show should also be postponed to the Hydro Square in Glasgow on Friday, 1 November.”
“Alex Turner was diagnosed with laryngitis, and unfortunately he is unable to speak.”

Pope Francis names the first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will lead the new cardinals of the Catholic Church to the dream for the first time during his term of service on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they choose the pope, so France will appoint its first group of people who will eventually participate in the election of his successor.
There are 201 cardinals now.
However, after reaching the 80-year-old cardinal, he could no longer participate in the pope’s election, which is the prerogative of the 120 “cardinal electors”.
In announcing this news, the Vatican Press Secretary, Father Federico Lombardi, said that a meeting of all current cardinals, known as a consortium, would be held before the celebration.
“ Pope Francis decided to announce his decision to convene a consortium in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving cardinals from different corners of the world,” Lombardy said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic vote said that by February the number of cardinal voters was likely to decline.
He said that the pope usually calls as many cardinals as it takes to bring back the number of cardinals to 120, as well as the number of cardinals over 80 years of age as he wishes.
Consistency will be of great importance next year because it will be the first since the election of France in March of this year, according to Valero.
At present, there is a kind of advantage in favour of Europe and in particular in favour of Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new cardinal pope from other regions of the world will appoint to restore the balance,” he said.
In South America, 40 per cent of Catholics live, but they are not represented by any number of cardinals.
These will also be the first cardinals selected since the establishment of the French Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, who have been commissioned to search for ways to reform the church.
In the past, Dad decided everything on his own.
"Now France has chosen eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that "very possible", that France would refer to the cardinals after the council.
But we have not been in that situation before — all of this for the first time.
Valero said that the popes were usually taken to the office of cardinal bishops from large incomes, but France “a polo of surprises, so we don’t know who he is calling. ”
GM reacts to a number of new U.S. pickups to finish the seat back
General Motors Co reflects nearly 19,000 brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 models to address the problem of manual regulation of seat backrests, as reported by US regulatory authorities on Friday in the field of road safety.
On some of the pickaps, front seats may have a defect in the spindle.
As a result, the seats are not in conformity with the federal standards for road safety by head restraints.
“By hitting the car behind the head restraint, the driver and passengers may not be adequately protected by increasing the risk of injury,” says the National Road Safety Administration website.
These models were produced from 1 August to 10 September.
The GM pick-up started in June and is the most important starting-up of the car for the leading American auto manufacturer since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owners of the pickaps of a defect in the first half of October.
The National Road Safety Administration could not consider informing owners of the 16-day termination of the Government, which reduced the increase in car sales in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were modernized for a number of models in 2014, increased by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, as GM stated on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickup and 16,503 Sierra pickup.
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4 per cent on Friday until $37.47.
The cry of despair of Obama's electorate
I voted in favour of President Obama twice, sharing the hope of change
He said that Obama had allowed the obstruction of the Republicans to interfere with their efforts.
Obstructionism cannot justify problems with a web site reformed by Obama's health system, unmanned attacks
The 2008 Obama campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what could be
Nathaniel P. Morris is a graduate of the Second School of Medicine at Harvard University.
I'm reading a terriblely sad book these days.
I thought that this book would inspire me at the time of my graduation at the second medical school and give me a sense of hope.
It is called “Survey for Victory”, and it is a memoir of the 2008 Presidential Campaign of Barack Obama.
When I end up writing reports about my patients and lying in bed, this book brings me back when politics inspired millions of people, and speeches could take the spirit.
The victory in the elections was impressive, and the leading news programmes took a break to think about this historic moment.
My classmates cried out with joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could only find.
The White House should have come to a young strategy team, and the people were ready to change.
At the time of Obama's entry to the post in 2008, his support level was 82 per cent.
Then I close the book.
The return to the present is a gross awakening as a withdrawal from the dream.
It is hard to recall those days of optimism — they seem to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
Over the years since I missed my first ballot, changes have indeed taken place.
That was what I couldn't even imagine.
I commend Obama for his great and varied achievements, from the adoption of the law on accessible medical assistance to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, the abolition of the rules “Do not ask, do not speak”, of the murder of Usama Ben Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstruction has blocked too many attempts to advance our country: immigration reform, choice of public health and closure of the Guantanamo base among others.
But after a number of times, when I was on the side of Obama's administration, protecting her from colleagues and associates, I ended up explaining what I could provide.
I have reached the point of political despair.
Obstruction of Republicans cannot explain a permit to interrogate foreign leaders or to strike innocent children in other countries.
He could not explain the collection of data on the private life of Americans by the National Security Agency or the persecution of informants revealing the wrong actions of the Government.
He could not explain the murder of American citizen Anvar Al-Avlaki without trial and investigation or non-compliance with State funding limits and costs during presidential campaigns.
He could not justify the conclusions of the report, which stated that the White House's efforts to silence the media were “self-aggressive... from the time of the Nixon administration”.
And he has recently been unable to justify the failure to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the accessible medical care law.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Did I have to understand at the age of 18 that leadership could be contrary to the political campaigns that preceded it?
It is clear that the work of the elected office is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be formed by an opposition political party and by random events such as the Battle of Newtown.
Nevertheless, in all the examples mentioned above, it is clear that they were largely their own choice of administration.
And that's what worries me most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was a fan of enthusiasm for his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an unmistakable and harsh alternative, and it seemed that he was unable to decide on his own policies or views.
I thought that, in my second term, Obama, when he was released from the pressure of future elections, he justified the hopes that we had heard for such a long time.
However, when Obama’s rating fell below 45 per cent this week, it became much more difficult to return in 2008.
This keeps me wandering on many of the promises they've made.
This week, I read that part of the book describing how Clinton had put Obama into oblivion in the primary elections in Pennsylvania.
At a meeting to analyze the causes of failure, he told his staff that they should return to normal and remain faithful to their goal.
"I want us to return our attraction," he said.
"We must remember who we are."
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I fully agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary belong exclusively to Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer argues that MP Tony Ebbota has a conflict of interest in childcare leave.
Deputy billionaire Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Ebbota has a conflict of interest in the issue of child-care leave, because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining industry's magnet, which has an unresolved carbon tax tax dispute of $6 million, made this statement when it tried to get away from the question of whether it had a conflict.
The Palmer Joint Party may control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be crucial to the decision to abolish carbon taxes and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that the conflict of interest could only be in the hands of the ministers, and said that Mr. Ebbot's daughters would personally prove to be the winner of political action.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to a child’s paid leave for care, because if any of these daughters are pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether they get leave or not,” said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the elections, the electoral commission officially declared Mr. Palmer a winner in the fight against the seat of Sanshain-Costas electoral district, Fairfax, with a vote of 53, after the recalculated vote.
Mr. Palmer called for a revision of the vote count procedure in the electoral process to accelerate the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbot Francis and Bridget.
Should it be decided on these elections two months after we voted?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why don't we have this system so that we can come in, put our data in the computer, immediately vote and get the result at 18:30 p.m. the same night?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of cartridges for notes in the bulletins.
That's because they can control the outcome if someone doesn't like it?
It seems strange to use krandash in our time.
The Electoral Commission is exploring the possibility of an electronic vote and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59-year-old, said that his programme included an international airport for Sanshain-Costat and would be “a lot of serious” in relation to his new work.
The Public Service is a public service.
“We do not get any awards except for the history of what we can serve in critical moments in this district,” he said.
RBS removes two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland temporarily removed two traders from its currency operations division, according to the information provided by the two people familiar with the situation, which is yet another confirmation that the global verification of the expected manipulations in the currency market is rapidly taking place.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations involving the world's largest financial market, whose daily turnover is $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS staff to be removed during the triggering investigation, which is called a scandal related to interbank manipulations of the LIBOR rate.
By refusing to comment on the withdrawals, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from the regulatory authorities this month.
“Our ongoing investigation of this issue continues, and we fully cooperate with the FCA and our other regulators,” the bank reported two weeks ago.
Last month, informed persons said that RBS had transmitted e-mails and instant messages that had received and sent its former trader to the UK Financial Control Office (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left the RBS in 2010 and, as far as is known, he was granted a leave on his current post to the head of European spot exchange trading in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the Citi European Spot Trade, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, the former senior currency trader in Barclays and UBS, was removed from work by Standard Chartered Bank this week.
None of these traders were charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher ' s Emergency Communications Group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, as informed persons.
The Bank of UBS reported this week that it had taken action against some of its staff after Swiss regulator Finma said that it was investigating alleged manipulations in the currency market in several Swiss banks.
At least six world regulators — the European Commission, Finma, the anti-monopoly organ of Switzerland Weko, FCA, the U.S. Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Office — are considering allegations that bankers have entered into a dispute to influence the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also started internal checks or received requests for information from the regulatory authorities, said familiar with the situation of the person.
Banks have been watching instant messages and e-mails for several years in search of offences.
The audit has prompted traders in the field of activities, which have been one of the largest sources of income for investment banks, which this year, however, has faced difficulties because low volatility of the currency reduces favourable opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the seriousness of the situation, saying that it is virtually impossible to manipulate a large and highly liquid currency market, but senior traders say it is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trade in the currency market, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the wider use by banks of their domestic platforms means that “you can begin to influence the market at a very low price”.
This news came the same day as the Bank of Credit Suisse announced that he fired one of the traders of his London Stock Exchange fund sales department this week, after it had caused a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately informed the relevant authorities and cooperated with its regulators.
“We are confident that the trader acted alone and that the issue could be localized,” Credit Suisse said.
The Supreme Court supported Obama's Health Act
The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that the Barack Obama Health Act was constitutional, which was a major victory for Obama's administration.
With a vote of 5 against 4, the judges decided that separate orders under the Patient Protection Act and accessible health care requiring citizens to obtain medical insurance before 2014 or pay a fine were constitutional in accordance with the authority of the Government on taxation.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined four more liberal members of the court, while the judges of Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy opposed.
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of this 2,700-sided law and further decided that the requirement of the Health Act to increase compliance of States with the requirements of the Medicaid programme, otherwise losing all federal funding of the Medicaid programme, was not unconstitutional.
The bill's blocking claim was submitted by 26 states and by the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the major Republicans candidates in the presidents during the 2012 primary election season, including the alleged candidate, Mitt Romni.
Football — Why Different?
In the context of the Open Tribunal, politicians and experts spoke about how to maintain national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was the banning of football in the North Caucasus, because from this game, there are scandals and divisions.
Speaker Sergey Nariskin recalled the recent developments in Burma and said that policies and media should be adjusted in terms of lowering the "tensions in society".
He probably meant a recent scandal with Vladimir Girinovski, who in one of the broadcasters threatened to surround the Caucas with a noose if they didn't want to limit fertility...
All speakers also spoke about measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries and on measures to harmonise relations between the peoples of Russia, which contributed to the controversy.
Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Birileve were "the model conflict that could have been predicted", but "we have too many people and institutions responsible for these issues," and seven children without eyes.
The concept of multiculturalism, which for a long time has been practiced by migrants in Europe, in the opinion of the public, has failed and needs to seek its way.
The historian Yury Peterov had high hopes for a new one.
"It is still necessary to create a cultural benefit for the peoples of the country, so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know that people live in Dagestan, and vice versa," he said.
Gennadius Zuganov suggested that he be charged with "calling for Russian disbanding": "If you say on the radio that you have to give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and sentenced to 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Girinovski tried very hard not to burn.
As usual, he accused journalists throughout the world who posed painful and harsh national issues for public discussion: "In the dust of controversy, there is little to say!"
The leader of the Russian Only Party, Vladimir Vasiliev, advised reporters here to close the paper and agree to hold talks on this subject in a timely manner, and then the same commitments can be made to themselves and to politics.
We have passed about 30 laws governing migration and in general, Mr. Vasiliev said.
As an example, he introduced a law that places regional and municipal authorities in charge of international peace in their territory.
But Lukmila Andrichenko warned against this law: it had “no clear perceptions of the adaptation of migrants, their mechanisms and their limits.
Thus, the entities will treat the various levels of these powers.
In addition, municipalities have no staff needed to deal with such complex issues, no funds, and the methodological recommendations that they could use do not provide them with...
The head of the National Affairs Committee, Gajimet Safaraliev, proposed the establishment of a special department called “Ministry of National Security”, which would deal with national policy issues.
But Valerie Tiskov, who led a similar institution in the 1990s, subsequently abolished, opposed.
It is enough to have a special person at the federal level, the Minister without a wallet, to which one could be contacted, if so.
"We're going to the edge, the shells are falling apart, it's very important for representatives of different ethnic groups and religions to speak together against provocations, and this work should get decent information support," said the representative of the RPC on relations with the society of Zestvold Chaplin.
No State's neutrality with regard to dangerous ideologies, including religious, should be held against it.
This is where Oleg Nelov put the discussion in an unexpected tone: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan still need to be sought, but they are not pushed that way, not that way," he said.
"Not the way" is the development of football: "The football player beats the whole crowd, the flag is jogging, the friends are throwing stones at each other...
Maybe we don't need football like that?
There's another kind of sport - the regbi is called...
"There will be no fairs in the world in this kind of sport!" said boroross.
There will be no one to play in the Kauksa regiment, Mr. Girinovski has been involved.
You're still offering them a ride!
We need to know the national characteristics, but it's the same thing as offering the cargo "The Firebreaker""...
In Yaroslav, there were representatives of the Moscow club in the wild, during the games with the local club.
Football must be banned all over the country...
The head of the RFS Monitoring and Discipline Committee, Arthur Grigoryanz, reported that "Cuban" has been penalized for 500 thousand rubles, transferring from the U.S. football correspondent Philip PAPENKOV from the House.
Such sanctions for the Red Cross Club were applied for the fire of the Dagestan flag by patients at the court during the 14th round-trip match against Anji.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a member of the RFPL.
We've studied all the available materials.
For the wrong conduct of the Cuban audiences, 500 thousand rubles have been fined.
Against Google, Samsung, Huawei patent applications issued by Nortel
The Group, which has thousands of former Nortel patents, submitted a series of patent claims against mobile phone producers, including Google, whose price it ran for Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar Consortium, which had purchased $2.5 billion of Nortel patents, filed claims for a violation of patent rights in the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is shared by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help compare key words of search on the Internet with their respective advertisements, says the claim that is the basis of Google's search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones working on Google's Android operating system, which is fiercely competing with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google proposed an initial price of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased the proposed price several times, eventually offering a total of $4.4 billion.
The loss of Nortel patents at Rockstar's consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, which was partly a patent library for Motorola.
“In spite of the unsuccessful attempt to acquire the auction patents that are the subject of the request, Google has violated and continues to violate them,” the court claims.
Rockstar claims that Google claims that the violation of patent rights is intended, as required.
In Egypt, the first freely elected president takes an oath
Muhammad Murcy took an oath, but the day of his celebration was unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohammed Mursi promised “new Egypt” when he swore, he became the first freely elected president of the country, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was defeated 16 months ago.
At its inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth head of State in Egypt after the monarchy was defeated some 60 years ago.
He swore before 18 judges in black robes in the building of a court on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of the ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are looking forward to a better future, new Egypt and the second Republic,” Mursi said at a ceremony in the direct air on public television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life — absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said Mursi, a 60-year-old American education engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, which was most of the 84 years of its existence banned by an organization that served as a target for harsh actions by changing governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police, when Murcy arrived with a small cortege soon after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the courthouse to welcome the new president, and, unlike the President's pump Mubarak time, the movement was stopped only for a short time to miss his autocolon on the usual road that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs.
Although Mursy was a non-harismatic “save wheel” of the Brothers, his personal prestige grew sharply since his victory and Friday speech, in which he tried to present himself not only as a candidate for Islamists, but also all those who wanted to bring the case to the end of the 2011 rebellion against authoritarian Mubarak.
“Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and contemporary State,” said Mursi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, to judges in the wooden panels of the hall where he took his oath.
Morsi later went to the University of Cairo, where he had to speak his inaugural speech.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra, performing a State gym, during which he stood “slow”.
Military officer Feldmarshal Husain Tantavi was present.
His arrival was met with the slogan “Army and People — One Hand”, which scandalized hundreds of those gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908, the University of Cairo became the circle of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, where there was a resurrection that ended with the authoritarian regime of Mubarak last year, and promised to return the credentials of the President whose post was deprived of the military council, who took action by the defeated leader.
But having agreed to take an official oath before the court, not before Parliament, as it has been agreed, it is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
The word Morsi on Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
A special meeting of the Association of Industrialists of the Tumen Region was held on the basis of the Jalutorov automobile plant.
As part of the event, the presentation of a new line for the production of steel electrodes.
As explained by the business director of Denis Gribanov, a marketing study was carried out in 2011 with the presence of a new owner on the market for steel constructions in the Tumen region.
It has been found that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electric tubes per month.
Thereafter, a decision was taken to change the vehicle profile and to install equipment on it for their production.
More than 7,000 tonnes of production have been charged this year.
Investments in the plant amounted to more than 120 million rubley, said Denis Gribanov.
In October, a new state was launched to increase the range.
The plant has both a small tube profile that is used for carpeting, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry and large for the construction industry.
We plan to produce 50,000 tonnes of production per year, representing about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tumen region.
Despite the transition to another type of activity, the number of staff in the enterprise has not decreased - now it is 157, in plans for the purchase of new equipment - by more than 50 employees.
The enterprise is retraining, and the necessary specialists are selected from the existing ones.
The next year, the introduction of a new long-lasting scrap aggregate has become a thickness of up to five millimetres, which will reduce the cost of the product, as well as another condition, with a tube production rate of up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, companies are planning to develop the output of pipes used in housing and Communism.
The company's management is tasked with closing up to 70 per cent of the needs of the Tumen area in this product.
The Deputy Director of Investment Policy, Leonid Ostromov, addressed the heads of production, advised more attention to modernization of machinery.
This is also the case in the form of State support for industry, which includes the reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of its lease.
For the current year, 150 million rubles have been allocated, two thirds of which have already been lost.
The last commission, which will consider grant contracts, shall adopt documents from undertakings until 15 November.
In addition, the budget reimburses the costs of the participation of local producers in international trade marks.
For the next year, the budget has a budget of 150 million rubles that can be used to compensate for lease payments and loans for the acquisition of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated to the fairs, 3 million for energy conservation programmes.
Up to 72 million rubles are being reduced to reimbursement of the ordered and paid equipment made in the southern Tumen area for the oil gas complex.
According to Leonida Ostroumov, this form of support is expected to cease, as it was the reason for the introduction of the tax on the acquisition of useful fossils paid by oil companies in the area budget.
They do not do so at present, and subsidies become direct cost commitments in the region.
In view of this, the Government considers the area to be a priority for the direct support of industrial enterprises rather than the financing of the oil industry through them.
Budget assistance will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented in production.
Many business managers expressed concern about the oil situation.
The equipment they purchase is a competitive advantage for the South Tumen region industry, and it will be difficult to compete at the price of the Russian average, where the lower labour force is more expensive.
In addition, there is an unclear question about the legacy of the new owner of TNC-WR, Rosneft, who has not yet placed his orders on the Tumen companies.
The agreement on the implementation of the Uvat project expires in 2013, and no applications for extension have been made.
South-area companies specializing in equipment for the oil sector are currently unable to form a portfolio of orders for the future year.
The question remains whether taxes from the oil source in the Uvatian region will be received into the region's budget, or whether they will be paid at the location of registration of the new homeowner.
Tomic plays 240 hours for the extremist role in the socset
The Leninian District Court of Tomsk sentenced the city's inhabitants to 240 hours of compulsory work, which had posted an extremist video network, told RIA News on Friday, a press representative of the District Court.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man posted a video on his website in a popular social network, which was posted in a federal list of extremist materials.
A criminal case was brought against him under the article “Acts aimed at the incitement of hatred and hatred, as well as the humiliation of human dignity by the public”.
"The Leninian District Court considered the case in a special manner and recognized the man as guilty of the above-mentioned crime by appointing a punishment of 240 hours of compulsory work," said the interviewer of the agency.
She added that the man fully admitted his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians a price for goods after signing an association with the European Union
The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Nikolai Azarov, is convinced that the country's prices will decrease significantly after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He said that during the discussion with readers of his page at Facebook.
I can of course say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
Thus, following the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Zone, the level of customs duties on imports from the EU will be significantly reduced.
And that would mean that prices should be reduced.
"This is about goods coming from EU countries," Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be focused.
However, there should not be any price increases.
Therefore, reports on billboards that have recently appeared enough in our country, that association with the EU is an increase in prices, not at all, or if more precise - not at all," said Azarov.
The investigators verify information on ill-treatment with the child in Biscay
On 29 October, the media reported that an educator in one of the children ' s gardens of the city of Bijska had detained the child in the basement for educational purposes.
The investigators are now clarifying all the circumstances, as well as legally evaluating the actions of childcare staff.
After the accusations of stupidity, Evgenia Vasileva made a statement
Evgeny Vasileva, who has been paying close attention to the media for almost a year, has not yet commented on numerous publications in the press, both on the thefts in Minowan and on them personally, on relations with former Minister of Defence Anatoli Serdujkov, its poetry and on the passion for valuables.
On 1 November, however, the Defence Service figure violated the silence.
In an interview with Life News Vasileva, he said, "Indeed, the task was to get out of me any negative information about the former Minister of Defence."
There was a scandal that I had to give a witness, otherwise I was put in prison.
To this day, these threats have ceased.
We're going to court, we're going to prove our innocence.
We have 100 per cent confidence in victory.
In this interview, it is possible to conclude that most of Vasileu’s words about her taste are not important.
It is likely that the statement by the official representative of the RF, Vladimir Markin, that there was a sub-department in the collection of paintings collected by the Defence Service figure.
Among the property seized are a number of paintings that the owner, convinced of his deep knowledge of art, acquired as the world’s masterpieces.
However, the artistic expertise appointed by investigators after the arrest of these paintings found that they had no artistic value and were simply cheap undercover," Markin noted at the beginning of October.
Some pictures stolen from the Ministry of Defence...
And then they admitted that they weren't stolen from Minombo, and they said I had a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
I think it's just an impenetrable thing," Vasileva says.
On the question whether she recognized her guilt even in one of the 12 criminal episodes she had been subjected to, Vasileva said, "Of course not.
Admit nothing at all.
Moreover, there is no harm to the Russian Federation.
They're just misleading people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement by the HR, that Vasileva is avoiding the study of criminal material, the figure lawyer stated that he and his client “the investigator is not familiar with the material”.
What was the reason for the revelations under the house arrest of Vasilev, not yet in contact with the press?
Maybe how could she not answer the accusation in a bad way?
Or did the rights of journalists from Cosmosmolki, who a few days ago claimed that she had “falled into an even bigger trance under house arrest” due to reports of the reconciliation of Anatolia Serdujkov and his return to his family?
A famous military observer, Victor Baranec, in his article "Serdjukov returned to the woman?" wrote: "The trackers do not rule out that after such a shock, it may become more talkative in questioning."
In the past, Vasileva had been charged with some of the allegations of the illegal sale of the real estate of Minowan.

You think the tourists left in the past with the Internet?
The Flight Centre seems to have a reverse trend.
The company has updated its income forecast for the full year and expects record revenues from vacationers in Australia and Britain.
The tourism company now expects its main annual income to be from $325 to $340 million, compared to the previous forecast in the range of $305 to $315 million.
If the current orientations are achieved, this will be a 12-17 per cent increase compared to the record income of $290.4 million received in 2011/2012.
The Managing Director, Graham Turner, said that Flight Centre had received 8 per cent of the first half of the year and had started the second half of the year with good indicators, especially on Sunday trips to Australia and Britain.
“From the beginning of the year, we have been working on income in our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to have a record of high income before deduction of interest and tax contributions for the full year,” he said.
- This is Australia and the United Kingdom, which usually brings us the greatest profits."
In Australia, a business in the field of leisure in the second half of the year was restored, which offset a slightly weaker internal market for corporate travel.
Similarly, the UK business Flight Centre in the field of leisure was doing well, while corporate customers were spending less.
Her business in the United States offset the losses suffered during the season of the weak first half and was expected to receive income in the third full year in the afternoon.
Yesterday Flight Centre shares grew by 3 cents to $38.20.

He was the first to work in the Industrial Area on Vljetno Street.
At the time of the check in the institution, the game went.
We had 24 cars at the club.
Another game club was found in the Lenin district on the street of Anton Petrov.
20 slot machines were used here.
UNMIS Russia on Barnaul reports that administrative material has been prepared under the article “Foreign Organizations and Gambling”.
They took the technique.
In the near future, evidence on the facts will be sent to the courts of the Industrial and Lenin districts of the city.
In Ekaterinburg, a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies
In Ekaterinburg, the police are investigating a criminal who has been brutally quarrelling with two sisters.
After the murders, their bodies burned.
As reported to the "New Region" in the press service of the U.S. M.U.R.S. in the Sverdlovska area, two women were found recently in the Kyiv area of the city after the fire was extinguished in a three-room apartment located in a residential home on the street of Uralska, with signs of violent death.
The persons of the deceased were soon identified.
It was found that they were sisters, one of them was a resident of Ekaterinburg 44 years old, the other was a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg area.
The hottest apartment they took off a few days ago.
His investigation took personal control of the chief police region of Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs authorities draw up various versions of the murder, check the alibis of former convicted citizens and persons inclined to such acts.
In addition, the purpose of which women were removed from their apartment and where they lived prior to what they were dealing with was established.
Schools called for more attention to mathematics, orphography and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one play of Shakespeare, the 19th - century novel, the romantic poetry, and modern British artistic literature since 1914.
The examination will also provide “non-programme texts” to encourage greater reading.
The joint course of English literature and language will be abolished.
Since 2015, students will be required to submit a separate language exam, with strong recommendations for the selection of English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education should issue new training programmes on English and mathematics tomorrow, the first subject subject to radical revision.
It will make changes to other major items next year.
The separate regulatory body in the field of examinations of OFQUAL will present a revised structure for secondary school graduations, with a new evaluation system and a smaller number of courses.
In the summer speech, Minister of Education Michael Howe said that there would be “a broad consensus that we should reform our exam system to restore public confidence”, insisting that school graduation exams would be “more complex, more ambitious and more stringent”.
Studies show that English schools give less time to mathematics (116 hours a year, or three hours a week during the fourth period) than most countries.
To compare, Australian schools give an average of 143 hours a year, and students in Singapore spend about 138 hours.
While the formal requirement to spend more time on mathematics is not available, the coalition sources said that large school graduations on mathematics in conjunction with the higher rate in the rating table would probably provide an incentive to provide additional education for schools on this subject.
In the curriculum, more attention will be paid to “real life challenges”, including financial mathematics.
Tickets in The Hague will be delivered to tourists in 2,200 rubles
Tomorrow morning from Blagovesko in The Hague, the tourists will begin to drive the vessels on the air cushion.
For those wishing to come to China, this means additional losses
The ticket on the puma is traditionally worth much more than the heat.
As reported in the AmurASSO reference service, the value of the usual ticket is 2,200 rubles.
The walk through the comfort hall will be 2,800 rubles.
In this season, the tickets did not travel: at the same price, they drove tourists and the past spring, and the year back in autumn.
Dmitry Medvedev: GDP growth is not sufficient for the development of the State
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers that the growth rate of GDP is insufficient for the RF and is convinced that the situation can be improved by simplifying business lending and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation, Reuters reports.
We planned to increase GDP this year in the area of 3%, perhaps even more.
It'll actually be less than 2 per cent.
In the face of recession in a number of countries in Europe, it would not be very bad, but for us, it is small, because the economic base is not as powerful as in a number of countries in general, and in order to develop, it must be at a higher rate.
It is now very important that the Russian companies, the Russian business, receive normal loans at the normal price, which is the first thing that must be done," stressed the head of the Government.

Journey through the mountains, rivers and jungles to provide free medical care
Dr. George Bwelle provides free medical care in rural Cameroon
Bwelle and his team run almost every exit, taking hundreds of patients
Not so many doctors in this West African country — only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. George Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN heroes in 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 major heroes to make him the Year CNN.
This person will receive $250 000 to continue his outstanding work.
Within 21 years, George Bwelle saw his father return to life and return to unconsciousness, looking for hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
James Bwelle suffered a car crash in 1981 near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but the infection spread to the brain and caused a hematoma that reminded him of for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said George Bwelle.
If we had the money, we'd get him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle accompanied his father for years in overcrowded hospitals and hospitals with any treatment they could receive.
"It's not easy," Bwelle said.
- You can leave home at 5:00 a.m. to go to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Father Bwelle ended in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor in Cameroon for 5,000 people.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413.
And even if the cameramen could contact the doctor, many of them wouldn't care.
Two out of five people in that country live in poverty, and nearly three fourths of the health costs are private.
“Their only problem is poverty,” Bwelle said.
“And because of poverty they cannot enjoy their lives.”
Seeing his father's suffering and many of his fellow citizens, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. George Bwelle and his team of volunteers conducted 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and worked as a paramedic surgeon at Yaounde Central Hospital.
It also established an ASCOVIME non-commercial organization, which organizes visits to rural areas on exits to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people are loaded in vans, tied to medical supplies, and going to the intersections to visit the village in need of assistance.
They don't always have luck.
Sometimes they had to push their cars through rivers and mud.
But when they come, they meet them like these heroes: it's a party with songs and dances and the best rooms that locals can only offer.
Free health care in these villages is indeed a occasion for a holiday, and Bwelle, with its wide smile and limitless energy, is more than happy to join in.
The next morning, the brigade starts taking hundreds of patients.
"We take 500 people on each trip," Bwelle said.
They come from all over the district within 60 miles [60 km] of the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these exit clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive a gift, a gifted eye, or a free birth certificate — documents required for schools that many poor families simply cannot afford.
After dinner, the brigade conducts simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in the school building, municipality or home; after the procedure, patients stand up and go to the post-operative zone to free up their place for the next person.
By using a generator to illuminate the operation and sanitation of equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers are working until early Sunday morning.
This is an insatiable pace, but the brigade’s zeal usually helps to support village musicians.
"They beat us all night in the drums to keep us awake and keep working," Bwelle said.
On Sunday, members of the brigade are sent back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
The group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, carried out 700 free operations last year, and they know that their assistance may be of enormous importance to those they assist.
One man explained that he had received a free care operation that would allow him to work again.
"This will change the future for me and my family," said the man.
In addition to these clinical admissions to the exit and hospital, surgeon Bwelle also works nights in private medical clinics around Yaounde.
It is this second job, he said, that provides 60 per cent of the financing of its non-commercial organization; the remaining funds are covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's asleep," said Katie O'Malley, a medical student at the second degree at Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer at the Bwelle Group.
He's always in the hospital, or he's trying to make money for the organization so that he can continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Melli, coming from the United States and Europe, to join Bwell in carrying out his tasks, this is an opportunity that they would never have received at home.
“We have been given the opportunity to assist in operations where we have helped remove five bloods or hold instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” O’Melli said.
As a high school student, you'd never get that opportunity in America.
Volunteers usually pay for their trip to Cameroon, often with donated medications.
But upon arrival in Yaounde, their food, transportation, and training pay Bwelle.
"He's a hero, no doubt," said O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon endlessly.
For Bwelle, the almost permanent load of work is not a difficult test.
To help others live a happy life, to fulfill this promise to their father is to bring him great joy.
“ I’m so happy when I do this work, ” Bwelle said.
- And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh to ease their pain.
Go to ASCOVIME and see what you can help.
Snouden agreed to give evidence of Merkel's pardon.
The Bundestag's deputy Hans-Christian Strebele met with Edward Snowden in Moscow.
During the discussion, the question was whether Snouden could be questioned as a witness to the FRG's Branch Office in the case of a possible hearing of the German chancellor's phone by U.S. Special Forces.
Snoudden expressed his willingness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could be held either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear, said Hans-Christian Strebel, that he knows a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency led by Kit Alexander blocked all his movements, Snowden was ready to come to Germany.
However, all conditions of his arrival must first be clearly defined.
In the meantime, American legislators are beginning to take action in response to the scandal surrounding US spy programmes.
Yesterday, the Senate Intelligence Committee approved a bill imposing additional restrictions on the activities of the American Electronic Intelligence Authority.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all areas and areas.
Regarding this, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus Vladimir Macei told reporters at a press conference following a meeting with Turkey's Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, the correspondent of BELTA reported.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in the development and deepening of the Belarusian-Turkish relations in all areas and areas.
Belarus is also interested in this, so we have agreed that the two countries' public administrations will provide broad support and support to entrepreneurs that establish direct trade and economic contacts between themselves," said Vladimir Macei.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all necessary conditions and provide maximum assistance.
The Minister also reported that the 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission had been held in Ankara, resulting in the signing of the Protocol.
The parties drew up a road map of Belarus-Turkey cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy authority, aims at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade, economic and investment areas, in the fields of industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, and new forms and ways of interaction.
"The protocol of the last meeting has been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the present protocol will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey consider each other to be reliable partners," he said.
Turkey's Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, reported that during the negotiations, the heads of the foreign political agencies of the two countries decided to continue to develop mutually beneficial cooperation and to implement various projects.
Trade between Belarus and Turkey, in the opinion of the Minister, should be increased and brought to $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed, as there is no unused capacity in this area, he believes.
There has always been a very warm relationship between our countries, and we hope that they will further strengthen and expand.
All necessary conditions will also be created for trade and economic links and for the successful work of Turkish companies in the territory of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey," Ahmet Davutoglu noted.
Obama renounces his words of health
In the midst of the critical storm, President Obama yesterday went to the fifth of his frequent, unanimous promise that “if you like your medical insurance plan, you can keep it.”
Since hundreds of thousands of people have been notified of the termination of services from their providers, Republicans have recently criticised the President for misleading American society.
yesterday Obama made a few changes to his original public promise.
“Most people with medical insurance that works can keep it,” he said in his speech in Boston.
With regard to what he called a “revitalization in the news”, Obama called upon those receiving these notifications to look for other options on the market.
Most people will be able to obtain better comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get better conditions," he said.
The Administration stated that no one should be surprised that 5 per cent of the people who buy insurance on their own might be forced to change their plans because their coverage did not meet the new standards required by the Law on Access to Medical Care.
"Let me tell these Americans that you deserve the best," Sibelius said in a speech before the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sybelius, who protects the implementation of the accessible medical care law, said that the launch of the Internet sales site was “horrifyingly bad” since October.
“ I’m upset and upset just like everything else, ” she said.
- I really want your trust back."
The angry Sibelius defended this phrase, which was captured by the included microphone, which was the assistant in yesterday's hearings in the Chamber after a heated debate with a member of the House of Representatives Billi Long, a Republican of Missouri, whether she was obliged to join Obama's health programme herself.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long urged Sibelius once again to say why the “archittor” of the accessible medical assistance law did not voluntarily decline the insurance sponsored by the Government to acquire a plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now imposes on millions of Americans.
Rosbalt Agency Deprived of Media Status for Uncensored Defense
On 31 October, Mosgorsud decided to accept an invalid license to register the agency Rosbalt, as Lenta writes.
The lack of media status agency insisted on Roskonadozor - for systematic and gross violations of the media law.
During the trial, an unpleasant precedent was created: the court considered it possible to close the media, in fact refusing to issue any counter-arguments.
What's "Rosbalt"?
The Rosbalt Information Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In subsequent years, the Agency opened the second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The Agency also has representations in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and operated as a federal information and analysis agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency had listed Russia's most familiar private media.
However, Rosbalt has always had a rather specific niche: the Agency's core of exclusive publications was (and still is) a note referring to sources in law enforcement.
Talks about the proximity of the publication to the force structures continued throughout the Agency.
In addition to the fact that Rosbalt had a large source base in various institutions, it was also in favour of such assumptions that Natalia Chaplina, the wife of Victor Churchesova, was in the head of the project.
However, the role of Chaplin in the Rosbalt leadership is unclear: it is most often referred to as the project manager.
The Director-General of the Agency is Larissa Afonina, editor-general Nikolai Ulyanov.
In recent times, Rosbalt has not been listed in federal media ratings, either by quote or by audience.
In October, the agency took the 25th place in the Russian media website rating on LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the Wednesday audience of the rosbalt.ru site is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand visits), a monthly audience of about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the past five months are the comments on Kremlin's incompetence with Ukraine, the death of the solistist group "King and Shut", the massacres in the capital city of Biruleva.
The Rosbalta conflict with Roscondasor began in July 2013, when an amendment to the media law was introduced, banning journalists from non-consensual protests.
The news found a banned lecture in two of the video agency's website ("Jigit of Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot have desecrated oil.").
The following paragraphs describe different aspects.
Rosbalt was accused of gross and systematic violations of the media law on the basis of the video material found and appealed to the court to select a licence from the agency.
In Rosbalte, claims were incorrect: first, the roles were not editorial material, second, the mother's words were masked, and thirdly, immediately after the role was warned, the site was removed.
The Agency ' s representatives complained about the claims of Roskonnaszor in the world court, and when Mosgorsud adopted the request of Roskonnaszor on 22 October 2013, these complaints were still pending.
However, 25 world judges have already taken a decision not in favour of Rosbalt: Chief Editor Nikolai Ulianov has been found guilty of a violation of the Code of Administrative Offences and has been penalized for 20,000 rubles - for 10,000 per roll.
Obviously, this predestined the outcome of the Mosgorsud hearing - if you refuse to think that the outcome could have been predestined earlier.
On 31 October, the court decided to accept the invalidity of the Rosbalt registration certificate by depriving the media agency of its status.
It cannot be said that Rosbalt remained alone during this opposition.
The Agency supported the representatives of Gosmuda (a statement by the head of Roskondaszor, Alexander Gharov, signed on 10 October; the document itself was submitted on the initiative of CRC).
The publication ' s closing was not correct. The head of the Union of Journalists of Russia, Svełod Bogdanov, President of the Moscow Union of Journalists, Pavel Gusev, and the head of the President ' s Human Rights Council, Mikhail Fedotov.
In addition, according to Bogdanova, the Roskondaszor leadership has even provided him with some assurance that the case will not come before the licence is withdrawn.
The decision on "Rosbalt" showed that the media in Russia is more secure under whose jurisdiction today is a major issue.
Syria has destroyed equipment for arms
Syria destroyed all declared chemical weapons, recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of disarmament was completed by the day before the deadline.
By 1 November, Syria had to destroy production and other support facilities intended for the preparation of combatants for use, transferred Bi-bi-si.
The destruction of stocks of toxic substances themselves or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of OPCW, the toxic substances are currently in sealed warehouses.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people died during a chemical attack on the coast of Damascus on 21 August.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition.
These productive powers will now be carefully monitored so as not to allow them to do so.
The next wave is mid-November: by that time OPCW and the Syrians should agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stocks of toxic substances.
There's a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide this equipment?
All Syrian statements will be carefully verified by Western intelligence.
They are willing to advise inspectors on new facilities to check if there are grounds for suspecting that Damascus is not open to the end.
It is estimated that the shooting was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the case of the Syrian rebels.
The world community has called for the Syrian leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached through Russia, to destroy or irreplace all the power for the production of gas and liquid propellants and for the filling of the shells of these substances.
Now that this phase is completed, the next step must be the destruction of the Syrian army of arms.
This arsenal may contain more than 1000 tons of nerve-paralytic toxic substances, natural gas and other prohibited chemicals in several tens of different locations.
It is necessary for the OPCW and the Syrian authorities to agree on a timetable for action to begin with a two-week period.
The Head of Field Operations, OZHO Jerry Smith, told Bi-bi-si that his inspectors were “supplying the destruction of equipment in person”.
"They are now unable to carry on the production or mixing of chemical weapons," he said.
The OPCW statement states that the inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and convinced that the plants for the production of shellfish and toxic substances were either destroyed or inadvertent.
The remaining two objects are too dangerous to carry out an inspection, as stated in the document, but the equipment has been transported and checked by OZHO specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destruction of the infrastructure for the production of arms was “inexhaustible”, as work had to be done in the context of the ongoing conflict.
At the beginning of October, OZHO received the Nobel Peace Prize, but Smith said that it was time for inspectors to make it clear that they were too busy working.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented confession that the United States's spying has gone unfavorably far
John Kerry demonstrated a reduction in the protection tactics of US tracking programmes, making it unprecedentable that in some cases, US espionage “has gone unfavorable far.”
The Secretary also acknowledged that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, that he was “on the pilot” during Edward Snowden’s massive disclosures about the ANB’s spy activities.
These leaks have put the U.S. Government at the centre of the diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking on video at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the Government, have actually taken up some of the things that are happening on the aircraft, because this was already the case — and during the Second World War, and in very difficult years of cold war, and finally, 11 September.”
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. Government to acknowledge that the United States had gone too far, but stressed that no rights had been violated.
He said: In some cases it is an evil thing.
And the president is determined to shed light on this matter and to explain it to people, and he is now conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has a sense of abuse.
I believe that there is no injustice in this matter to the innocent people."
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the ANB had acted in good faith and that his tracking operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We are working in a new world where people are willing to explode.
In the world there is radical extremism, unreasonable and full determination to kill people, to explode people and to attack governments.
What if you were able to capture it, stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented the violations of aircraft, the explosions of buildings and the killing of people, because we have been able to learn about these plans in advance."
Meanwhile, American legislators will go to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged United States spies abroad and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint counter-terrorism activities with the United States, said the Chair of the Senate Committee on European Affairs on Thursday.
The Senator of Connecticut Chris Murphy said that he had been talking to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participation in anti-terrorism organizations because of disappointment over the incident carried out by the National Security Agency.
“For the interests of U.S. national security, it is indeed important that Europeans remain our proponents for our common anti-terrorism efforts,” said Merfia, a first-time Democrat who is chaired by the Senate's sub-committee on European Affairs, in an interview with Washington.
“And I am going to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NPT programmes.”
The fact that the ANB has collected millions of telephone records in Europe has deteriorated relations with some US allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were incorrect and reflected the lack of understanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and shared with the United States.
Other disclosures included documents published by Snoudden showing that the ANB was monitoring the mobile phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, as well as the telephones of some 34 other world leaders.
The Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has protected spy activities against allies as necessary and said it is a normal case on both sides.
In the light of this noise, Murphy said that his office was organizing a visit to the Congress, which was expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the members of both parties and the two Chambers would be included in the delegation.
The names of other participating legislators should be ringed in the coming days.
He said that the travel programme was still under development.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of the trip was to promote better relations, he said that some degree of “hardness from the best moods” would also be shown.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people in what spy programmes they had used themselves for many years.
“While we can change our tracking programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also agree that we are not the only ones involved in intelligence activities,” Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry should be sent to these exits in the Middle East and Poland to address the hostility of the United States strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the United States intelligence.
The new members of the public observation commissions will increase the impact of prisoners
Today, the Board of Public Chambers (PS) can adopt new compositions of the public observation commissions (NGOs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If a voting option is adopted, the Lobbies will increase their influence.
The UNC is a public structure that controls the conditions of detention in places of detention.
The actions of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonida Razwozjaev, the riots in the Kopaya colony, are the result of the UNC, and most of the resonant incidents have been reported.
There is a struggle between human rights defenders and lobbyists.
At the meeting of the OPC working group on the formation of the OPC, I proposed that the experience of human rights should be selected.
"It was not accepted, and lists were drawn up without criteria," says Valerie Borštev.
The current President of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers is the universal human rights defenders ' structure in prison.
In his home country, he developed a law governing the activities of the UN.
The OPC Council should vote for the membership of the OPC in 43 regions of the country.
In 1800 vacancies were claimed by fewer than a thousand people, while in Ingushetia and in the Balkans, competitions could not be organised due to the lack of candidates.
The OP promises to organize a selection of vacancies.
The Moscow ONK is one of a few commissions with a competition, despite the fact that 20 participants will be in place in the new one.
According to Borschewa, the current composition of the civil commission of 11 human rights defenders and 9 armed forces and the option of voting in the OPC varies from 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders were wanted to be on the board.
Therefore, the representative of the "God's Brotherhood" may return to the new composition.
He was a member of the ONC for three years, but never visited the prisoners.
Borstev believes that the forces, by appointing their chairman, will be able to make human rights defenders unbearable, so human rights defenders do not rule out a collective exit from the commission.
In their view, the promotion of force forces is coordinated by an NGO member Anton Cvetkov, the leader of the Russian Officers, an organization that advocates the interests of the forces.
"I don't eat the babies on the tape," said the RBK Daily Anton Cvetkov.
He denied that he was lobbying for the promotion of any lists and said that he was not going to prevent human rights defenders from visiting the arrested opponents.
According to Cvetkova, he was not even interested in what list they are now voting in the O.P.
The publication of Borsh information is considered as a form of pressure.
Possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change in leadership of the Chilean UN.
Its former leaders will be removed due to last year's dignitaries.
In the Public Chamber, it was concluded that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of prisoners.
And here's the Rostova-na-Donu ONC can move from human rights defenders to the forces.
From the new lists, the human rights defender-president of the local commission has become one of his opponents, although in May 2013, the Federal Public Court ruled him out for non-ethical conduct.
The lists of Moscow and Growth Commissions in Borstev are considered to be "a place for Kopeysk".
The announcements of the Tolokonnik Hope did not affect the UNO Mordov, which they considered to be “strong”: the new entity wanted to become only one human rights defender, and it did not even adopt documents for the competition.
A member of the OP Council, Nikolai Swanidze, told the RBK daily that he voted against the proposed list, as he was reparated by the situation in Moscow and Rostové-na-Donu.
He sent his position to other members of the council.
His colleague on OP Pavel Gusev said he was voting for, because he liked the proposed Moscow list.
He co-ordinated the development of UNC lists by the Deputy Secretary of OP Vladimir Grib, also a staff member of the FSIIN Research Institute.
The Grib told the RBK Daily that he did not consider it appropriate to divide candidates for human rights defenders and silhouettes and did not agree with the fact that the chairman of the commissions had sufficient authority to prevent the work of its members.
The summit should not predict the outcome of the vote of the Board of Appeal.
If the proposed list is rejected today, a change will be made in the next few days.
Australian woman appeals against the prison term in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney sentenced to 15 prison sentences on the island of Phuket for a false claim that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed to a sentence and was released under bail.
Steve Bemford was initially recognized by the Phuket Provincial Court on 15 June as guilty of a false charge after the Thai police reported that a local taxi driver had attacked the night on Sunday, 10 June, while two other men had held her.
However, the video surveillance camera later found that she had returned to her hotel well after breaking up her relationship with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phucket police interrogated Bemford for two days before she recognized that she had made this story.
Before the trial, she was held in local police chambers.
Bemford was sentenced to a 15-day prison term in the general prison in the province of Phuketa, not in the adult women ' s prison.
She is a daughter of the former Australian League of Peter Tanx, who has applied to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra for assistance to her daughter.
Tanks told Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “very concerned” with the well-being of their daughter and was waiting for her return to Australia.
“It was obviously an alarming time, but we hope that she will return home as soon as possible,” Tanks said.
Bemford appealed to his sentence and was released on bail in 50,000 B.C.E.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently vacationing in the Krabi resort in southern Thailand.
The legal sources in Thailand reported that Bémford was currently a local lawyer in Phukete, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in its sentence for two years and make it a prison term for adults.
However, after the recent murder of Australian tourist Michel Smith in Phukete Thailand, he could also seek to restore his debased tourist image, which would lead to a just sentence.
Roman Senchin is now in Paris at the presentation of his Roman "Eltishev", translated into French.
Remember, that's exactly what his novel became the finalist of the four prizes: "The Clear Pole", "Russian Booker", "National Bestseller" and "The Big Book".
Last year, the author of the book was awarded the prize for the Russian Federation's cultural government.
Roman Senchin is an undisputed leader in the generation of current 30-year-old and forty-year-old proselytes.
In practice, each publication of its hard work on contemporary life stories and stories has caused heated disputes among critics of the most diverse ways.
It can be claimed that the joint articles on the Prose and Publicism of Senčina, reviews of its books and journals create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the end of the 1990s to the beginning of 2010.
In the discussions on the “one of the most controversial contemporary writers,” the critic Sergei Chuprinnin said, it is mostly said that its participants understand the word “literacy” as they see the present and the future not only of our vocabulary but also of our lives.
Regrettably, the volume of books did not include most articles and reviews from regional media and blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are usually given in reductions in the section “Abses...”
