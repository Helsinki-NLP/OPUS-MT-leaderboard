Parliament does not support the amendment granting the freedom of Timothy
Today, in amending the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Ukrainian Parliament rejected an attempt to abolish an article that condemned opposition leader, Julia Timoshenko.
The amendment, which would lead to the release of the former Prime Minister ' s prison, was rejected during the second reading of the draft law on reducing sentences for economic offences.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was considered unfavourable.
The sentence is not yet final; the court will consider the appeal of Timoshenko in December.
Timoshenko claims that the sentence is the political place of the regime; the process has also been suspected in advance in the West.
The proposal to repeal Article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, under which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes.
Libya's Victory
In the history of liberation, or resurrection, Libya has already lost.
Muammar Kaddafi was buried somewhere in the desert without him.
It's time to identify the winners.
Islamists are usually victorious in the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself a follower of the ordinary Sharia law, which we have heard about.
Libya will become a crime-free country, as the punishment for theft is the cutting of hands.
Women may forget about emancipation; potential apostates will be punished; and so on.
Instead of the dictatorial society of rival clans, the Koran will be united.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and that we would hardly wish for.
In any case, our life pattern is not the only one in its own kind, nor is it better, and is likely not suitable for the people of Libya, for example.
In fact, it is amazing that the Islamic warriors have received help from unbelievers.
Their only justification is that they believe that NATO was led not by the American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they glorified after every impact.
And if Libya is looking for winners, the West is not among them.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam, and our policies were delivered from the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantees of benefit.
Given the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to renounce Libya's military occupation.
The local population does not need to worry about the expulsion of the crossbreeds.
Even if the oil companies are not occupied, will Libya's black gold be virtually worthless?
Probably won't, and then the West will eventually be able to stand up for the useless protection of civil rights.
Unless Sharia's followers put an end to this.
The New Wave of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe are currently focusing on investors.
The statistical storm passed over Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries have reported GDP data in 3 quarters.
Compared with the previous quarter, the Czech economy was stable, Germany and France showed growth.
Still, today's debt market beats records.
Investors are not only looking at Italy; they have now focused on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have published their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP increased by 0.5 per cent; France by 0.4 per cent.
Both countries have also adjusted the data for the second quarter, where the case was better than expected in Germany (growth of 0.3 per cent instead of original 0.1 per cent). France reported a slight decrease of 0.1 per cent (significant information expected stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary increase of 1.5 per cent.
However, compared with the previous quarter of GDP, the Czech Statistical Office confirmed the trend in the slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than the analysts predicted.
Key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary increase of 1.5 per cent; however, it remained stable compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany's economy rose by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
From July to September, both the Eurozone and the European Union have shown growth compared to the previous quarter by 0.2 per cent, which coincides with analytical forecasts.
Greece's economy showed a preliminary drop of 5.2 per cent.
Its 10-year-old bond income is 28.45 per cent.
Income from both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching a critical note.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are experiencing difficulties.
Although the situation in the region is deteriorating, the return on Czech 1-year bonds remains about 4 per cent.
In Germany, the ECB is the last creditor to save the situation.
The Czech Assembly has passed a team in EURO.
In Montenegro, they won the 1:0 and celebrated an unexpected cash prize of 200 million.
The national team has successfully managed the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Chechnya and the beautiful hill of Peter Iraček, they won the 1:0 account.
In the second time, the Czech team succeeded in maintaining a significant advantage after the home-responsible match, and it will again take part in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the match and made a detailed report.
Almost nothing remarkable in the first time and great success in the second.
The Czech National Assembly, partly due to the defeat of the team at the end; the Great Czech Republic; and the Heroic Iraq; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated the European Championship.
The supreme defense of the Czech team allowed the Montenegro team to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damyanovic and Vucinic became the most unsuccessful match ever after they lost two great opportunities.
Great Peter Chech is one of the reasons that the Czech national gathering will not miss the European Championship next year, and thus the Czech football will earn about 200 million Czech crowns.
From the first minute, the game was very tense.
Both teams had difficulty conducting combinations; most of the time the game went to the center of the field.
This also explains the lack of pressure on the first-time owners' team, and the further attacks on the defense line were accurately taken by the Czech defenders.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred university students have built a living shield around the nuclear power plant in Iran.
They therefore wish to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday afternoon for the students ’ prayers before entering the building, a prayer was followed for the death of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students have built a living shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
They thus demonstrated their willingness to protect their country ' s nuclear programme for their own lives.
In its last report, the International Agency for Nuclear Energy (IAEA) indicated that all demonstrated that Iran had not left an attempt to obtain nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon for the students’ prayers before entering the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant, both the United States and Israel were followed by a prayer of death.
In the event of an attack aimed at maximizing the Iranian nuclear programme, the Israeli press believes that the installation of both Isfahan and Natanza, where uranium enrichment is being carried out, will be the goal.
Question of children suffering from obesity: No breakfast and dinner sausage
More than one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 are subject to higher standards; while 9 per cent of schoolchildren are overweight, 5% suffer from obesity.
According to the latest study, children who suffer from obesity usually come from families who are not healthy.
We see again the importance of the environment and the models of conduct that accompany a person for his or her healthy development.
For example, collapses occur at the tables of children who suffer from obesity almost twice as often as in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of the children who suffer from obesity eat free potatoes before a survey of the educational event called the Osiris is not an accident.
Moreover, the families of children who suffer from obesity do not engage in sports, but most families of modern schoolchildren, only 15 per cent of them, have said that their parents find time for sports activities at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of last year’s training year, involving nearly 900 primary students throughout Bohemia.
The operation of Ozierje was not an accident during the second consecutive year, with the support of the insurance company General Health Insurance and Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 students from 4 to 8 classes have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and sufficient sports load are key determinants of the rapidly growing number of children suffering either from excessive weight or from obesity.
"For example, only half of the respondents said that they ate five times a day, under the breakfast-perekus-lanch-perekus-forekus-forekin scheme, because it is one of the essential conditions of proper nutrition," said one of the findings of the study.
No chain and no sausage for dinner.
Experts warn that healthy development is important even relative details such as regular family mornings.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 per cent of school families are leaving together.
In most families, everyone's having breakfast separately.
The sharpest opening was the fact that in every ten families, people do not have breakfast at all.
However, tomorrow is the basis for the right day-to-day management.
The study showed that burning food is used more often in families with children who suffer from obesity.
Almost every one, regardless of weight, drinks sweet drinks every day (70 per cent).
Although more than 40 per cent of children regularly engage in sports, this figure is reduced by more than two to 15 per cent when it comes to their parents.
Create your own menu.
In another part of the study for selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools), it was proposed to draw up their own menu based on the products proposed and based on their tastes and preferences.
"The preference of Czech children aged 12-15 is far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
Their favorite food includes a large number of painful, meaty, and sweet foods.
"The particular concern is caused by the high popularity of sweet-frozen drinks," says the final part of the study.
As the main eaten meal, the shepherd beat the bird with a little overhang.
However, children had virtually no interest in bees, fish, and vegetables.
Stimulating a Healthy Picture of Life
The study also showed that children are willing to change their eating habits, provided that the relevant information is provided to them.
“Many participants in the study control group have shown a significant increase in the preference for healthy food when they completed the survey after the completion of the lesson, Ozierje is not an accident,” the project said.
This was particularly noticeable, for example, in the case of sweet chills, more children have become more like just water.
In addition, as a primary concern, children were more likely to note birds and fish, limiting the number of sweet meals and meals.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, according to professionals
In the first article on stylistic training, I visited information at introductory sessions.
I had no idea what was going to happen.
Three experts' lessons in this area; advice on choosing clothing for non-standard figures; and a seminar on how all of this works in real life.
Go on, go on, go on.
The closer we are to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks we are expected to be.
Training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it's really busy with information.
This time we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not ideally symmetric.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
In one short neck, in the other little figure without proper shapes, another weight is more normal.
The stylist should know how to significantly reduce the width of his shoulders, lengthen his neck or add the missing volumes.
We've been given advice on how to highlight the figure of women like Jennifer Lopez, that is, the owners of a thicker chest and a softer waist, and not to wear them too challenging.
For example, if the difference in size and size of the waist is so great that you cannot improve your waist or ankles, you should have at least one thing to order.
You're obviously not sorry for the money you've invested, because perfectly sitting clothes are worthless.
In the jube, you will feel much better than in the one who constantly moves, caresss, and so on.
Small figures may, on the other hand, wear clothes with rags, application, embroidery or storage.
Taking into account the abundance of information and the types of figures, I'm glad I've had a whole week to realize.
And yet, I'm afraid that's too much, given the homework we've got.
Each participant had to think of two things in order to be famous: day and night.
We must take into account their modern appearance, their style in clothes and the type of figure.
I have to wear Miranda Kerr, which you can know about Victoria's Secret advertising campaigns.
I'm happy about myself because it's much simpler to wear than, say, Britney Spears, Christina Agiler, who has recently recovered to a tone (please, be aware that I'm being exaggerated) or quite a young Selena Gomes.
We need to cut off the journals or find it online, print and process using graphic programs.
Mudbord - the result of the work - then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphic image.
It's important to keep a graphic style in mind.
The stylist does not simply dress real people, but creates product pages in journals (based on special instructions such as fashion bags, coat, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Kamenik told us about.
But it was only on Sunday.
The Styleist Needs Common Knowledge
The Saturday lecture, filled with information on the types of figures, has brought three specialists to life in this area.
Stylist, Honza Podorna; fashion designer, Jacob Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should use this fact.
A good stylist is able to use one object of clothing differently.
In this case, diversity is key to success.
For example, the suit can be worn in a normal way, on the gins and football as a coat; but it can also be worn on the naked body, without any marks, as a salary.
Another option is to hit the sleeve or lift the collar, and the whole image changes completely.
"Play with him," he stressed.
Anyway, I most appreciated the following advice: "You must know the rules perfectly for your work."
Then you can start breaking them," Jacob told us.
Here I finally realized why we're getting all the definitions and rules that match what and why, while we often see each other in modern journals.
I'm not talking about fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I learned that a stylist must have more options in order than the number of photos he needs to take.
So for a fashion review on ten pages (equivalent to ten in pairs) I have to be ready to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that in the picture the subject of clothing often looks and works in conjunction with others rather than in reality.
We must have that in mind when we create an image.
Honza Pokorna confirmed that the image and style are often half successful.
Just look at Madonna, who does not have a striking ring, but her image and marketing have turned her into a world star.
The treatment of stylish services in the Czech Republic is still quite cold.
Even famous people often think it too much (and believe that it is enough to be a specialist in something, and what they look like is secondary).
And if someone finally allows us to create their style, we have to wait for them to call us a different size than what they really are.
Then we're going to Google and we're going to find out if we've written tabloids anything about the fact that there's something familiar about the floor/flood, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario stressed that for the stylist, it was not enough to be in fashion and be able to improve at the same time.
Our work is primarily about communicating with the people we wear; therefore, it is important to be a good psychologist.
In order to be able to appreciate people, not to shape them, and to stick to their views.
"If the manager asks you to look at her clothes and add some beautiful things, you can't throw out her entire wardrobe, you tell her that her clothes are awful."
"Find at least a few things you can praise, and advise what you can carry with them," says Mario.
He also showed us that the work bag should be specifically mixed.
It's a bag you tie around the waist to carry everything you need.
In addition to obvious things, such as knives, adhesives or English beads, it should be a nylon thread (stylers use it when collecting some items such as bag or stick), special clips to strengthen back tissues if it wears too large (paints and similar items are prohibited because they wear clothes) or a set of hair.
To get away from the lectures and to have some practical experience, we learned to do the right stuff on the shoe.
Even during a survey in a studio where half smooth, the staff can get damage - not about a survey on the street.
And that's what we did with the curse.
You don't have to deal with a shoe with knives to keep them out of the way.
This requires the present skill.
I was glad that Mario praised my work.
Those skills didn't touch my soul.
It's just part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend course.
I'm starting to understand that being a professional stylist isn't as easy as they say.
V Need for Speed: Escape takes place in America.
Overview
What must have been a jobless walk has become a routine morning trip to work due to a series of completely inappropriate and unnecessary mistakes.
The ambitions were to some extent satisfied, but it was not important, since no one obviously wanted to do more work.
Before the release of the new version with the sub-heading "Peerg" we had high hopes.
It was expected that it would move the previous series of Need For Speed in a new direction; demonstration versions showed that the game would take a decent place in the genre of game gonorrhea.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the main hero came out of the car and ran.
As it often happens with NFS, it's very different from what we expected.
The game is a rather minor arcade race, but the general impression is that there are several unnecessary errors that have been present in this series of games for several years.
And that means, in fact, it's not a mistake, it's an unexplained developmental line.
The adventure is starting very well.
You're part of a story that Jack, the main hero, has decided to solve some personal problems through the involvement in an illegal race through America.
You're sitting in a car on the west coast of San Francisco, and your mission is to get to New York first.
This idea has several interesting features.
The route consists of ten stages separated by more than fifty rounds.
This means that each race goes on its own route, the individual stages go on in a diverse and interesting environment.
So there's no feeling that the game is always the same.
Although the schedule is at the same level as in the previous parts of the series, some tracks are pleasant to watch.
Still, the game does not produce strong emotions.
Although driving through the desert, on autumn grounds, or high in snowy mountains, it is very pleasant to drive.
In addition, racing from time to time will bring an extraordinary detail to life.
For example, in the desert, you fall into a sandstorm, which significantly diminishes visibility.
On the other hand, the mountains need to be careful not to fall under the lava.
Individual races are pretty well arranged.
There's only a few variations, but that's enough.
Sometime you're trying to get a few competitors (in essence a normal race); then you're trying to improve the time (the standard race with a second) or you're fighting one opponent.
Besides, from time to time, you've come to the police, which makes your task even more difficult.
The components outside the car are new.
It's just an interactive animation, where most of Jack's time is running away from someone and you have to help him with the buttons he needs at the right time.
It's nothing complicated.
Although it's amazing that these fragments are much less than you could expect (all three to be accurate).
In fact, it turns out that it is good for the game because it does not have to be; given all the above, it is one of the things that make the game more busy.
The gonorrhea model follows previous models.
This means that it is no longer something special, but it cannot be considered a deficiency.
If you're looking for real life imitations, you're going to have to find another place.
However, this driving model is very suitable for dynamic chases, although better options can be found on the market.
It's all right.
However, some time has passed since problems began.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not so good.
You don't expect such a game to be complicated changes and collisions, but if you don't have the idea of a collision with an object, how your car will behave, something's wrong.
Usually, when you drive or drive past a car in a flat stream, you sometimes have a hard time referring to another car, but sometimes in a similar situation, your car is starting to break up.
Or he broke up.
This is not so important because of the restarting system, but it is enough to make fun.
Restarts are arranged so that if you break or walk away from the tracks, the game will bring you back to the point where it stopped.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you use them all, you'll have to start the race from the very beginning.
It's useful if something doesn't work, but you can't rely on it completely.
Sometimes restarting is not enough, and you have to learn to run a separate race.
An important lack of play is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some rotations need to be done in a certain way, otherwise you just don't write down.
In other cases, you meet civilian cars in a particular location in the same configuration, regardless of whether you come first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This particularly upsets situations when you see your opponent passing easily between two machines moving in the opposite direction, while when you're there, the machines are already in place so you need to either drive them or drop them.
It does not matter when you approach them; everything is arranged so that the situation always happens just before your nose.
The rivals have other advantages.
During the game you find several places where, regardless of the time, the same rival is driving you in the same place.
This is especially evident at the end of the game, on the long bridge where you go in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent has to stand before you in spite of anything.
The thing is, when he walks in front of you, he's making it worse for you, causing one or more accidents on this site.
You can understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and full of adrenaline, but it's so obvious that it's starting to get upset fast.
Unfortunately, because despite a simple driving model, the game is busy and sometimes so busy with events that you don't have time to pay attention to what's happening around you.
It doesn't matter what doesn't let you miss - a concept with fifty unique trails, the sequence of chases or something else.
The idea of changing cars during the chase is unusual.
You need to track the trucks on the way, because that's what your car can change on them, even though in most cases you already have enough.
The machines are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are approaching cities; powerful American cars are for direct cut-offs; and exotic super-sports for technical driving, for example, on the high road.
The main story mode mode is closely related to challenging mode mode; it is race on individual sites that you will know in the course of the game.
Here you win for your personal business, both medals and eyes, common for challenging regimes and stories.
Many possibilities are available for a higher level of driving: starting from cars and closing the profile data.
In addition, the profile relates to the online Autolog function, which compares, among other things, the results you have achieved with the results of other players and provides a link to the public.
Here is another flaw that is hard to understand; this is an example of the last race in sequence.
You and your car fall into the subway tunnel (let's say so) where you lean on the tracks in the dark (let's say so).
Your speedometer shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (we'd think so) when suddenly you get hit by a subway train turning your car into a metal chest.
For a few days, our editor discussed whether it was true that no one thought for a second at the time of the game, or that its creators really considered us to be such torments.
The technical composition of the game is nothing special; but the overall impression from the video set is most pleasant, sometimes even surprising.
Although, in some critical moments, the quality of the record is sometimes rather severe, it is reduced.
This is particularly true of events with a large number of participants, where a good record would not help you in particular.
Sound's fine; soundtrack's on the lover.
In order to satisfy the widest possible young audience, the soundtrack 'extremes from different styles', but hardly many people buy the game because of its music.
General impression of Need for Speed: escaped rather indisputable.
If the game avoided clearly unnecessary errors, we could honestly say that Rung is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
In any case, the game leaves a sense of infinity.
Of course, it's a good time, but get ready to be blinded by the lack of it as an airport searcher.
The Karlova University will attend the "Students in Barrhatt" concert.
The Festival Festa Academy, the third consecutive year, proposes to unite the international student's day and anniversary of the barrage revolution with the musical event.
He will present about twenty school and university choirs.
The main event of the festival is two concerts held on 17 November.
"Carlow University is actively participating in the festival."
"The summits include the Hor of the Faculty of Education and Humanitarian Sciences; Vaclav Gample, the Rector, will enter the committee," said Jacob Chalun, head of the organizational committee.
The culmination will be a free public concert of school choirs, which will take place on 2 November 17th in front of the National Technical Library in Davica.
The production of jazz meat, the making of a famous Czech jazzman, Karela Ružići, is also part of the programme.
In the evening, the "Students in Barhata" will be held at the official National House in Vinograd, with the participation of the choirs of universities, including the choirs of Karlova University.
The goal of Festa Academy is to celebrate the International Student's Day and to celebrate the 22nd anniversary of the Barhat Revolution; and to present to the public a high-quality choir music and to develop creative collaboration among young people.
The main organizer is the Czech singing groups (Czech choirs) in cooperation with the secondary school called Johann Kepler.
All events take place with the help of the Dioslava Freedom, Lord-Major Prague, and Vaclav Gampla, rector of Karlova University.
The festival will take place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubice.
The programme offers both formal concerts and numerous music meetings, student hipping, day shows, etc.

Ambassador to the EU of Vicenova:
The Czech reputation of beneficiaries and skeptics vis-à-vis the euro.
"The Lisbon Treaty has caused considerable differences between individual organizations."
"I didn't expect such a cruel war."
"It takes five or six years before the situation is stabilized, calmed, and all the players are used to their new role," EU Ambassador Milena Wizenova began his lecture in law school.
She demonstrated how well she adhered to her “Clearly and openly about Europe” motto in the very first part of her lecture, where she described individual EU institutions and their relations so simple and understandable that many of the lecturers from the law school would be jealous.
Moreover, Vicenova praised the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompey:
"The critics at first said that he was a regular serial office mouse that can't play any role; I have to say, everyone has been touched by how well he has dealt with his role."
"The person who can listen at the same time to twenty-seven participating countries have a good relationship with them and who has a clear idea of which side the EU needs to develop."
She explained her new post on international relations and security issues as an answer to the question, "Who is the European Union? What number do I need to call?", i.e. how important is the Union's policy of unification and greater transparency with regard to countries such as China or India.
No one's going to ban our sires.
The evaluation continued to focus on a programme that is key to the EU in the past, the present and the near future.
She called the Czech Presidency a success last year.
The Czechs have dealt with the pressing financial crisis; they have overcome the crisis and organized the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She said that the resignation of the Government at the time had been a negative phenomenon that had done little harm to the Czech Republic.
The Czechs are now very busy in the EU.
As the Ambassador said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis were causing the ongoing confusion.
It is also necessary to adopt a new seven-year EU budget, which is very straightforward in view of the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be poor and economical, what areas will be preferred; which countries will receive more support and which will be smaller; all these issues will be in the future programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans she brought to Brussels: "About Europe, the Language of Understanding".
"I really don't like reductions, foreign words and jargon, which no one understands.
How citizens can understand that people in Brussels are not trying to sell curves or round corners, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our cheese varieties.'
It is also intended to make more effective use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs to European organizations.
Multi-speed Europe - our future
The Ambassador claims that the Czechs are considered Euro-Skeptics; as well as people who note rather negative rather than positive aspects of the matter.
She wants more representatives of the Czech Republic to be involved in European organizations.
She believed that there were several factors involved: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivation letters; and, at the same time, little support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it noted the power and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and we join the word, the French next to me says, "Hey, what about the assembly again, the Upper Graduation Group?" and he doesn't like the hats.
In the future, the Union of Vizenova is expecting a largely new set of rules for the budgetary policies of the States parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considers the idea of two-speed unless a multi-speed Europe is more realistic.
"We have both countries inside and outside the Eurozone."
"We have a Schengen area, and we already have an institution for enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that those countries that wanted should be united, while those who did not want could remain on the side."
"The number of such institutions will grow; it will be a two-speed Europe," Vizenova expects.
In this regard, it stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompey in advancing the rule that all issues relating to the EU as a whole should be discussed by all the countries involved, not only in the Eurozone.
Brand history:
The novelty of IBM enters the second century of its existence.
If anyone wants to find a word that best expresses the IMB strategy, probably the closest one will be "long-lasting."
For the general public IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered to be very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The company's longevity was laid by its first boss, dreamer Thomas J. Watson-old.
He believed in his motto that many of the world’s problems could easily be solved if people wanted to think.
His slogan "Dumai!" thus became a printing press about which the life of the future giant was being developed (and also called his internal magazine, which IMB began publishing in 1935).
More than that, it was the foundation of a corporate culture that Watson had carefully worked out.
"For us in IBM, long-term thinking means a constant movement to the future.
IBM survived and flourished for a hundred years because he remained faithful to his original values, although he was not afraid to change everything around him.
In our first hundred years, it has allowed us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years, we hope to achieve even more," said the current manager of Samuel J. Palmizano on the anniversary.
Complex system
In the 1930s, Watson came to the issue of employee concerns, like Batya in the Czech Republic, IMB staff were one of the first American employees with paid leave, employer insurance, elegant uniform and complex bonus system for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
The same advances are long-term IBM relations with consumers.
From the very beginning, the company has had a brilliant application of talented people, one of the first world companies to eliminate all discrimination, which has given it a great choice.
It is in line with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan whereby the woman, Virginia Romatti, will change Palmizano next year.
She worked in IBM for thirty years; she is currently the sales, marketing and development director.
For the past few years IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorms, where many future innovations occur.
It's not surprising that the idea of a lot of people working in a company is about half a million people.
Organization with a good reputation
The strong position of the company in the business is ensured by a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM concept was rather an organization rather than a technology company," said Professor of Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM Rosabet Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company, it's a company that helps solve business issues using technology," adds George Colony from Forrester Research consulting company.
As they say in the company itself, there is a difference between going to the market and creating it.
In a hundred years, IBM, or the Blue Giant, as it is called in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems that it is the most universal technology company, which develops hardware and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services, from servers to nanotechnology.
It has the largest number of patents among all American technology companies, five of which received the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, a ATM, a bank card, a financial soup, a bar code and a discette.
With $220 billion, according to market capitalization, IBM has become the second largest technology company in this year (the first place in Apple) and has been inspired by Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Look ahead
Not all of its products came to the taste of buyers and entered the era. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; online service Prodigy and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is defined as moving forward, you cannot be emotionally attached to the past," says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That's why IBM easily lays the foundation on several platforms - if they don't work, it refuses to.
This differs, for example, from its Microsoft competitor, who is based and experienced the fall on Windows, its operating system.
Perspective technology
The main revenues of IBM are from services, approximately one fifth in each case comes from computer programs and hardware.
As in 1990, with double capital, it was the strongest equipment company.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets of $15 billion, while at the same time investing 58 billion in the purchase of forward-looking technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis was the first time it hit the world.
IBM is an example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who has increased investment in the years of the Great Depression.
Until now, IBM seems to have done no harm to the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the price of IBM shares has increased by 120 per cent; the company's net earnings have increased steadily.
The corporate currency of IBM is to change everything but its own values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if another crisis occurs, this flexible giant will deal with the situation.
History of IBM: from raw knife to space flights.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago. Its original title, "Corporate, Tabulation, Records" was quite complex.
She named it IBM in 1924, originally called the brand used for company offices in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the future IBM was a merger of four companies, whose history began in the 1880s.
They had technology, such as the legendary "table hours", i.e. the fixed times when staff members came and left work.
The new company's architect was businessman Charles Ranlet Flint, who also led the company's board of supervisors until 1930.
Flint hired a company director, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then dismissed the founder of IBM in the shade - Watson's ideas remain the basis for unscrupulous corporate culture and individuality.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as clear from the name, beginning with the production and sale of various equipment for business - from raw knives and meat off to cash machines.
For the first four years, Watson’s leadership doubled to $9 million, and the company’s expansion to all continents began.
Watson became so important to the company that almost forty years later his place in the director's chair took his son, Thomas Watson-younger.
Under his leadership IBM began developing artificial intelligence technologies and established the first language of programming.
In 1960, both IBM staff and computers helped NASA control space flights -- on Mercury, Saturn -- and in 1969 -- human flights to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - IBM line System/360.
The classic PC, which established computer standards at that time, called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
20 years later, IBM sold the Chinese company's computers to Lenovo, while purchasing the PricewaterhouseCoopers consulting office, thus focusing fully on consulting and high-cost services.
In the last three years IBM has made great progress with its concept of the Smarter Planet.
Its objective is to make good use of technology in areas where it has not yet been planned and to improve the road situation and urban management.
In the area of trade, IBM recently introduced a Smarter Trade platform that helps business to control the entire trade cycle.
IBM traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country in central and eastern Europe, IBM established its office in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ is also managing the strategic offshore centre in Brno.
The headquarters of Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, where the World-level Research Group is also working.
Retirement about her unfaithful husband:
I don't need it anymore!
Darina Richtaržova (53) said it was over!
After her husband, Joseph Richgarz (53), became a bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartošov (45), Darina still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
However, she no longer wanted to wait, and she marked clear rules for her future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner anymore," Richtaržov explained.
When Darina Richtaržov gave her blood to Bartošov’s house in summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
And although she had Yvette leave Rzycan 30 days later, Pepa did not leave the singer.
Moreover, he publicly acknowledged his love for her.
After a while, Darina gave up, making it appear that she had calmed down with a Roman husband; and now she has finally forgiven him.
I don't care who his wife's sleeping with.
Even if Rihtarze and Bartošov were ever to break up, his wife would not accept him with scattered hugs.
"He's the biological father of my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will drive him away."
"He will end his days, not as my beloved, lost and found old fool, but the man with whom I am bound," Richtaržov said, adding that she has already been freed from her husband and insists only on mutual appearances.
Joseph had nothing to do with his wife rejecting him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Yvette, I'm not going to change it."
"My wife decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision."
"Our union continues to function; I'm responsible for repair, garden, house and shopping."
"Darina and I are perfectly normal, but we don't share the bed anymore," Richtarz told Blesk magazine.
He claims that if Richtaržova finds new love, he won't stop her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who and if she has a friend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Yvette, and I bear full responsibility," Joseph concluded.
Mature women: Do they come to you from behind your backs?
When you ask men to call some typical bad women habits, they usually immediately list them all.
Dear ladies, do you know yourself in the following lines that describe several female habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Your second half complains that you're constantly going to the shops?
You need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like shopping for big sales?
If so, your shopping can be considered a stupid habit.
Some women admit that they need to control their passion for shopping.
So which of you will give up a walk around the store in search of perfect sitting clothes and examples of it (if you like, in different color options) in sample?
Maybe shopping is a hobby for most women, but for men it can be a real hell.
Just remember how many times you said your second half was waiting for you outside...
Everlasting Dissatisfaction
"I'm too fat?"
"I need to drop at least five pounds -- maybe I should start doing gymnastics?"
"You're still drawing on me?"
Do you know these phrases?
Yeah?
Then you join a group of women who are confused in their appearance.
Not that you need to stop following yourself, but many men literally have an allergy to the constant complaints of partners in their appearance.
The strong gender also agrees that the more often such complaints occur, the more women make them upset.
The Most Important Order and Cleanliness
It's like an endless story.
Mother's glass, chicken cleaning, mother's sex, dusting, cleaning the bathroom - at least twice a week.
You're criticizing your partner for coming up with a clean café in dirty bottles; children for scratching in a clean closet and fingerprinting their fingers on a window window in a hotel that was so difficult to clean?
If you are suffering from this "turn away", try to realize that it is extremely bad; and that in your family order and purity should not be at the top.
Free desire for cleanliness can threaten your relationships as well as your entire family.
Ordering intent
"Put the white in the basket."
"Are you going to put on dirty legs tomorrow?"
"The open seams for vessels should not be on the floor."
If you make your partner’s comments several times a day, he may feel that this is very offensive.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men understood that, women wouldn't have to command them so often...
Shuffles
Some women like to gossip, insult, and get intrigue against others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, who, and why.
From time to time, I guess, each of us has been breaking up.
Let's be honest, that's what the nature of all women is.
In any case, there are more serious offenders, women who often gossip and despise others, and they, especially in the women's working group, pose a major danger to their environment.
Jagra and Voraček’s successful transmissions helped Philadelphia win
During the Battle of NHL on Monday, two successful transmissions of the hockey attacker Jaromir Yagra helped Philadelphia to win 5:3 on Karolina's ice. He again became the most effective Czech fighter.
In both cases, Claude Ghiru used the experience of a thirty - nine - year - old star; he added another transmission and was declared the best player.
Two successful match transfers also belonged to a player in one team with Yagre Jacubu Voraček.
After the match, Yagre told foreign journalists that he had predicted a wonderful evening for the jury.
"I told him before the match he'd forget the het-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel things like that," Yagger explained, after which the jury shot the goal at the first opportunity that Fliers gave.
A little later, the second goal of the team also had a "cheese trail".
The closing Harrikeins Voraček took over the Shiboi and handed it over to Maxima Talbot, who killed between the circles.
In a second until the first break of the home game Patrick Dwyer reduced the break with a number of advantages, but at the beginning of the second time, Flyers was again taken.
Especially the jury.
After his successful delivery, Yagra killed the third goal, and later his strike was turned into the fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
"I like playing with him."
"I don't mean to say that he's the best league game, but he's exactly in three of the best," said Jagr, complimenting his center.
"I never thought at the end of my career I'd play with a hockey player like him."
"It makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in the NHL, my teammates have been trying to help me, and now my turn has come," Jagr added.
Caroline made the game more dramatic with the help of Tuomo Routu and the Dwyer Penalties, reducing the gap to one goal.
The further complications prevented Matt Reid, who increased the gap to two points.
"Pronger worked well in our area."
"He hit the whistle, I hurried, and Reed went to the far end."
"I'm glad it worked," Voraček described his impression from the last goal of the match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to the first place at the Eastern Conference.
The protector of the Montreal Czech team Yaroslav Špacek did not complete the match with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to the trauma of the upper body.
Together with an experienced Canadian defender, they lost their two-eye advantage and lost 2:3 after a series of penances.
Tomash the Pleccanist couldn't kill during one of their attacks.
More than lost eyes, the home coach was distressed by the large number of injuries in the rear row, as the match ended with only five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
"We ended the match with only one experienced player, the others were young people."
"No matter what, we can't do anything about it, we just need to calm down," said Jacques Martin.
"In exchange for replacement, it was devastating and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move the shib from our zone."
"What was our weak side," added Prosthetic P.K.Suban
After thirty attacks by Czech golfer Onjay Pavelec helped Winnipeg defeat Tampa Bay 5:2.
The Golls, who stopped the five-year series of injuries, were killed by five different players.
Price dynamics for travel since 1989
By 1989 only five public tourism agencies were able to work in the former Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
Since travel to the West was severely restricted, tourism agencies at the time sold tours mainly to the socialist bloc countries.
Thus, Czech tourists traveled to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime returned to the West, resulting in considerable restrictions on Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
A major paradox of the socialist period was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed to travel individually through socialist countries.
If a national of Czechoslovakia wanted to go on his own, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter of invitation was needed from that country; a different individual journey was impossible.
At the time, tourist agencies offered trips to the West, but they had to either stand all night, with a sleeping bag, or have "good friends" in the agency.
And that wasn't all.
A currency permit was required to travel to the West, and it was not issued to politically untrustworthy people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czech currency was not freely converted; it was impossible to obtain money (Western currency) without a currency permit for a trip to the West.
Most of the time, the Czechs took their vacation home, which resulted in a large number of cats and summer homes, and this habit is still present today.
After 1989 tourism in the Czech Republic thus survived the current revolution.
While before 1989 the GDR or Bulgaria holiday was the culmination of our journeys, the Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations in countries around the world last year.
The great paradox, which we no longer realize, is that by 1989 we could not freely visit Croatia's most popular at present, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the very beginning of 1990, the need for visas in the neighbouring Western European countries had been lifted, and this was the beginning of a huge wave of short journeys mainly in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks couldn't get on their way to the West, and they all wanted to go there for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents, since their income at the time did not include a hotel or a guesthouse.
A typical feature of Czech tourism during that period was the desire to bring their own food (conservations, salads, etc.) to save money.
Another important moment is the introduction of a freely converted Czech crown, and after decades our tourists can finally buy the Western currency.
Our standard of living and average income grew, leading to another important situation around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has made it possible for tourism agencies to prepare regular flights carried out by charter airlines.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs did not need a visa to visit almost all developed world countries except the United States, which made our travels even easier.
The next major event in the history of post-revolution journeys took place in 2000, with the greatest demand leading to the historical first direct charter trip from the Czech Republic to the exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter travels have been made by Czech tourists to warm exotic countries, and this winter flight from the Czech Republic will take place on twelve exotic routes.
Currently, about 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
And another important event of this period, symbolizing our post-revolution development, took place in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States abolished the need for visas for Czech tourists, and our country has always joined the most developed countries.
For the first time in history in 2008, Czechs spent more than half their vacation abroad (50.3%); and for the first time in history they spent more than 15,000 kroner per person during vacation abroad, including their expenses in the assignment paragraph.
The general meeting must elect the President, the threat of the road is returned
There was no president for about five months in Czech football, and there was a risk that the successor Ivan Gashek, the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) would not be called even after another extraordinary general meeting to be held in Nimburg on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on what electoral rules to follow.
Without the vote, one of the three candidates will not begin.
Indregijk Rachel, Miroslav Pelta and Tomash Paclik want to lead Czech football.
Gaschek left his post in June, and he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead the football in the future.
However, Gašek's era re-loaded football between the two chambers of the association, which cannot elect one candidate.
This was clearly 16 September when a new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly had recently arrived at the Prague National House, Smichov, because the negotiations remained blocked, not only by the electoral procedure.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the general assembly, only legal representatives or officials to whom the mandate had been given.
Since then, it has been partially resolved through the recommendation of the State and the Law Institute that a delegation based on the powers conferred cannot be made possible.
Disputes concerning electoral rules, however, continue.
The Executive Board also did not help too much, although at its meetings, both ordinary and extraordinary, it was mainly concerned with this issue.
Opinions on voting methods have changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is, how do we get to the 3rd round and get out of the way?
“The challenge is whether to follow the established standards or to find another model,” said one of the vice presidents of FAČR Dushan Freedom, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
Based on the model provided for by the statute, the winner of the 3rd round is a candidate who has received considerable support from the chamber from which he is a candidate.
It is claimed that Moravia agrees with the compromise to consider the winner of the candidate ' s election with the highest number of votes cast in both Chambers.
The Czech side insists that the winner should vote at least two thirds in the overall percentage ratio.
"Nonetheless, the two previous rounds would have lost their meaning; it would have completely rejected the concept of the two chambers," Freedom agreed with Moravia's arguments, and he said that it would be better not to change the rules and vote in accordance with the existing rules.
A few unexpected agreements were reached by Thomas Paclik, although the electoral rules, as defined by the statute, were assessed by Pelta more than other candidates.
"I'd like the elections to go as far as the constitution is concerned."
"I want to avoid any reprehensible nonsense, as in the previous general assembly," said the owner of Victoria Plzehn, who was the first candidate; and in his statements he was largely opposed to Pelte.
The Pelta remains an optimist.
He believed that the new president would be known in Nimburg; he also hoped that candidates would work constructively in the future.
"All the emotional dissipation will be calmed after today's expected national summit in the European Championship."
"The football will again be in a happy mood, people will be more willing to cooperate," said the representative of Jablonac. He has three candidates with the most experience in football management at both the professional and regional levels.
Rachel's more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very different."
"This is not between the representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to adapt the rules deliberately."
"This could cause another collapse of the common congregation."
"I hope that a healthy sense will win," said Rachel.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some information, individual negotiations have taken place directly in Montenegro; but who knows whether a football match will be achieved.
The additional voyage, which had to be delivered, in addition to others, to Vice-Presidents Dalibor Doger and Reichla in Podgorica, did not depart from Prague in the morning due to technical inadequacies; they sought an alternative to deliver part of the executive committee to the place of re-playing.
At the end of the day, the meeting of the Minister, which is expected to take place in the middle of the day, could become crucial.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sport, Joseph Dobesh, would like the opponents of the country's strongest sports association to come to an agreement.
Much has been shown: government subsidies; football credit; and the planned general meeting of the Czech Sports Board following the financial problems of Sasska.
Paclik enters the presidential struggle because he does not see a suitable candidate
If, before the extraordinary general meeting, the leader of the Pulzn Tomash Paclik had seen a strong candidate who would meet all his requirements to the President of the Czech Republic Football Association (FAČR), he would not even claim a high position.
"If I were a worthy candidate, I would fight for him and not participate in the fight."
"But such a man has not yet been found," said Paclik CHK.
Paclica's motive for fighting Miroslav Pelt and Yindžich Rachel - to try to prevent Pelt, the alleged election favor, from entering FAČR.
Moreover, Paclik stresses that in the event of a victory, he will remain the President only until 2013, when a regular general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he would like this post to be held by an experienced top manager who was not too involved in football.
"I've talked to a few people that might be relevant."
"It was terrible to hear some of them say they don't even want to have a relationship with Czech football at the moment."
"I'd like to change that opinion," he said.
At present, the main dispute between Paclica and Pelta is related to the relations between the latter and Roman Berbro, president of the Pulsen Regional Football Association. Berber is a man of a controversial reputation known as an influential lobbyist who is able to influence the votes of delegates of the general congregation.
Paclik thus considered it unacceptable for Pelta to become president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged and football will not move forward."
"With Berbra's support, a capable businessman, it would be even more harmful for football," said Paclik.
He pointed out that several years ago, the name of Pelta was recorded during the hearing of the phones in the investigation of corruption; Pelte was able to avoid convictions.
"I don't know what reward Pelta's victory would bring for football."
"And as we would see in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, he now does not mention his previous statement that he is "selling the Plzen Club if Pelta becomes president."
If Paclik wins Thursday, he could present his cooperation with Pelt in the future.
This opinion is shared by another candidate, Rachel, whom Paclik supported before the September general meeting, which ended in Fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to be approached."
'He's very capable.'
"I can present it in the head of the collection."
"But he can't run an association."
"I don't have a nose in what I don't understand," said Paclik, who drew a lot of attention to himself in September, when he supported the removal of the judge's brigade led by Man Macel, whom Dagmar Damkov replaced.
Paclik argues that he will risk managing the association.
He referred to his experience in the management of private companies; since last summer, he has been running the Plzeň team, which with his help has distinguished his first triumph in the League in May.
"I have the strength to make the football environment change, to support its change to the best."
“Restricting the influence of some groups of people who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeals board, leading to reprehensible situations,” said Paclik. He did not hide his antipathy, for example, to the director of Sparta Daniel Krjetinski.
One of its priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which it will lobby at the highest political level to allocate more money to sport from lottery collections.
"This is one of the key points for the new president to take care of."
"If gambling is imposed by taxes, as political parties say, I understand their arguments, but they must state clearly where the money is going," he said.
Paclik does not consider his relationship to the Plzen Club as a burden, although he argues that President FAČR should be independent.
Pelta's connected to the Apples and Rachel's with the Prague Dock.
"This is not an ideal option."
"And yet I don't see the point in the hypocritical transfer of my shares to someone else's Plzeň club once I'm going back there six months later," said Paclik.
Pelta promised new FAČR rules to avoid the electoral path
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, he would fight for the new FAČR rules to avoid future electoral disputes.
Until Thursday's negotiations in Nimburg, the Jablonese official remains optimistic and believes that the attention from the pre-election struggle will make the expected success of our football team more tangible today.
Before the failed elections in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus both on the mission and on receiving funding.
He decided to participate in the election last moment before the last general meeting, so a two-month delay could be useful for him to resist his ideas about football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have long been in football, and they expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"They feel that it is now the time for someone to lead an association," said the man, mainly associated with the Jablonite club; but he spent many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the association.
This gives him reason to assume that he was experienced enough to manage Czech football.
He believed that the present problems were caused by the ephoria that reigned during the reign of Ivan Gashek.
"Unfortunately, the rules that were not so made, as we all thought, were adopted at the general assembly in June."
"If different methods of representation had not been adopted, we would have been president since September," Pelta said.
He referred to the census of the key document of the civil association as a false target for delegates.
"If I become president, I will consider it my personal task, and I will take personal responsibility if this attempt turns out to be unsuccessful."
"This is a fundamental question that we cannot exist without," says Pelta.
Besides, he says he's not trying to separate himself from the rivals.
In the past, he had already stated that he could present his cooperation with Yindhji Rachel, whom he appreciated as a legal education; he was fully aware of the fact that his opponent had to become his first vice-president.
For a long time, he did not attack Thomas Paccik, who was constantly criticizing Pelta.
"He's been on football for more than a year and has made some success."
"In any case, his attacks were inappropriate, and many people were surprised by the methods of his pre-election campaign."
"That's why some of them now doubt his true personality," said Pelta about his rival, and Pelta himself claims to be faithful to the declarations he made in September.
He considered his main weapons to be the knowledge of football, from competitions at the lowest level to national gathering.
The national collection should represent the whole football.
"I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the case of the goddesses or the consequences of the last year's corruption scandal."
"I would then focus on negotiations with both the private and the public sectors to guarantee sufficient money for the whole football," a forty-six-year-old candidate told the CTC two months ago.
He then promised that his election as a football leader would not lead to the dismissal of staff.
"I will need to know the official instructions of the individual staff." This was his message, which caused considerable nervousness during the extended period of inter-ownership.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios associated with the planned general meeting, he believed that delegates would not come to Nimburg directly on Thursday.
"If the only question is how to hold the third round, we can deal with it."
"The football needs the confidence he can get, just by choosing his leader," says Pelta, who remains an optimist two days before the key day of his career.
Rachel promises that FAČR will be active in his leadership
If the meeting on Thursday at Yindreji Reichl, the Vice-President, would become the President of the Czech Football Association, many in the Association would be disgruntled.
Rachel promises that if he is selected, a difficult time will come.
He wanted to establish changes in the system and make members of the executive committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to address the problem of the Goddess; to improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; to attract more money into football; and to continue the work of the previous president, Ivan Gashek.
"As President, I would like to focus on football in general."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to national gathering, professional football and youth football activities."
"That's why I don't want to say that I'm doing it on my own," Rachel said in her interview to the CZK.
"I am a command player, and I want to allocate powers to the executive committee so that each member will focus on a specific area."
"I have carefully assigned tasks so that in each of these segments, football will take major steps forward."
"This probably won't please many people because it will mean hard work, not just criticism of the work of others," he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement allegedly caused him to doubt his candidacy.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if there is any meaning in this; and that I will not be surrounded by people who put their fingers in my wheels and question my every step," he explained his doubts.
"Nonetheless, many people told me I shouldn't give up, otherwise others will come."
"It's trust I can't throw away," he said.
Moreover, he says that his motivation is to continue the work that he started with Gashek.
"A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to interrupt it all."
"There have been processes that can produce results a few years later, and I don't want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, would be elected, the situation in the Association could return to what was before the Gashek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's what Mirek Pelta is hardly competent to do."
"He's surrounded by people who play football so that it's only available to the chosen ones."
"I can be accused in a lot, but it's not about subjectivity anymore."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football available to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just a chosen minority," said Rachel.
Moreover, he denied the charge that he would only be President of the Czech Republic.
"Although many people are trying to assert otherwise, I plan to make the maximum for Moravia."
“For example, it is time to consider dividing the second league into the Czech and Moravian parts, whose winners would continue to fight in the first league.”
"This will prevent the current situation when there are only three Moravia teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," Rachel said.
While Plzeň Paclik's governing club entered the presidential struggle, Rachel was not reluctant to assess his chances of winning.
"Nonetheless, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as my vice-president, and I see that I have achieved some obvious success," said Rachel.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for not having unity in the association.
Assuming that Pelta was "exempted from the process of restoring Czech football's creditworthiness", he considers another rival, Paclica, a strong candidate who has something to offer.
"No one can doubt that he worked well in Plzen this year."
"If he is selected, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gashek started, without significant staffing changes in the committees."
"He wouldn't be disclosing the facts for his own benefit," said Rachel about his rival.

She was lying on her back in the water, looking up at the tastefully shaped dome, swimming on the marbled cherubs waiting for her at the end of the pool, and falling in love with carefully restored swimming pools in the ar-new style.
She hesitated to add each favorite pool to her notebook, with important details about the building and the history of the building.
The history of Meder's architecture has seen more than 200 swimming pools - and has now brought together the impressions in its recently published book Badefreuden (The Joy of the Cup), where everything came from the public pools in Munich to historic shopping gardens in the Black Forest and the "functional concrete buildings" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it visited the baths in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland, and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
46-year-old author is the present enthusiasm for buying culture.
She has very little enthusiasm for sports, says Meder, but in water everything else.
The only failure is that the swimmers must be content with the blue brown plate and the smell of chlorine, while the fugitives can breathe in the blizzardous smell of pine forests or listen to the joyful chirping of birds in the park.
"I once wondered why swimming pools should always be so horrible," says a woman living in Vienna.
"That's how I started collecting beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
Bathing in the pool and the oil found in the sauna is a healing factor in the baths, because in the opinion of Meder, all feelings are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be this pleasure for the eye if the builders take on such a job. "In place of sex in the pool you have the surface of water."
"The surface is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is visible: high floors, colour tiles and trampling.
The illustrated edition of The Joy of the Cup on 190 pages contains valuable information on the architectural and cultural history of the Oasis of Health - and it gives you the desire to dive into water.
The water collector Meder found several outstanding copies during the study in Hungary.
It has found rich nitrates in the Karst Cave (Mishkoltz-Tapolce) and thermal bath filled with water, in a building built in the form of a bottle (Vários Termálfürdö in Yasbren), as well as magnificent therapeutic baths, such as 100-year-old baths in Budapest.
Many of the heated open swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, have a stunning view. You can see all the Towers from the bathroom on the roof or consider the snowy Arlberg from the open swimming pool in St. Anthony, and there is a steaming window that lets you see what's happening on the bed.
Perhaps the most unusual design is waiting for swimmers in Langenfelde.
In winter, a pair of three open shells appear to be very small in the background of the Ectal Mountains.
Algambra in Schwarzvalde
The pool collection of Meder did not meet the smell of chlorine in each pool.
Many thermal baths smell a lot, and the baths of Arpada in Bekeshhab smell so much oil that you may find it hard to believe that you are in a healing source.
The smell causes hydrocarbons in the bloodstream. Water is almost black from the blood that clings to the skin as soon as you get into the pool, a health experience of a certain type.
At some point, however, Iris Meder was disappointed to find her beautiful bathrooms, and when she tried to visit the open pool of the Czech baths in Lugačović, she found that the territory was sealed.
The bathrooms designed by architect Dushan Yurkovic in 1902 were closed.
When Meder looked into the visible views of a red-and-white, ar-new-style building, she saw the sorcanoes growing between the brown tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was halted on hot tracks, the amazing swimming pool in Schwarzvalde, the Palace of thermal water in Bad Wildbad.
The Basins have already passed three construction stages. You will find not only the neo-Roman elements after the construction in 1844, but also the Mauritian Algambra-style hall, which was added about 1900.
After careful reconstruction in 1995, the thermal palace - a popular swimming pool swimming pool known as Irish Meder - was not just because it was born in Schwarzvald.
"This achievement is so masterful to combine such different architectural styles," says Meder.
Getting into the thermal pool in such a yard is obviously a secondary exercise.
Speculation of agricultural production
The Bank is investigating trade in agricultural products.
Christian Tivs
Will Doyce Bank stop trading agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Akkermann gave the working group the task of investigating the effects of speculation on the world's poor.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg-
According to one study, 84 per cent of Germans consider it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and maize.
Two thirds of the respondents demand that the Bank and other banks stop trade in agricultural products, as trade exacerbates the problems facing the poorest people around the world.
The findings were made in a study carried out by the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis of the Foodwatch Consumer Organization.
The study is based on the report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Garald Shuman, demonstrates that the world's commodity stock market rate is rising prices - and banks are thus engaged in global hunger.
The consumer protection campaign is directed directly against the head of Doice Bank Joseph Akkermann, although large banking houses, such as Godman Sax and Morgan Stanley, are trading the same.
Product prices were originally thought to be a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any case, the majority of experts now agree that the players have rejected the rules of the proposal and the demand - and are made available to the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Akkermann has responded to criticism, promising to investigate the charges and stating that no trade “is worth risking the good reputation of Doice Bank”.
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the accusations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year when the results will be submitted to the Board of Directors of the Doyce Bank, with recommendations for action.
The Bank ' s head then plans to announce the changes following the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods may decline or cease altogether.
Akkermann is working on his image.
President Foodwatch Tilo Bode was pleased with the news, stressing his critical attitude towards the financial sector. "The trend towards rising food prices is an example of how foolish banks are currently acting against common interests."
As the bank's chief lobbyist, Akkermann has a certain responsibility, in the opinion of Bode.
"The Bank's daughter must remove from the portfolio all investments that make money at food prices," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if it's about starving people or the daughter Bank's reputation."
Akkermann ' s rapid reaction at first was surprising, but in the meantime, the director wanted to have a clear image just a few months before his office was completed.
Ms. Bank announced on Monday that the chairman would not go to the monitoring board as planned.
The abolition of the speculative dispute in the food market could improve its image.
He also did not have to worry about the costs - with the consequences of his successor's case.
Each second would have refused to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, over 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization ' s campaign.
Bode published the study on Tuesday, and the study was conducted for the Institute of Social Research and Statistical Analysis Forsa 7 and 8 November, and 1001 attended.
Not more than eleven per cent believe that investments at the food price are acceptable to the Bank.
Many bank clients would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank was involved in such a trade; according to the study, each second would withdraw the contributions that ultimately result in product speculation.
43 per cent would recommend getting out of the bank, 49 per cent said they were thinking about closing the account and moving to another bank.
21st century house in Vienna
Pavilion in a New Place
Ingeborg Vinsovski
Architectural history, with its ups and downs and happy endings. The Pavilion of Austria won the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, became a museum in Vienna, was desolated and abandoned.
Now it's being reopened as an exhibition center.
The Pavilion of Austria, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a well-known example of modern post-war architecture with its simple glass halls that expressed faith in technical progress.
Pavilion Schwancera won Gran-pri by architecture in 1958 for his light silver construction of steel and glass.
The building is considered a hub in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built the pavilion of Austria at the next World Exhibition.
Finally, he celebrated the whole world in 1973 with his legendary four-cylinder BMW and her sister, a glass-shaped building.
Pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building, was transferred to the Swiss garden around the South Vienna Station, transformed and opened as the Museum of the 20th century in 1962, and is often referred to as the "House of the 20th century" for this reason.
In any case, the building did not approach the museum for technical and spatial reasons - it did not contain walls on which art could be hung and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna had received a new home.
The house has been deserted since 2001, and its condition has become worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Krishanitz has so far refurbished the pavilion, which was called the 21st century House, and will be used as a museum of contemporary art.
This museum is the Belveder Museum office, which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday evening, in all respects a happy event.
Agnes Husley-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belveder Gallery in 2007, contributed to a new start.
Huslin-Arco, a graduate of the Faculty of Art History with a brilliant youth figure career that worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and eventually became the founder and director of the Museum of Modernity in Zalzburg, convinced politicians and conservators to continue reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations, and decided on how the building would be used.
The new museum was to include the permanent exhibition of Fritz Votruba, coffee and bookstore along with contemporary art, as well as an office building.
Strict control & limited budget
Krishanitz was then an ideal candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, because of the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Session Joseph Olbrih, and won the competition, but he also studied at Schwanzer at the University of Technology in Vienna, and the pavilion was “an extremely important place” for him, where he attended the exhibitions “most every week”.
He knew the original design and the tasks that stood before the building, the building that had already lost some of its greatness and ease when it was moved to Vienna and transformed.
The problems that have arisen during the last restructuring were far more serious, and the idea was "energy absorber," Krishanitz says.
Window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, reinforced with a glass fibre safety glass was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced with a high-end safety glass.
The steel versions of the heat bridge were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the ceiling.
Two lower floors have created space for new use of the building, a falling light source between the building and the street provides lighting - almost a new building, but the Schwanzer Pavilion still stands out.
The original outer doors were preserved, and the building was decorated in the old red and brown colour of protection from corrosion.
Hall cinemateater is the same as it used to be.
All of this is under the strict control of the museum management and with a limited budget.
"We often had to find a material that was good, cheap and approved by the museum administration," Krishanitz says, pointing to an uneven style in the basement.
The building remained flexible and easy, despite constraints, problems and transformations.
Krishnitz recently noticed that the pavilion "from Brussels" was a rough story, typical of the chapels in the city.
Such an architecture is “not always in its place” and still wants to “stimulate the present awareness”.
The house of the 21st century is in a very right place, as the planning of the city has resulted in unexpected success. A fully-built “main station” with offices and real estate is growing around the Swiss Palace.
The house of the 21st century can be complemented by the second building of Krishanitz, the collector of Francesko von Gabsburg, acquired the Berlin Temporary Exhibition Hall and is reported to have been negotiating with the city on its location in the vicinity of the Swiss garden.
Deutsche Bahn is planning a multimillion-million-dollar anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn announced an anti-crisis plan to avoid the cancellation of winter trains.
The number of staff should be doubled.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million euros this year to avoid winter cancellations and delays.
Referring to the internal anti-crisis plan for Deutsche Bahn, Bild reported that by 2015 the total investment was planned at around 300 million euros.
Investments are designed to improve the efficiency of locomotives and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of personnel involved in snowflakes from roads and platforms will be increased by 2 to 16,000.
The aim is to clear the snow and ice platforms before the start of work and 90 per cent of the necessary shootings within four to five hours.
Rudiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of cancellation and delays of the winter train to meet with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced considerable difficulties in passenger transport, as it did not catch up with the reserves at the time of the deterioration of the weather conditions.
Many new regional trains of the years awaited the approval of the Federal Railway Service.
There have also been some delays in the provision of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check the ICE train axes much more over the years after one of the ICE trains broke off at the main station in Kelna.
Daughter Bank will pay millions of fines in the United States
The new challenges followed the riots around Joseph Akkermann, Director General Doice Bank: Doice Bank is threatened by a fine in the United States in many millions of pounds of sterling.
The recent industrial giant in the United States has been forced to face little of the family problem. The Bank, with its headquarters in Frankfurt, will pay $145 million (106 million) to settle disputes arising after bankruptcy during the financial crisis of the five largest credit unions.
The problem arose about the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Management of Credit Unions (NCUA), a financial market regulator, accused a number of major banks of using false promises to mislead credit unions to buy their financial products.
The value of bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and undermined credit unions below.
"We are pleased that we have solved this problem without referring the parties to the court," said the representative of Doice Bank in New York.
In the agreement, the bank did not accept its responsibility.
The same is true of Citigroup, who agreed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Mattz welcomed the operational response of both banks.
National Credit Unions Management (NCUA), is responsible for US credit unions and is involved in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer contributions.
NCUA is fighting for the compensation of losses resulting from the billions.
This is the first such agreement.
The Governor also drew attention to other major banks, and in the summer he launched a case against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Suspected mortgage bonds are so-called securities secured by a pool of mortgage loans.
They're backed up by internal loans.
This led to the fate of a number of financial companies, when the market for real estate in the United States collapsed in 2007.
The U.S. Investment Bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long time to live in September 2008 in the financial crisis.
A few years later, U.S. banks are still fighting the storm.
Investors and regulators have made a large number of claims, requiring compensation or punishment for fraud.
The Federal Housing Funding Agency (FHFA) is the largest claims of concern.
It charges the 18 largest international banks that they have acquired US credit organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac hostage agreements of approximately $200 billion.
The Bank's daughter is also facing a threat of prosecution by FHFA on numerous agreements of a total value of $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires the Frankfurt headquarters bank to assume responsibility for “substantial losses” but has not yet indicated the exact amount.
The Bank's daughter rejected the claims as unfounded and reported her intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffett invests 10 billion in IBM
Buffett's financial guru is actively investing in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has purchased shares of more than $10 billion.
So far, the largest American investor Warren Buffett has always stated that he does not invest in computers and IT companies because their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, IBM ' s annual report changed its view of investment in this sector.
According to Buffeta, he had to understand much earlier that IBM was primarily offering services and purchasing computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffeta's investment was estimated as a riscar.
IBM, an IT vet, has now received the title "Sir IBM".
In an interview with the American business channel CNBC Buffett reported that he had acquired IBM shares of a total of $10.7 billion in March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway was one of the largest holders of IBM shares of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said that even IBM had no knowledge of his involvement until recently.
He commended the management that had been able to arrive even during the financial crisis.
"They did a lot of work," said Buffett, referring to the management strategy.
A significant time has been focused on high-income IT services, such as data centres.
The founder of the computer industry, which has been offering software and advisory services for over 100 years, as well as powerful business computers.
Until now, Buffett's been running away from technology companies.
He claims he invests only in those companies he understands.
and invested, for example, in freight transport, in the manufacture of lubricants and machinery.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway has shares in the long list of major companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (former Municher Recht), as well as some 80 of its own subsidiaries.
At 81 years of age, he acquired a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway, in the 1960s, and built on it one of the most expensive companies in the world.
His life course, however, remained modest.
made it a cultural figure for countless investors all over the world.
His almost infallible instinct in making money brought him the Oracle of Omaha.
The price of IBM shares increased by one per cent before the opening of markets after Buffeta's investment announcement.
The Blue Giant, as IBM is still called, stands at the stock exchange of over 220 billion dollars, making it one of the most expensive high-tech companies in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, said he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Her founder Bill Gates is his close friend.
Unresolved risk
Following the discovery of the "sex in Vickau" Turkish media, they became suspicious of the law in Germany.
One of the newspapers spoke of "blood ideology", which is now being re-established on the surface.
The killings of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of the legal extremist ideology.
Fear and concern were the response to this communication in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community of Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has caused the long-lost fears of life. Such right-wing attacks on Turks have not since been on fire in Mellen in November 1992 and in Zolingen in May 1993.
There has never been any doubt, but there is a xenophobia in Germany.
However, the right extremist network now found is of such magnitude that it is not yet fully aware of it.
"Rebirth of blood ideology?" was the title of the internet version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret intelligence officer, and expresses concern that the German authorities might be involved in the right-wing regime.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) responded peacefully by referring to the victims of racial hatred by a silent picket opposite the Brandenburg Gate in these exits.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin at a ceremony involving German and Turkish politicians noted the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral employment agreement.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light, as a success story.
Some of the Turkish media reported as a waste. "A gift from Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of one of the articles on the "Haber X" Turkish web site, commenting on the circumstances of the series of murders.
The German edition Hürriyet also did not miss this parallel.
It's called the Ahmet Kulahji column.
He noted that people who paid taxes and their work had been killed had made a significant contribution to the transformation of Germany.
The conduct of the police and the successful follow-up were severely criticised by the German-Turkish Internet Forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not thought of following suspects in the right-wing circles before.
Some authors have come to a rather severe rhetoric. "If they continue to act as well, migrants will have no choice other than armed self-defence."
"This will be the best self-defense."
"The peace in Germany is very much dependent on how the entire network and the fairness of punishment will be covered," says Selen.
The crimes in Mellen and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example of the threat of peace in Germany.
The picture of burned ruins in Zolingen was deeply engraved in the memory of Germans and Turks.
No other event has shown to the Turks here so clearly that they are in danger, and to the Germans, that mistrust and equality can lead to real violence.
These crimes, however, increased the sense of unity among the Turks.
Do not repeat the previous error
At that time, the Turkish press condemned mainly the failure of the German police after the attacks, and Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors in Mellna.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the fires in Zolingen, but participating in the memorial ceremony in Kelne, his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel-Kinkel, in his speech, counted the taxes paid by the Turks in Germany,
It's as if he's setting the value of a person's taxes that he pays.
The current lighting in Turkish media has again shown how the mistrust of many German Turks to the present German State has deepened since then.
It was clear that efforts should now be made to identify and reassess the right-wing terrorist organizations in Germany.
Banquoise scandal in Lake Zurich
Most European banks are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has hardly been aggravated during the financial crisis, and since then it has been constantly fighting with one another and with the other.
Now he must be returned to the right course by a German.
Alex Weber probably didn't suspect that he was going to play this role.
In July, following his effective withdrawal from the position of the head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 he would begin work as the least effective Chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank UBS; unexpected and profitable careers.
Alex Weber was clearly in a hurry, praised Switzerland for her beauty, UBS for her renewed strength, and made several friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
"UBS has been able to change for the better."
"I look forward to working with Caspar Fillier and Oswald Grubel."
But in September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
Treader UBS in London took over the bank's security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
The executive director of UBS Oswald Grubel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of the UBS Board of Directors has been considered ill, and everyone wants to know, when will Alex Weber finally take his position?
Weber has to consult the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank said Tuesday, he will be chaired by the Council in May, not in 2013.
It's not gonna be easy for Alex Weber.
He is a professor of economics and a specialist in the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and he will undoubtedly need time to adapt.
He was secondly responsible for the Bank's strategy, which proved that he had long deserved the name "the biggest bank scandal in Europe".
UBS, on the one hand, is very large - up to a very recent time - has managed the world's largest assets and, on the other hand, has not come out of scandals.
It seems that the proud Swiss bank is not saving anything.
It all started during the financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS had a wonderful reputation.
The Bank combined the image of a hidden and sustainable but at the same time a hunter-in-chief with ambitious goals and the desire to become the biggest player in investment banking.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed 1.6 billion, with more money in the management of residential customers than any other bank in the world,
and entered the League of the largest banks of the world as an investment bank.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and a professor of banking, who has long taught at the University of Zurich Banking Institute, explains: "I have always brought my UBS students as a model of a good bank."
"Know what we know now, you can ask how I could be so wrong."
He really made a big mistake.
Only in 2007 did it become clear that there was something wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, Executive Director Peter Wuffley, who was considered a prominent intellectual and, to the same extent, a shining banker, suddenly left his post.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The Bank ' s investment unit tried to play on substandard securities and had to write billions.
You want to believe you don't, but UBS reported an increase of 13 billion Swiss francs in order to withstand the crisis.
The Bank was indeed able to find investors -- but investors, whose services many bankers had recently refused -- one very clear Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund, so secret that even its name had not been reported.
It was just the first shot.
In April 2008, things got much worse.
The Bank had to declare new billions of losses, and the chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, the second-paying chairman of the Board of Directors in Switzerland, retired in 2006.
A disaster occurred in October 2008 because of the lack of investment in the financial crisis of UBS, and the State had to save it.
The National Bank has purchased UBS toxic papers for an unnamed number of billions, and the Swiss Confederation has paid six billion Swiss francs for convertible bonds with a binding conversion to become the successor of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked: the country was aware of the dramatic consequences of the massive banks in the small country.
Finally, the UBS balance sheet in 2007 was five times more than all of Switzerland's production (see schedule).
"We can't save UBS for the second time," says bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS capitalized in a tax dispute with the United States and stated that it was ready to transfer data from state clients who may have been taxed by the bank.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of reimbursement of unwarranted business income plus fine.
UBS thus acknowledged more or less that it was a tax-reduction tool.
At the same time, UBS lost what was always his advantage in fighting for rich customers, a veil of secrecy.
After that, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors subsequently resigned, and
The client's cash flow started.
In a few months, the bank lost confidence in both main areas of its activity, in investing due to miscalculations and in asset management as a result of assistance and tax avoidance.
And everything just calmed down and it seemed that UBS was able to break down the situation, as this affair with an affronter, and the only trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before they noticed something was wrong in the bank.
Clearly, risk management in the investment office is not yet working.
"Adobolian incident clearly showed that risk control has not changed enough," says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks also has no doubt: “The UBS problem is that he does not have a risk control tool”.
It was the caution of the Swiss bankers for a long time that kept the world's largest assets -- not too risky, but safe for money, whether or not the world was broken off outside the Alpine Republic.
The Swiss bank's safes have become a symbol of unbreakable reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize the fine taste of chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich is still in line with the image of a worthy Swiss private bank, only a little more.
Her location is just a classic.
The main office of the bank is located in Zurich on Bankhofstrass, which leads from the main station directly to the Zurich Lake, in the area of snowcapped Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious and the rental rates for shops are one of the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss shops like Confiserie Sprüngli can be found here, such as Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been present for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the Court of Kreddy Swiss and elite private banks, such as Julius Beer.
The heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
Along the wall of marble, large leather stands, and a number of the bank's emblem is a large "safe" sign.
UBS knows what his clients need, security.
But both the largest banks in Switzerland, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point, have rejected the Swiss idea of the bank deal - or, as the head of one of the small Swiss banks may say, they have been handed over.
He would not like to see his name in the newspaper - like all the Swiss bankers, he also cooperates with the two largest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too large - in particular in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons are very active.
He thinks the Swiss have something to add here.
"And if there's anything that means they've adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs a long time ago."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed UBS and brought him the first major profits - and then the fiasco, and no other European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
"In the midst of this small coalition of people of seven million people, the largest rescue operation in the history of the country," writes Lucas Hassig in his book UBS.
Politicians approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If the Swiss banks ask, they will say that the problem is mainly UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks joined a large group in June 1998.
A bank was established, which was already too big for small Switzerland at the time of the merger, and a bank that continued to grow.
This also helped to complement the two UBS-educated banks; one was a rich but progressive bank specialized in asset management in Zurich; the other was not such a rich but much more internationalized.
International investment banks suddenly got access to a large amount of money that they could use to turn the wheel around.
Two names relate to the growth of UBS: Peter Wolfley, Executive Director of the UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wolfley and Ospel were a team of dreams," says bank analyst Hans Geiger.
"Wulfley, an intelligent, modest and deep-seated model and statistics, and Ospel with his internal instinct, which went all the way up, starting with an intern in the bank."
But Ospel finally settled on Wolfley.
And Wolfley could have made a critical mistake. "He decided his models were a reality," said Geiger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride is ahead of defeat.
UBS officials well remember the meetings of members of the government, at which Wolfley always repeated the same slogan - to admire Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he headed the tournament table, where the success of the banks was achieved.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He could have done part of this way.
UBS was the largest player in the trade of currency and public securities.
The management consultants, however, indicated a weak position, and according to the parameter, which in the banking terminology is called "permanent income", UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had failed in American mortgage products.
To shut the door, UBS entered an adventure that hardly cost him his life.
In an effort to grow, the bank itself and its hedge fund invested in American substandard securities.
This was developed in a large mechanism that combined and sold securities based on US mortgages and continued to carry risks.
Even when other banks have long sought a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
"UBS bought up until summer 2007, when the American real estate market was already in fire," said bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the rise, the deeper the fall.
One manager had to go after the other as attempts to bring the bank in order were more difficult than it seemed at first.
Posts to UBS have become a child game with chairs and remain hopeful to the present day.
In front of anyone who will lead this huge bank, a task is almost impossible.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has returned back to all existing business models.
Gaeger's banking analysis already has the idea of turning down investment banking, focusing on asset management and forgetting its Swiss roots.
Bank, however, is not ready to go that far.
However, it is clear that investment needs to be substantially exploited.
The new bank leader, Sergio Hermotti, plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Swiss banker actually considered only a temporary solution when the bank suddenly separated with its predecessor Grubel.
He has been able to show the character in the past, and now, as the Zurich Bank said on Tuesday, he is head of the UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotty plans to return the investment bank to its condition in the mid-1990s.
It reduces 3,500 jobs.
But that's not enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What's UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
These questions must have been asked by Axel Weber.
He publicly said only that they and his wife are looking for a apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fears of recession in Europe hold down the US stock exchange
The rising recession in Europe has deteriorated the mood of American investors in the beginning of the week.
The change of governments in Athens and Rome had little effect.
The decline in industrial production on the continent has clouded the hope that the debt crisis can be overcome in return.
The general relief resulting from the change of Governments in Rome and Athens has not been supported.
The euro has fallen against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek bottle was still half-full, not half-empty, but now the problems are back in the first place, said Mark Luskini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Financial exchanges, in particular, were in sales lists.
The industrial index of Dow Jones was closed at 12,078 with a fall of 0.6 per cent.
Market barometer in trade ranges between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
A larger S&P 500 index was closed at 1251 points, falling by one per cent.
Nasdaq's technological index lost 0.8 per cent, trading at 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax fell by 1.2 per cent, closing at 5985 points.
Industry in 17 countries has significantly reduced production in the euro area and adjusted to the end of growth.
Eurostat's statistical service reported that in September companies accounted for 2 per cent less than in the previous month.
It's a message from American investors in the skyscrapers, "We're not on the island, we're dependent on them," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also stated that Europe would hardly be able to escape recession and that banks would demonstrate further signs of weakness.
The legendary investor Warren Buffett could only confirm these fears, and in the interview with CNBC, he said that it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do what it takes to end the crisis.
He therefore believed that it was too early to invest in European public bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett has issued a ten-year-long principle into the garbage box and invested in the American high-tech industry.
His investment in IBM amounted to over ten billion dollars in the trade price of the shares of this older company, almost one per cent against the trend.
The shares were closed, almost unchanged, at $187.35.
Buffett stated that he had paid an average of $170 for the share and now had a share of 5.5 per cent.

The Decay Gates Fill the City
The players are considered to be troublebirds in many places, and today experts say that these very smart birds will no longer be able to escape from the cities.
Some love birds, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible, and the ruins of centuries have been part of the urban landscape, but people who complain about thunder and noise are growing in many human settlements.
The problem of birds, however, has not yet been solved.
At the first symposium on crows, experts in Lear, East Frisian, claimed that the player could no longer be expelled from the cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Conservatives claimed that the root of the problem in cities was migration of specially protected toys, indicating that the use of chemicals in agriculture has increasingly destroyed traditional habitats.
The growing construction and cutting of traditional trees made life difficult for birds.
The gates are protected.
There are large colonies of more than 600 parents in the city of Zest in Westfalia and in the north-west of Ivere, Dipholce, Ahima under Bremen and Lere.
The unparalleled project of shooting the crows in Lere caused unfavourable newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics described the hunting of birds in hunting and the killing of them by bats as special cruelty.
"There's nothing to do with the physical movement and dissipation," said the architect and landscape designer Werner Clever of Lear.
The mixing of water currents or a bunch of trees often have undesirable effects, said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lara, Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals are scattered, and large colonies are divided and extended into other areas."
Dissemination may be possible only in the form of an exception to hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
"We have to live with them, and to get rid of them is no choice."
There will be no problem in urban areas, says Mayor Lera Wolfgang Kelner.
A combination of the fear of birds from sheltered areas and their incentive to return to other areas could become an exit.
“Information stands instead of benzopils” was a slogan proposed by psychologist and ethnologist Uto Maria Jurgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. “We must be confident to live with this problem.”
Jørgens was one of the founders of the educational enemy route in Asherberg, Schleswig-Golstein, where information stands on the lives of very clever players.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Jürgens also expressed his opinion on the complaints made by birds, "The noise is transmitting a lot of information, and they need to tell each other a lot."
The wisdom and the charm of these birds have entered the legends, and the players often use not only the tools but also the tools themselves.
Researchers at Cambridge University recently protested the measure of a bird’s mind on four toys.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that they needed to hit the raindrop to get a mole of prayer.
Without special training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to beat the rain.
In another experiment, matching players had to face a more complex challenge.
The researchers put a small welder with a pencil in a vertical cylinder.
Birds couldn't get the profit of a clown.
But the researchers gave them a lot of provocatives.
All four birds took advantage of the propellant to make blood clots and use blood clots to seal the liver by hand and to remove it from the cylinder.
Three of the four players have been able to do this since the first attempt.
Ronaldo concludes Portugal on Euro-2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for victory in the last minute have not been maintained for a long time.

Following the end of the 2004 European Vice-Champion, the account was closed with four more rounds.
Peter Iraček had all the remaining doubts about the 81th minute check.
The 1976 European Championships were sent to the European Championship on the fifth consecutive.
He also smiled at the team of coach Michael Bilek and legions of the Bundesligi Mikhael Kadlez (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Peckhart (1st FC Nuremberg) after a mistake at the very beginning that could become catastrophic.
Peter Chech's Gate at 9 a.m., thanks to the instant reflection, prevented the potential autogol of Thomas Sivok.
The best chance in Montenegro was when the duet of Stefan Jovetic and Dejan Damyanovic were on the field.
Damyanovic was hit at the end of the crime scene at the 40th minute, and he just didn't hit Cheho's goal.
After the break, she saved a world-class Chekh's already hitchhiker after FK Seoul left the field at 50 minutes.
The winner's goal was killed just before the final whistle.
At the time, Turkey did not enjoy football happiness in Zagreb.

While there is no doubt that coach Gus Hiddink will now release the team on the rocking platform until the third place in 2002, the Croatians are being held for the fourth time in the final tour of the European Championship.
Turks have been able to start almost perfectly in the eyes of 31,000 spectators at the Maximir Stadium.
Seljuka Inana's long strike was stopped at the seventh minute, and the attacker Kazim was unable to turn his sword off in the net.
Croatia then woke up and took control of the game more and more.
After the break, the Croats continued the game in excellent shape.
Legionaries of the Bundesligi Daniel Pranich (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Aintracht, Frankfurt) were on the field with Mario Mandjukicz from Wolfsburg, who took place Ivana Perishic from Dortmund at 62 minutes.
Trapattoni is going to Euro-2012.
The Irish people in Dublin celebrated their first Euro trip after Germany in 1988.
Coach John Trapattoni's team, who had already appeared confident in its place after winning 4:0 in the first phase, took the leadership for the 32nd minute thanks to Stephen Ward's goal.
Konstantin Vasilev from the guest team compared the account at 57 minutes.
Ireland took a good pace from the beginning, but only at the 23rd minute Robbie Kein from Los Angeles had the first clean head shot.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender could not have allowed him to take Ireland forward.
The goal was killed in 32 minutes.

SAP plans to double the number of workers in China
The largest software manufacturer in Europe, SAP, plans to invest billions and almost double the number of employees in China in the next few years.

Mass killings - human dimension
An exciting and very good new book by Peter Engunda, "The Beauty and Grief: The Personal History of the First World War", begins with a long list of active people whose hearts die.
Here’s the advice as to how to read: Carefully cut this page and use it as a bookmark.
You will get to know these people very close as Mr. Englund's education, and this list of active people will be your GPS, your home when, like one of these men and women, you'll get out of the way and get lost in the fog of war.
Mr. England is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book that he wrote now -- unusual, he describes it, quite precisely, as an anti-history work.
It has few known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, journalists or discussions of tactics and martial arts.
It's not so much a book about what it was, it explains how "the book about what it looked like." It's about " feelings, impressions, emotions and the state of the spirit."
The book "Crazy and Grief" has combined the experiences of more or less undetectable men and women over the 20 years, from both sides of the front line, from school students and botanists to alpineists, doctors, early-help drivers and servants.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone falls into jail, loses his hand or leg, goes out with his mind or dies.
Their lives die here like church candles: new ones are added to many others, and some will be destroyed at that time.
Mr. England's book is a departure from the historical book standard.
This is an amendment to the idea that the First World War was only a serious war in the West Front.
“Crazy and Grief” is an ideal place for other theatres of military action: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
There are bees in this book; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under pyramids; the unresolved problem is flies.
It's an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
War robs these people of their lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, a smokeless vacuum.
When you're a woman and you're at home with your children, you'll stay in the place or you'll be safe?
Anyway, who's going to do this?
Almost no one understands what's going on and why we have to fight this war at all.
"The lack of facts," notes Mr. England, "is filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, compelling ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and hearings."
"Crazy and Grief" follows the fate of such people as Florence Farmboro, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German Navy sailor.
Their stories were taken mainly from memoirs, letters, and other material that had already been published.
The stories about their lives may be frightening or fascinating, but they are, to a large extent, alive because of the small moments and the fragile details gathered by Mr. England.
Many of them are about to be left behind and about how to deal with them.
When he told the story of a German schoolgirl, he said, "Erzaz, there's an iron. "
"Foreign coffee, fake aluminium, non-precious resin, paper binders, wood puddles."
He continued to talk about grass dust in Germany.
It describes “the meat of pressed rice, baked in the barrel of fat (and decorated with fake bone made from wood); tobacco made from dried roots and dried potatoes; footwear, covered with wood”.
He noted that there were "837 registered meat substitutes authorised for the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories point to honor and courage.
One American observes his own passion for cruelty and says about war: "You feel that, at the end of the day, it's what men were created for instead of sitting in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspaper or bestselling and claiming that this show is civilization and under your slender sleeves, there is no barbary."
A British soldier, on the other hand, notices that he is likely to die, and no one notices or grieves.
"When a person is calm about self-sacrifice, he would like to think that this is going to happen before the public," he writes.
But it's, on the other hand, awfully like, "a convicted man who's hung up in secret."
Other comments concern an old Europe that is being demolished and new forms of fear.
"The conflict has become increasingly economic competition," writes Mr. England, "a war plant".
He notes the coming of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the beginning century: a beautifully expressive and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-knit suit, who wears a shirt sitting behind a written table".
People are unforeseeable: low rates of action are as low as heroism.
Mr. Englund told me about the soldiers who were trying to get rid of the prostitutes of a venereal disease in order to avoid serving on the front.
"The only gruesome expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonorrhea, which soldiers bought and mutilated themselves on genitals in the hope of entering a hospital," he writes.
"All the desperate people threw him in the eye, which often led to lifelong blindness."
Translated by Swedish Peter Gravez for Mr. Englund's flexible, but countless, wonderfully suited for his humanitarian task.
In dozens of small scenes, it shows how the war “released completely uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred”.
People start asking why their leaders make them fight.
Better books on the 1st World War were often unfair, such as “Great War and Modern Memory” by Paul Fassela or by such novels as “On the West Front Without Change” by Erica-Marie Remarka, not exaggerating historical works.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this untempered pantheon.
His book has the most amazing final that I can remember in uncanny literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it's like he's on a page with a list of characters, he's got it out of your hands, and he's got it on fire.
After the previous error - carefully calculated
Hundreds of police officers, some in protective helmets, were involved in the operation.
The night hours from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because at Zukotti Park at that time there must have been fewer people.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers, the others said they were going to study.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the centre of the events, and his presence emphasized the importance of the operations of the Department of Police.
There could be no repetition of such episodes in the last few weeks as the use of gas against protestors, which was contrary to the Department ' s rules, and caused a storm of sympathy for the public to the occupying parties.
Thus, after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation to free the protesting Zukotti Park began.
The authorities were preparing to observe the expansion of occupations in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis studies were conducted on Randels Island, calculated on Zukotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called trainings in the event of riots - counter-terrorism measures that involve the rapid movement of a large number of police officers - in the sense of Lower Manhattan.
The last training took place on Monday evening on the east-river Manhattan side.
The order to enter the park came in the last minute, and told the source of the orders in which the order was referred only to as "training".
"The several diggers I know and called on this case didn't say they were sent to the Zukotti Park," said the man who spoke on the terms of anonymity.
"The only ones who knew they were going to Zukotti Park were at the highest positions in the department."
One of the reasons for the secret was a lesson that took place in the city.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clean up the park, but they withdrew from hundreds of protestors who had slipped within the deadline, hearing about these plans.
On Tuesday, police officers from various police units, including the district forces, were involved in the operation, which were usually used to control criminal districts.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like work, came and left the park during the day, making one hour of the night a suitable time for arrival.
"It was right to do this when there was the least of the people in the park," he said.
The search engines and loudspeakers were assembled at Pike-Slip and Franklin Roosevelt-Drive, around the Manhattan Bridge before moving forward.
The prospector and the pre-written announcements made by thunderstorms seem to have frightened many protestors.
When the officers of the administrative units entered the park in their blue winds, many protestors simply picked up their things and left.
The police reported that the camps had not touched up to 1:45 a.m., giving the protest time to collect things.
Other police groups, according to the testimony of the witnesses, gathered on the perimeter to enter if the park needed arrests.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, head of the Department of Police, said that this had been done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they have not been allowed to see how the police are doing, and that the police have treated them cruelly.
Mr. Brown said that cameras on Church Street, along the west border of the park, could take a picture.
When the police went west through the chest of personal protests, including bags, plastic bags and polyethylene bags, full of clothes, the Department's teams followed her by collecting what had been thrown away.
Some of the protestors who refused to leave, took the photos outside, soon appeared on the Internet.
The main protest group took positions near the kitchen camp at the park center.
Some built barricades, and the police went inside, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the camp's epicenter dug their hands together.
And two people came to the trees, Mr. Kelly said.
In order to cut the locks, rescue officers were called up.
There were no arrests in the park until 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The cleaning operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police reported.
Mr. Brown said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of them were arrested for “infringement of public order and resistance in detention”, he said.
Joseph J. Esposito, Head of Department and Senior Officer of the Department, was the highest-ranking officer in the field.
Phil. T. Pulaski, head of the Department's D.A., was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, although he was present, "did not manage the operation," said Mr. Brown.
The second group of police were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Sidar Street, if necessary.
The fences were located in Cortland Street, in the district north of the park, and in Pine Street, in the district south.
Observers saw the police expand their perimeter even further beyond the Zukotti Park.
At one point, observers saw a group of policemen, many with shields, pushing people further.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events occurred south of the park.
About 5 a.m. to the south of Pine Street, one of the protestors jumped onto the roof of the police car, while others said that they had fired air from the rails of the police station.
At some point, the crowd flew a piece of the flag.
As a result, one police officer and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
The trade union of staff serving schools will enter the city in court for dismissal
The trade union, representing hundreds of school staff who lost their seats last month, plans to bring them to court in the city on Wednesday, claiming that dismissals were not necessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor students are taught.
The trial is probably the last means available to the trade union of the District Council 37 seeking to abolish dismissal.
Sixty-two school assistants, coordinator of work with parents and other employees, who were among the lowest-paid workers in the city, lost their seats on 7 October as a result of the union leaders calling for a political response to their refusal to give the city access to medical funds managed by working groups to close the gap in the budget last spring.
City officials have categorically rejected this charge.
At the City Council hearings last month, the school Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said that discharges were part of the budget they signed in June.
One of the board members spoke to him, saying that there was no indication in the budget that school support staff would be fired.
The representatives of the 37 District Council reported that they had made a notification of claims, warning the Department of Education that a complaint had been filed against it; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to announce a formal request to the Supreme Court of State in Manhattan.
Mr. Walcott and the Department of Urban Education will be referred to as respondents and eight temporary workers are listed as claimants, all black or Latin American women, as well as most of the assistants who have lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the legal department of the city, said that the city had not seen a request and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions.
According to the preliminary version of the complaint under New York Times, the trade union focused on a number of dismissals in schools in poor urban areas to support the claim of unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools had lost more assistants because they were chronically underfunded.
He points out that while there was no dismissal in the Staten Island and there were few in the schools of Upper East Side or Tribeki, 17 school supporters lost their seats in approximately 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to go to Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants working in free secondary school 36 in Garlem, where 68 per cent of students live in poverty, the claim is: “These are not areas of state-owned parents who can find money to fill budget gaps”.
P.S. Budget 36 was cut by 3.26 per cent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed its way of counting additional funding for each poor student who went to school.
The trade union also claims that the school director could be misled by the language of the notification allowing the dismissal of coordinators from working with parents.
The notification used the word “exceeding” although “exceeding” is more often used when a teacher from the school's payroll is moved to a list of existing employees who are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six coordinators for working with parents were fired," says the blackout, "and not just translated."
Mission completed, Congress ready for agreement on Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats at the Capital Hill are finally ready to agree on something relevant to the rise in Libya.
All it took was for the fight to succeed, the former dictator Muamar Qaddafi was arrested and killed, and American intervention ended.
On Tuesday, the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Senate should consider a resolution issued by President John Kerry (democratic, Massachusetts) along with Senators John McKain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Liberman (independent, Connecticut), who praised the Libyans for their successful resurrection and the American troops for their "revenge".
"The meaning of this resolution is to pay tribute to the brave people of Libya when they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"This is the confirmation of support for their democratic aspirations by both parties."
The language may be harmless, but no further discussion on Libya was easy.
This summer, legislators from both parties argued with each other and the White House on the formulation of a series of resolutions approving or condemning the role of the US Army in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McKain introduced a resolution allowing the limited use of the US armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority of the two parties and did not vote in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the House also did not support the proposal to cut the financing of the US operation in Libya.
This left an American mission in some kind of legislative purgatory - when Congress is angry enough to criticise Obama's approach to the mission, but not so bad as to actually kick the ground out of her feet.
Then, events fueled the insolventness of the Congress
In August Tripoli surrendered to the Libyan rebels, and Caddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission was officially completed on 31 October.
Now the Senate can be ready for action.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs “is admired by the people of Libya for its extraordinary courage and unconventional persistence in the pursuit of freedom” and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also “confirms the national interest of the United States in the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya”.
Will new measures be fully supported by the Council on Foreign Affairs or will legislators, like the June Bill?
Senator Richard G. Luger, leader of the Republic of the Committee, opposed the latest version.
The representative of Luger said on Monday that he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other hand, the Chamber ' s Capital should vote this week for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, the main legislative priority for almost every Republican and for some Democrats in Congress.
This measure proposed by a member of the House of Representatives of Bob Goodlate (Republican, Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other which will be put to the plenary vote of the Congress of this convening.
Other legislators had not yet been able to make their amendments to the plenary meeting, but not because they had not tried.
The amendment of Goodlat is only one of 68 constitutional amendments affecting a wide range of issues that have been raised.
Some were duplicated - the same bill was passed in the House of Representatives and in the Senate - and others were minor variations.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendments only in the House of Representatives and a few more on “control over federal expenditure”.
Some of them are also identical, but they give their authors, mainly the newly elected Republicans who want to decorate their abstracts, the opportunity to boast that they have "extended" such a proposal.
The Budget Control Act, which passed in August, required the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote in favour of an amendment to the balanced budget.
In March 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen want to limit the number of terms of office of members of the Congress, while a member of the House of Representatives José Serrano (democratic, New York) wants to cancel the two terms of office for the President.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson-younger (Democrat, Illinois) proposed a number of amendments that guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and health.
The amendment banning single-sex marriages has been proposed for many years, as well as another banning the burning of the flag.
Some legislators would also like to allow the abolition of federal laws if two thirds of the States objected to them.
No matter how members of the Congress tried to propose amendments, they were moving no faster than in the past years.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 such amendments, and at 110th, they introduced 66.
This rate is measured compared to the beginning of the 1990s when Congress members, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But their success was no more than it is now.
The last amendment, which was adopted, was approved in 1992, but was actually introduced to Congress in 1789.
"The beat, but not sure," said Giffords in his first television interview after the attempt.
Ten months after an armed man shot at her at a public event in Tuson, a member of the House of Representatives Gabriel Giffords (Democratic Party, Arizona) appeared on the federal channel on Monday evening, she sang a song from the "Solence Return Tomorrow" boat show and said that she wanted to get better than to go back to Congress.
Having appeared on the 20/20 A-bi-si News programme with Diana Sawyer, Giffords worked hard to formulate proposals and needed assistance in walking.
The program showed her a difficult way of recovering from the trauma of the lung, which broke the skull and broke the left side of the brain from the front to the back of her head.
Three months later, she unexpectedly returned to the House of Representatives and voted triumphantly on the draft limit-debt law.
In his first television interview after the January shooting, which killed six and injured 13 people, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang, and called his healing “hard”.
Soyer's 41-year-old Giffords said, "That's good."
An interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the 20/20 special edition, which was shown before the release of the wife's new book "The History of Courage and Hope".
The special investigation related the restoration of Giffords after the shooting on 8 January.
On a video taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she's lying on a hospital bed with a head up and a long scarf on her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers at the request of her husband.
A few months later, we saw Giffords sitting in the wheelchair, and the physiotherapists were teaching her how to do simple things.
Squeeze your head.
Pull your lips out.
And then her first word, "What."
A few days later, Giffords spoke the second word, "tooth", asking for a change in the menu tomorrow.
The video shown by E-bi-si shows that music played a central role in the healing of Giffords: we see a congressman singing with the doctors "The Girls Just Want to Have Fun" Cindy Loper and "Free Fall" Tom Petty.
In an interview with Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, she said she would not remember the day of temptation.
Her husband told her that he was reading the Giffords article in the March 12 shooting newspaper, when she stopped it for the first time to ask about the six who were killed at the time.
Suspected attacker Jared Li Lafner is in Missouri prison and is being subjected to forced treatment pending trial.
"Many people died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Burst, heavy, heavy."
Once when she was healed, Kelly Sawyer said, "I'm sure."
"And I said, "Bebby, you're not sure," said Kelly.
You're just beat.
And you're going through it, you're going to get better and you're going back stronger than ever.
Soldiers feel more grief than respect
The event was a festival at Wall Street, which gathered millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock had a ballad about helplessness, disappointments and losses.
Several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots, and sailors marched around him.
The tuxedo audience applauded him standing there.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Zaltzman, who organized the spring collection of money.
The senior military officer at the concert, which was also chaired by the Committee of Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mallen, saw the role of troops in the other.
"They were treated like orphans," wrote the officer in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect, it was pity.
The very opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relations that have been established between the army and often an even-hearted, sometimes admired American audience.
Soldiers deserve praise for their victims.
But the praisers have their price, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting as if it was a pity for people in the form of others.
"We are not victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and was soon leaving for Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way for some to show support is to treat us as unhappy."
This is a sensitive theme for military leaders who do not want to look ungrateful or disagree with the society they serve.
They also understand that the anger of the returning armies in recent years of war in Viet Nam was much worse.
As a result, the majority of the discussions on grief take place quietly and only among the war veterans.
After his two sons had returned from military action in the navy, Colonel Mark Kenshn warned them that people would not be seen in the army from two perspectives.
Some will look at them with admiration, for they were hugging the rebels and staying in exotic places.
Others will wonder if "the masked evil veteran is hiding," said Kenshn, who fought in Iraq and, returning, took a high government position in Washington.
While he was looking for work, he said he felt that some interviewers had been cautious about whether he could withstand the tension of responsible work in Washington immediately after the war.
Kenshn remembers saying to his sons, "When you tell about your service, you have to expect a negative effect."
The turmoil experienced by the military is partly caused by American indifference to wars.
The victory in the field is rarely praised by a country that is not familiar with the army and sees little direct benefits from the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism as usual in the Second World War," said Lieutenant General David Bernow, who led US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public is mainly focused on the depth of the suffering of the military.
The troops estimate the number of returns they have made, the number of friends they have lost, or the level of losses they have lost.
The army faces increasing pressure from supporters to fight rape
This week, at the historical court hearings, it should be decided whether 28 men and women will be charged with rape charges against the army.
If not, hundreds of claimants will be in line with the following.
Elizabeth Lyman, 25 years of age and 11 weeks of pregnancy, was reportedly raped by her partner at night.
It was in October 2008, she returned to her barracks at Miramar airport, north of San Diego after dinner with another, and met a male attendant carrying a pack of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could go to her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag," says Lyman.
But Tessa's breeding has lifted her fears.
I thought, "No, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I'm sorry I didn't listen to my instincts then."
A few minutes after they entered the Lyman room, the man came behind her, fell down and raped, she claimed.
This week, 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former soldiers will be eager to wait for the court's ruling in the historic hearing that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and decide whether they will go to the court of appeal that they have brought against former Minister of Defence Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rasmfeld.
The claim claims that Gates and Ramsfeld were unable to cope with widespread violence in the army in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The claim made in February by counsel Susan Berk of Washington, D.C. originally included 17 claimants, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all claiming that they had been raped or threatened by employees and that the army had not properly investigated, prosecuted or rendered appropriate justice after the alleged attacks.
Berk says she's focused on the top of the army because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people who can destroy the cult of violence?
Berk also said that she had been contacted by some 400 other victims in February, many of whom could participate in future demands.
Its strategy: instead of collecting all the claimants in this case -- putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak -- it will open up a lot of cases, if necessary, to support the pressure.
The defence team of the Ministry of Defence under the leadership of Federal Prosecutor Neil McBrayda has taken steps to stop the case.
The judicial documents received by Newsweek reveal a strategy of protection - mainly the fact that ex- or current soldiers cannot report claims by the army for damage suffered by the armed forces.
According to the doctrine of the Supreme Court of 1950, the Federal Government is not responsible for the damage caused by military personnel.
"The alleged damage relates to the risk posed by the military service of the claimants," the documents say.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially forbidden to participate in the war, this division exists only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear frontline.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the war zone.
As a result, 150 women soldiers were killed between the two wars, two thirds of them in the war.
It is also time for the armies to become modern, says Berk.
She is not alone in her fight; in addition to her request, three others are ready.
In the Yeel legal school, the Veterans Legal Service Seminar prepares a case against the four largest military academys in charge of the promotion of the female hate atmosphere.
The separate non-commercial association of American veterans of war in Viet Nam is preparing a complaint against an army, in which the diagnosis of “change of personality” that is the victim of violence to eliminate them is a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Anna Bhagwati from the human rights group of the Organization of Action of Women soldiers.
Her group filed a complaint against the Veterans Office in December, accusing her of discriminatory treatment of people who claimed that sexual violence had been threatened during the service.
Nine separate bills proposing a number of measures were introduced to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, 3,158 rape attempts were reported by the Department of Prevention and Combating Sexual Violence.
However, it is known that attacks are often not reported, and according to the Pentagon ' s own estimates, this figure is approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
This report, published in March, also examines the percentage of court cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of known cases came before the court - twice as much as in the civil justice system.
In the Berk case, they are called attacks only the first in a number of other traumas.
In the case of Lyman, she reported rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she said, she was asked to report details of rape to the police, doctors, and commanders 11 times.
She collected a set of evidence of rape, and the blood of the attacker, from the cut in his hand, was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was sitting in front of a judge during which she was asked if she had had sex with her friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six people gave a positive description to the accused, who was finally justified.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I was a rose now - I escaped from the courtroom with a scream."
"They put me in a psychiatric ward, and when I left, I remember my commander saying, "It wasn't a court over him, it was a court against me."
Lyman was ordered to contact a military psychiatrist who finally diagnosed her with a change in personality, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was released with an unfavourable wording, which did not allow her to receive any benefits.
If the case is brought forward by Lyman and her colleagues on appeal, it is a difficult question, says John Terley, professor of law at the University of Washington Law School.
But he says, "I think they're in a position to move forward."
The doctrine that has been criticised since it came into existence stands between them and the verdict.
I've been criticizing Dr. Ferrez for my whole life.
The army has remained for decades because it does not have the incentives and restraints that impose responsibility.
He adds, "A lot of odds against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when ordinary people want to fight.
If the hearing is not for their benefit, Berk, the complainant's lawyer, will collect hundreds of other claimants for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until reform is achieved," she said.
Or until we die, depending on what happens earlier.
The wall has eyes: How the researchers are studying you in Facebook
Before becoming a new face of legal extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Bravik was an ordinary man who expressed his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Bravik, who was aware of the mass murder in Norway in July, who had killed 77 people, attended his first open trial.
Although Bravik could act alone, he was not alone in the network: he spent a lot of time preparing for an attack on his computer, along with millions of nationalists who supported the right groups in social networks.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to learn more about these people.
But how do you find them?
It's easy to go to Facebook.
"We understood that it was not difficult to improve," says Jamie Bartlett, the author of the recently published report on European Cyber-Populism of the British Research Centre DEMOS.
The storage of personal data in Facebook is so great, Bartlett says, that researchers could easily use an advertising tool on the site to assign the necessary demographic group with scientific accuracy - that marketing scientists have been doing it for several years.
The Bartletta team found half a million right-wing fans throughout Europe and then promoted them to advertising, but instead of showing a new group or diet product, the ad offered to the user an inquiry into the level of their education, violence and optimism about their own future.
With the help of Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues, more than 10,000 participants were able to consult 14 parties in 11 European countries, even without leaving the office.
"This is a completely new way to conduct research," Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not so striking: online parties to the right groups are the most young men in the sex, inadequate immigration.
But suddenly, "those who combine their online activity with offline activity are smarter, more democratic and less aggressive than those who just walk behind the monitor."
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and politikologists use a site to study the world's health issues to social trends, which are expressed in Lakes, wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, adding an average of three records per day, the “super-current information” Facebook has generated a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles called the website by 800 per cent over the past five years.
For some researchers, Facebook is a prelude to the fact that it provides an opportunity to explore people to whom it is impossible to go on a road with a locker.
"Before, if you wanted to interrogate people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You would have to join the party, and they would never have accepted you," Bartlett said.
"The Facebook shuts down all of this -- you're going straight to them."
Others say that the site could identify and investigate social health issues.
The latest study by Dr. Megan Moreno at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues showed that students who discussed their drinking habits in Facebook were far more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about it.
Moreno assumes that students' peers, such as their community teachers, could monitor the site and interfere to help a student who is too often updating drunk status.
"You can't solve the problem without finding it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author Moreno and Director of the Centre for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research and Research Institute of Seattle.
"We have found a way to identify children from a risk group that would otherwise not have been identified."
Facebook also constantly collects data about its users.
The Data Management Group processed the statistics on the relationship and day of St. Valentine's Day, the appearance of voters in the mid-2010 period, and the National Happiness Index (mostly using the information available to them, the cyber-freedom champions have long insisted that the site should make its extensive collection of data publicly available for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching, likes it or does not - in exchange for the possibility of playing in Scribble with another in thousands of miles of you, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become participants in a study they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict standards for online research, online data is generally available.
"I don't think that many users would have thought that the researcher could observe their profiles," says Neil Selvin, a sociologist from the London Knowledge Laboratory, about the study he conducted in 2006 using the public access pages of students in Facebook.
"The way they imagined it, it was just between them and their friends."
Then there is a question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that the subject of the study is extremely honest.
It is not possible to find out how much information in the profile and on the user's page is true.
"What you're saying in Facebook and what you're doing outside Facebook is two absolutely different things," says Selvin.
That is why, despite the years of his work in the field of technological research, Selvin thinks that the notebook and the handle are still the best research tools of those that can be used.
"Nothing can replace the entry into real peace and communication with real people," he said.
Social research is supposed to be about social, and most of the social is still going offline.
"Frozen and Inhuman": Anders Bering Bravik will be brought before the court for the first time
Anders Bering Bravik, a man who was aware of the double attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a fighter of "responsibility" during the first public appearance in Oslo.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Riczar of the Tampliers of Norway," he said before 500 in the courtroom.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the actions, but I don't admit the guilt."
Judge Torkyel Nesheim interrupted Bravik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Bravik an opportunity to use this hearing as a venue for expressing his own views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Brawik, who had brought his earlier written statement, to contact the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Bravik in custody for another 12 weeks, prohibited him from having access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some were hoping to see Bravik in the eye, others were convinced that he was under the lock.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," told the Norwegian NRK channel one of the survivors of the Uttoya.
"It was uncomfortable, but I got a little easier myself after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Bravik remained calm and professionalism throughout the entire hearing and looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors when he came in and out of the building.
Despite Bravik's strange idea that he was part of a major resistance movement, the judge decided that he was not mistaken, and said that there was no evidence that he was working with the partners.
Some may be relieved by the fact that the attacks of 22 July appear to be the work of one extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically reduce the sorrow and confusion that the whole nation now feels.
"I'd like him to look like a monster, but it's not like that," said one victim's relative.
"It'd be a lot easier if it were."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview showing in the theater this week
After Steve Jobs died on 5 October, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing technical genius as the Great Designer of Modernity.
But the fact that Apple fans can count as the biggest opening in a recent interview, which they recalled in advance of the preliminary demonstrations in the main markets this week, is how much this creative mind was involved in business processes and production technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer and a hippie, but he was also a sufficient organizer and a modernist of the production process, who believed that many business leaders were suffering from “the disease to think that a really big idea was 90 per cent of the work... [but] a great idea from a large product separates a huge amount of experienced work”.
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley created the Triumph Nerve Teleserial on the appearance of a personal computer, and he spent more time with Jobs for a unique long conversation.
By then, it had been about 10 years since Jobs had been expelled from Apple, and he was already working in his new NeXT computer company in anticipation of the Internet.
As a small part of the Kringley interview was used in Nerdah, he said that the original interview was missing during transport.
Only after Job's death, a full VHS copy was found in the director's garage.
This film, slightly edited, became the basis for the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: A Lost Interview that dates to Landmark Theatres on Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man known for his hatred for detailed interviews, Jobs here seems to be unusually prepared to present his technological philosophy and business strategy.
And incredibly thoughtful.
At four different moments during the interview, there are large intervals between questions and answers - thinking in 10-15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to say more.
There are also moments when perfectionism of Jobs goes to the surface, where he seems to be concerned with the issues of Kringley, which make him more concerned with matters or issues of greater importance.
In the retreat to the era of Picsar, Ipods and iPhones, there is something more vicious than a prophetic interview, when Jobs assesses what he sees that various companies are doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of future information technologies.
One thing is to read about Job's postmortem evaluations, but there's something early and inspiring in Job's, which we see here, an alarming dreamer at the threshold of magnitude.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A brief summary of seven significant findings of the Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"All the time in the business, I kept asking, "Why are you doing this?" And the answers that you get are always saying, "Oh, that's just how it is."
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks of business very deeply.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continued to describe his efforts to streamline reporting in Apple.
It was built in a way of recording costs, often from “standard costs”, which were taken from the bottom and then moved by “cleaning”, and it created an automated structure that guaranteed that they could track business costs even to the mill.
About the joke over the Pope:
Jobs tells details about the blue box, which he bottled with Steve Voznjak, a device that enabled people to effectively break a phone company and call for a long distance free of charge.
The device was written a lot earlier, but Jobs' affair here, describing the blue box as an act of giving authority contagious.
He tells how he and Voznjak tested the box using a phone-automat, ordering a conversation and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until they connected as many stations as possible.
"We've covered the Earth's layer of half-life once, and you've been screaming in a phone machine, and it's been a minute later in a neighbor's phone machine," said Jobs with a smile.
"We were young, and all we took is that we could chew something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We two knew a little bit, but we could chew a little thing that could control a lot of things -- that was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple could ever come along without that.
Jobs continued to describe in detail one famous outcome he and Voznjak had practically managed, calling the Vatican through the blue box at midnight and asking for the Pope's phone, all of them trying to copy Henry Kissinger.
When several members of the Catholic hierarchy were challenged in the middle of the night to talk to an American diplomat, the two were furious just before the Pope himself was picked up to answer the phone.
About the love of technology (and the cold calling of Bill Heulett):
When he was 12 years old, he was hunting for spare parts to collect a frequency meter, and he found Bill Hewlett in his phonebook and called him.
Soon after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a summer sub-contract at Heulette Pacard.
"It had a strong impact on me, it was the only company I saw at the age, and it formed my view that such a company and how well they relate to their staff."
Jobs later became one of the HP personnel who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer".
He was the size of a chemo, he had a little monitor with an electronic tube, and I fell in love with him.
I used to ride in the HP adolescent and spin around that car and write a program for her.
About improvised innovation:
In a number of places, Jobs interviewed about the invention of new products on the flight.
When he went out to sell a piece of furniture, a buyer asked him to collect a whole computer.
Working 30 days in credit, he had to think about both the collection and the delivery of ready-made devices.
Later in Apple, he recalls the difficulties he faced when developing a computer mouse:
"I remember angry arguments... they shouted at me that it would take five years [to collect the mouse that would cost $300], and I was stuck in the throat, and I went out, and I found the designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
About large energy-loss companies:
Long before he led the recovery of Apple, Jobs accurately predicted that many leaders had failed to see the situation and had lost control of their market share.
"Let's say you're working on IBM or Xerox, so you're doing a better copy or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company doesn't get any more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, thus [these types of people] who eventually lead companies, and people making products are forced out of decision-making areas.
The genius of the product, which has led to this monopolistic position, is exacerbated by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products - the required skill.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could take over the entire information technology industry.
It could be ten times more, it could be a Microsoft 90x...
They've been defeated.
About innovation as an art form:
"A great idea from a great product separates a huge amount of experienced work ... when you distort a great idea, it changes and grows."
You'll know a lot about her thinness.
There are compromises that you need to go to - some things you can't force you to do electronics, glass, robots or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in mind -- these concepts, bringing them all together...
In the end, it's all tasteful -- it's all trying to express itself in the best way that people have ever produced -- and then it's trying to get it into what you're doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've always had a hard time finding great ideas.
Part of what was done by famous Macintosh was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who became the best information technology specialists in the world.
If not information technology, they would do amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are lunching with opponents of the Health Act while the court is considering the case.
On the day that the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the political issue, would it listen to the resignation of President Obama's health law, his two judges, Antonina Skalia and Clarence Thomas, honoring the lunch sponsored by the legal firm that would contest the case before the Supreme Court.
This happened last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the petition.
One case on the agenda was an application supported by 26 states contesting the urgent health review adopted by the Congress last year, which brought together conservative activists from all over the nation.
The judges agreed to consider the process; in fact, the reverse debate is expected at 5 1/2 hours in March 2012, and the outcome is likely to be a mix in the presidential race, which will be at the worst by the time the trial is announced.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the health law should be repealed will probably be Paul Clement, who was the deputy Attorney General at the time of President George V. Bush.
The Legal firm Clementa, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped to sponsor the annual lunch of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group that consistently advocates conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored lunch represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, who has a huge financial interest in the light of gravity.
The lunch was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the court meeting on the case.
He attended, among other things, Mitch McConnell, a leader of the Republicans in the Senate, and a well-known opponent of the Health Act.
The first guests for lunch?
Nothing new: two judges have been visiting the Federalist Society for many years.
And that doesn't go against ethical standards at all.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were obedient, they might fall under Principle 4C of the Code, which reads: “The judge may visit the charitable activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge may not be a rapporteur, a guest or a reference in the programme of such activities”.
However, the apparent proximity of Sculia and Thomas to two legal firms in this case, as well as to a company with high financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethics activists in the Government.
"This flagrant violation of ethics and the independence of the code contradicts the statements of some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules as apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the General Court.
"The judges have been drinking and eating at the official action to collect money with lawyers whose cases are now being dealt with in court."
Their appearance and assistance in collecting money for this event undermines all statements of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas hardly draw attention to critics who say they are very willing to mix court cases with groups of the kind of federalist community.
And Thomas' wife, Ginny, is a famous conservative activist.
Furthermore, the conservatives claim that this is an ethical issue for Judge Elena Kagan, not Sculia and Thomas.
Kagan was the main legal service in Obama's administration when the first legal objections to the law were filed at the level of the court of the first instance.
Her critics demanded that Kagan refuse to listen to the case because she was too involved in the protection of the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan didn't show that she was going to do that.
Boeing receives a record 18 billion order for aircraft
The Emirates airline orders 50 broad-fissed lines of Boeing 777 and maybe another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, which is over $1 billion.
It's hardly news that the company gets an order for 50 units of its product.
But this is an important event when this company, Boeing Co., and the pre-currency price for all these 50 aircraft is $18 billion.
It's so important where Boeing got an order: The Middle East, growing gold, lived future orders on airplanes.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced in these exits its largest in the dollar equivalent order for commercial aircraft - 50 Boeing 777 two-pass aircraft.
An incredible order was received from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has the opportunity to buy another 20 aircraft, which will raise the total pre-currency price to $26 billion, Boeing said on Aviashou Dubai 2011.
Later Monday, Boeing reported, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, so-called Dreamliner, which can enjoy a much better fuel economy and passenger convenience.
The surplus price for six aircraft is over $1 billion.
"It's really good for Boeing," said an analyst Morningstar Neil Dior.
"The quality of these specific buyers is quite high."
Many neighbouring eastern airlines own oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, they have not only the money to pay for aircraft, but also the increase in fuel prices, which usually harms airlines, as this is one of the largest items of expenditure, is not so much a loss because the country earns money at high oil prices.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel the order when prices grow, Diora said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The order of Emirates strengthens Boeing's leadership in the market for broadband aircraft and helps to prevent rival Airbus SAS from attempting to reach its masters with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory on the plane took place four months after Airbus stated that he would postpone the biggest A350 debut, which competed with only once from 777-300ER.
He postponed the duty to increase the axle load after the buyers had demanded to increase the load capacity and the length of the flight.
Boeing Co shares grew by 1.5 per cent to $67.94.
Mexican President's sister evidently lost her election in Michoakane
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers helped the opposition Fausto Valeho from the IRP in the pre-election race.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon did not appear to have made her application to the place of Governor Michoakan during the severe public elections, and she said Monday that drug dealers had helped to remove the race for one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, the leader of the Western State Governor's race is called Fausto Valeho from the institutional-revolutionary party, or IRP.
“Intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming not only for Michoakana, but also for the entire country,” said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview the next day after the resurrection.
"They frightened our candidates, our employees in the elections... they caught the polling clocks, they put obstacles... and they made people vote" for the IPR.
IRP managed Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
It prepares for the return, and victory in Michoacane is an important step in this attempt.
IRP hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Valeho, it seems, was just a little smacked by Calderon, who headed the polls until the day of the election.
Calderon, a candidate for the National Action Party, or the PND led by her brother, refused to recognize Valeho as the winner.
Sylvano Aureolas, a left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolutionary Party, or the DRP, which now belongs to the governor's chair, has suffered a third - serious defeat for the separated and unsuccessful left in front of the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Valeho, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denied contact with drug dealers and called on other candidates to recognize the results.
Drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines have long been held in Mitchoacan.
This is the native state of President Calderon, and he selected Michoakan to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence has continued to exist so far.
The mayor of the PND was killed a week before the elections, when he was running for Louis Maria Calderon, and several candidates left the local pre-election race for fear.
For the IPR, however, it would seem terrible to see the elections in Michoakana, but victory will give the party a driving impulse.
The man who was supposed to represent the IPR in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Valeho and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging in the run-up next year."
ABR convinces Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank forced India and China to be prepared to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would stop the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, director of the ABR office in Manila, said that the two fastest-growing economies should “do all they can” to accelerate the recovery of the currency block through either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that BRIC countries were looking at Europe's difficulties “indiscriminately”, and said that Asian financial assistance on the side of European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term decline in the global economy.
"We're all involved."
"That is why anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he reported in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia can be protected to some extent, but she can't be vulnerable."
"So if China and India can help, that must be done."
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, the Italian loan funds have grown threatening, and the prime ministers, both Italy and Greece, have retired.
The emerging debt crisis in Europe gave rise to fears that it could bring the world economy back to recession and brought the leading developing economies together to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr. Neg predicted that any Asian assistance would be provided through IMF, but said bilateral cooperation -- a type of purchase of the EU financial assistance fund, a means of ensuring financial stability in Europe -- would give great force to Asian partners in the negotiations in Europe.
Anand Sharma, India's Trade Minister, said that "India will do everything it can," to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing a decrease in exports and a reduction in foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We have great challenges, and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a possible option, it's a mandatory condition, because where we find work for tens of millions of our boys and girls."
Others claim that for developing economies like India, there is no point in helping rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutos Varshni, professor at the University of Brown, U.S.A., said that it would be very difficult from a political point of view to provide assistance to Europe for 1.2 billion Indians, some 800 million of whom live for two dollars a day or less.
"At some point, they'll know that the Greeks are retired for 50 years, and they're going to go to sea for holidays, and that's not going to be a good idea," he said.
Lee Howell, Director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India ' s reserves should be used to include Greek numerous and well-paid public sector workers in poorly organized, loss-making enterprises, such as railways.
Mr. Nag said that the eurozone crisis was threatening the "significant direct impact" throughout Asia.
The ABR forecast for the 7.5 per cent growth of the economy in Asia in 2011/12 has now faced “degradable risks” due to threats from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets needed to develop "emergency plans" to protect themselves from the drop and significant capital flows from their economies.
Pentagon ' s terrible warnings of potential defence costs reductions
The Minister of Defence Leon Panetta called on the conference on Monday, warning that the expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and call for a financial response from the Pentagon corridors to the fighting fields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civilian assembly.
The Pentagon is already engaged in a $450 billion reduction in the coming decade, but is now afraid that additional reductions of 600 billion or more may be inevitable if the Congress is unable to reach a cost agreement.
"The consequences of these reductions will be devastating to the Ministry," Panette told Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the inability of the congress to accept the budget agreement and resulting from the so-called sequencing initiated a total reduction of 23 per cent and the termination of many new projects.
"This severe reduction, which is so thoughtless, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible -- you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or building -- and will seriously damage other attempts to modernize," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We will also have to fire many of our state workers and, as a reduction will be made so quickly, we will almost have to fire the state to achieve our goals."
"These changes will undermine the trust of those who support our army and cause serious damage to the military."
The reductions will eventually affect the military," Panetta said.
"If military funding in foreign emergency operations is not directly affected by the sequestration, military achievements are seriously affected by the major deficit in the core budgets," warned the Panel.
" Contractual personnel will be reduced to the end of the cancelled contracts and the supervisory treaty that supports the military."
“The staffing will be reduced, which will lead to delays in payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be violated.”
Two senators wrote the Panel 10 days ago, requesting details of the possible consequences of automatic reductions in the Ministry of Defence.
"As a result of the sequestration in the Ministry of Defence, the United States will be rapidly defeated as the world's leading military power."
"We are persistently opposed to these dragon actions," the senators reported in a joint statement on Monday evening, when they published the letter of the Panel.
"This is not the way we can live with, and this is not the way we have to make ourselves. "
"Secvester is a threat to the national security of the United States, and this cannot be done."
If the text of the Panel or the last warnings of senators to the budgetary compromise or to strengthen the calls for the release of the Pentagon from reductions is introduced, we will see later.
The panel was absolutely sincere about possible reductions, although it had come to work in the Pentagon's leadership after many years of budgetary expertise at Congress and the White House, and aware that it faced a difficult choice.
At the press conference last week, the Minister of Defence drew an unimaginable picture of what could happen next -- an army with a shell but without a kernel.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"This team has no bullets."
"This wing of a plane without enough trained pilots."
"This is a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in her introductory remarks in the Pentagon.
"This is a force that suffers from an unsustainable spirit of warfare, a lack of readiness and unable to fight against potential enemies."
"In fact, it encourages aggression."
In the annex to its letters to McCain and Graham Panette, the new details of how “reductions present significant operational risks: slowing the response to crises, conflicts and disasters; seriously limiting our ability to be the first to deploy and react to the world; and leading to unacceptable risks in future war operations”.
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could face obstacles, including those that had already passed the tests, and some only at the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35 hit-off, a new bomber planned, a new generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal warship and a new ground combat vehicle that the Army and the Marine Pechote need to replace the Khmer.
The further development and testing of F35 can save $80 billion in 10 years, but its supporters say it is vital for the next step to improve and counter the potential threats of China and other opponents.
How to Get Over Lies
The runaway view of the last headlines shows how serious and widespread lies and lies are in everyday life.
The candidate for presidents of the Republics of Herman Kane has been contesting allegations of sexual harassment by several women; each party accuses another in a lie.
The administrations of the University of Pennsylvania had been charged with false testimony, since they allegedly concealed that the retired football coach had raped boys.
Last week, French President Nikola Sarkozy was caught when he told the U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie destroys careers and crushes countries.
The Congressman of New York and Internet Exhibitor Anthony Weiner presented himself as a fool, denying his departures, which was quickly challenged by uncontested evidence.
The former candidate, John Edwards, was charged with financial harassment during a campaign to cover out-of-the-art communications.
And again, none of those living at that time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, who lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Levinski during his second term in office.
The story of fraud in school and college exams is a normal matter.
There have been cases when teachers responded to the tests in order to have a good evaluation of the results of their activities.
The teachers who must teach the contrary send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we deal with?
During one day, as research shows, you can lie from 10 to 200 times.
It is now assumed that much of this is a lie to salvation.
Another study showed that unknown people lied three times in the first 10 minutes of each other’s acquaintance.
The identification of a lie or the identification of a lie is a necessary skill for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike the game of the room, like, say, the charades where it is necessary to call "accused!", the identification of a lie is a serious direction of knowledge based on scientific data collected in the last six decades in prestigious universities engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially on psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most of the old myths of the lie have been dissolved.
Lies are looking in the eye.
They don't always stop, they're stuck, they're red, they're red or they're sweating.
It is not worth concluding that it is difficult for liars to see and expose.
The experienced teller of the lie can come to the truth by observing the structure of the allegations, the myth, the structure of issues and the temporary characteristics.
I spent several years studying scientific discoveries in a wide and constantly growing segment of the knowledge of lies, and it is clear that finding a lie is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps to guide in our difficult world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are better able to read to others, making them feel uncompromising, manage their own emotions, and intuitively feel the way others view them.
We know from the study that extraterrestrials are more often than introverts, that men are more liars about themselves, while women are about others, usually to protect someone's feelings that married people are less vicious to their partners than women (but also the lie that they say most often infrequently).
We also know that if you are perceived as a liar, others will feel less guilty of deceiving you.
What do you mean, someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your object.
It's called "a definition of baseline."
This helps to provide a starting point for further evaluation of the changes.
Watch for a loan, a laugh, and the voice of your object.
You'd better know if a person knocks on his feet constantly in normal condition, then you don't make unfair accusations when you see a knock on his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for a group of misleading verbal and nonverbal actions.
Treat these groups as red flags, not as evidence of deception.
Liars can record the upper part of their body when they try to remember their history, they can put their steps towards the door, turn to the exit, change their poses in a certain way, or demonstrate “the relief after the interview” -- this excessive air of relief and the shift of the poses when all the difficult issues are behind them.
The investigators often falsify the signal of the completion of the interrogation to simply look at the relief after the interview.
So pay attention to your object.
It is known that Scott Peterson withdrew and used his time to claim that his murdered wife was alive, which led to her search for her throughout the country.
Pricing people can also use distance to say, "I didn't have sexual relations with this woman... Miss Levinski" or to repeat the difficult question completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely caught.
Someone can use a "qualification language" when he answers the difficult question, "Well... in truth I speak... how much I know... how much I know."
This makes the response more emotional than actual, and is often a red flag.
There is no magical means to identify a lie, but it is possible to master the art of inventing lies.
These skills will increase the chance of everyone not being a victim of professional and personal skills.
The dispute plan for oil pipeline construction needs to be reviewed after the US threat of delaying its approval
A few days later, after Obama's administration threatened to postpone the approval of the planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- by causing the wrath of trade unions, but by calming the environmental defenders -- the company that is going to build the pipeline, claims that it will be willing to revise the project to resume its work.
TransCanada reported on Monday evening that it would remove the planned oil pipeline from the environmentally sensitive sand dunes area in Nebraska and be sure that the project would still receive approval.
The company sounded this decision at a press conference in the state of Nebraska.
The official representative of TransCanada, Alex Purbass, said that the company remained confident that it would eventually receive approval for the pipeline, although with another route.
This follows a statement by the State Department last week that it will postpone a federal-level decision until it explores new possible routes that do not affect the Nebraska Peschen Holms region and Ogalala aquifer, a huge underground water supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Fox News Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental expertise commissioned by the State Department is likely to reverse the decision before 2013, after the elections next year, although the authorities denied that the decision involved policy.
Obama, in a written statement last week, called for a decision by the State Department and expressed his support.
The oil pipeline shall be 1,700 miles from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He has to transfer 700,000 barrels a day from Albert Province to oil stations in Texas.
To accomplish this, he needs to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by trade unions, which expect about 20,000 oil pipeline-related jobs.
But Nebraska lawmakers, who object to the plan, are considering a bill to speed up the movement from the sand dunes and the Ogalala aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study by the State Department of Environmental Impact showed that the project would only have a limited negative impact on the environment, but a source in the energy industry stated that the Department ' s audit had commissioned a separate review process expert focusing on two issues.
One is a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a advisor to Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign, conflict of interest in the programme.
Another option was the choice of a company that was hired to conduct an initial study was inappropriate, since it was related to TransCanada.
Patty LaBell was tried for allegedly causing the child a lot of fear.
The New York family argues that Patty LaBell's disco-wives began to grow up in the lobby of their home in Manhattan, scaring them to the point of being so scared.
"Lady Marmalade" terrorized 18-month-old Geneva Monk so strongly that she transferred the "change of personality, sleep disorder" and the "strong fear of strangers," her family said in the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
This happened on 10 November last year, when Kevin Monk, his wife, child care teacher, Rosanna, and Geneva were about to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was hunting a car, Rosanna Monk went down to the lobby of the building on Riverside with their luggage, carrying Geneva.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped at the door and dropped her daughter half a minute.
"Someone came back to me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and I went to pick her up," she said.
LaBell's hearty made a statement by a pregnant woman.
"She aggressively said, "You shouldn't have left your daughter at the door," said Rosanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became angry and began to use abuses -- the word "C" and the word "F" -- in increased tone ...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water from the bottle on me.
She said that Geneva had a daughter.
"I told this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBell went to the mother -- who was still holding Geneva -- and her companion had to hold her in the car waiting for her, said Rosann Monk.
The little girl cried so much that she had to die, she added.
Later, the family sent a note to LaBell requesting an apology but did not receive an answer.
Counsel and representatives of LaBell are not responsible for the comments.
The amount of compensation for the damage is not reported, but the family lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he had taken the case free of charge and that the family planned to sacrifice any money that would benefit children with painful cancer.
"The goal is to make Patty LaBell take responsibility for his actions," said Davis.
"This behavior is totally unacceptable, especially with regard to a child with an 18-month-old child in his arms."
Climate challenges have slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario Lopez's governance in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labour market increased, foreign funding decreased, and the economy was weakened.
The year 2011 will come into the economic history of Sinaloa as the first year of the Government of Mario Lopez Valdes, also called the year of change, which gave rise to great hopes for economic development, but given the adverse climate conditions of the beginning of the year, there has been no growth, but a reduction in the basic economic development indicators has been recorded.
Low temperatures in February have not only led to the loss of millions of farmers, but have limited the growth potential of the public economy by reducing economic activity by a total of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly due to the historical decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, affecting the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to the report on areas affected by the freeze provided by the Mexico Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 835,582 hectares were affected, 78.03 per cent of which had been completely affected and the remaining 21.07 per cent had been partially affected.
The decline in economic activity led to a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, in the first three quarters of the country, an accelerated increase in unemployment, from January to March 55,053 people in Sinaloa were unemployed, from 4.53 per cent in the second quarter to 5.28 per cent in the second quarter, and from September to September, it continued to grow to 6.19 per cent, which accounted for more than 74,000 people in Sinaloa.
Liquidity reduction
In Sinaloa, unemployment is covered by many factors over the year, for economist Gerardo Lopez Servantes, Director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly by actions undertaken in public policy.
"What we see now is an increase in unemployment, which is linked to several factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market, in order to limit the resources imposed by the law that was adopted at the congress to combat money-laundering, since people who illegally own dollars are simply working with them, investing and using them in something," he said.
Fixed immigration
Lopez Servantes said there is still a demographic factor in unemployment.
“The number of people who leave the country in search of work abroad has been limited in the United States, primarily due to the difficulties of entry, and secondly, since once they have gone, they are already experiencing very many difficulties in finding work, so the group of people remains and demands jobs here in the state as a result of increasing unemployment”, he said.
Violation of formal requirements
The analysis of the labour market of Sinaloa has become worse if a large number of violations that prevail under the labour conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the state ' s active population is working without being mentioned as workers in a social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and abuses in the formulation, another reminder of work in the state is provided by low wages; in the state the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute for Social Welfare and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of the Sinaloa workers was 5,352 pesos by September, much below the country ' s average of 7,375 pesos.
Reduction of FDI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the high unemployment rate in 2011, the largest flow of foreign direct investment over the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, was $630,697 from January to July, representing a decrease of 87.74 per cent compared to $5,143,312 during the same period last year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development has recorded only 17,280,000 pesos of investment during the year, which have mainly come to companies in the field of services.
Long
In the light of the economic downturn, the Government requested the approval of a loan of 3 billion pesos at the State Congress in July, which would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, a total of 2,600 million pesos were approved at the local level, and no debt benefits were expected in any sector of the state economy until November.
Reactions
For business representatives in the first year of the Government, Mario Lopez Valdez demonstrated a lack of government capacity.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, President of the National Chamber of Commerce, said that during 2011, there was no agreement on the wishes of the various sectors, including the Government alone.
"The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa this year has really been low, it has to work a lot to restore the positions lost this year, in 2012 we must double our efforts, we have not been able to agree on all efforts and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new Government team, we hope that the next year will be much better," he said.
Reduction of the economy
Lopez Loredo said that events such as early freezes had stopped the state's economy this year and its efficiency and growth were limited.
"Low economics are the result of several events, including frost, one of the main effects was a slow economy, which is not becoming fast enough to create economic dynamics, which allows for a reasonable level of processes, goods and services, and, therefore, at the end of the year, we close it down to our expectations," he said.
Revision of direction
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederation of Employers of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, said that the state should continue its most dynamic productive activity.
“In general, we have found that we have been working on this, we believe that a long-term programme that will redefine the direction and economic course of the state must mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has,” he said.
Future work
President Coparmex stressed the importance of defining the future direction to better direct the Government ' s efforts.
"In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration had demonstrated progress in its own way in the conduct of public policy.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the Government is beginning to get involved in work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the Government is aware that much more is needed," he said.
He's sentenced to 20 pounds [8 kg] of marijuana
Five years of imprisonment and a 100-day income penalty, such a sentence was imposed on the citizen of Navalo for the storage of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office reported that the convicted drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valensuel Sandoval, convicted of a crime against health, was in this case holding marijuana for the purpose of distribution.
According to case AP/SIN/CLN 687/2010/MI, Valencia Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 while patrolling the street of Cyprus Valdes, ahead of post No. 80 in the city of El-Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was behind the white truck pickup, carrying a black bag in a box in the car, and on the passenger seat was a small backpack, where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the detention was transferred to the Second District Court and the accused continued to remain in prison at the Centre for the Legal Impact of Crimes.
Contributions to work should be made
Public work related to programmes such as the Family, the Saving of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants is likely to remain uncompleted or long-term because of the lack of funds, Miguel Ángel Lopez Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development pointed out that, although work programmes have so far developed, they are in danger because the Government is unable to make appropriate contributions, which amount to over 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding of all three programmes was about 50 million pesos, of which 25 per cent had to be made by the state, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality had provided resources for work, so it was still possible to delay their completion.
"They have to invest almost 12 million, and even if the year is over, they have not given us any digs when they were to give us a share from early July," he said, "to avoid delaying, we started work and they moved very fast, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesus Agilar Padili, the state did not make the contributions it had to make, so at the beginning of the period of the administration of the municipality, it had to make money to cover more than 7 million, which had not been provided by the State administration in that case.
"This happened to us in the previous administration because the state had no financial opportunities to participate, and the programmes continued to develop, and this year, in order to gain access to these programmes, we need to find resources to cover what the state should remain," he explained.
While the State authorities had an obligation to provide these resources, he said that the request had been made on behalf of the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Vilareal, to increase efforts to ensure that the percentages of the resources concerned had come as soon as possible.
"They've got to pay almost 12 million, and even if the year is over, they haven't given us any digs."
The Court will approve the "digital television transition" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals into digits is one of the most important changes that have been achieved in recent years.
The Supreme Court (VC) rejected the constitutional claims made by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, which bore the so-called “transition to digital television” from 2021 to 2015, as there were no eight votes required to cancel it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Sylvo Mess, felt that President Felipe Calderon had not exceeded his mandate by issuing a decree with a detailed description of action for the transition to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate were rejected because of the lack of a qualified majority of eight votes necessary for the court to speak on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and it remained in force.
The draft statement prepared by Minister Olgoi Sanchez Cordero proposed that the decree be declared unconstitutional because the regulation of the radio and television programme is a law enshrined in the law of the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel) in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanches Cordero voted for the project.
On this basis, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to challenge the decree and support the complaints, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions referred to in it regarding the transition to digital broadcasting.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to reject the request of the Chamber of Deputies not to enter into the discussion of the project, also under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the project ' s arguments that the federal executive authority could not determine the general rules of the measure to be prepared by the State administration.
"I also do not believe that if this happened, it would affect the autonomy of the governing body," and I recalled that the planning of public policy in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, is relevant to the federal executive authority, which has a constitutional mandate, the government.
The replacement of analog signals to numbers - one of the most important changes in recent years - has led to better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, he said, would mean the deferral of benefits from conversion to digital form, which includes meeting social needs, which not only has a technical dimension, “as it covers economic, social, political and national security”.
These issues, he said, “needs the work of the entire system established by the principle of government economic governance to include a group of authorities which the Constitution brings together into the State executive authority.”
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the digital broadcast and had done so through the executive authority, despite the existence of extra-special technical facilities.
It cannot be concluded from this that the Government, by adopting the decree under discussion, which in any case affects the competence of the Congress, ensures administrative compliance with the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, said.
In Michoakana, they analyze the possibility of counting the vote.
According to data transmitted to the PRTR, the difference between the first and second seats in the governorate elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes of 879 from the total number of protocols 6.074.
The possibility of counting “voting” was real, with regard to the electoral process in Michoakan this year, where, according to the data from the Programme of Preliminary Results of Elections (PRI), the difference between the first and the second seats in the governorate elections was only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes of 879 of the total number of protocols 6.074.
In this light, the President of the Board of Generals of the Miquelon Elections Institute (IMM), Maria de Los Angeles Líanderal Saragos, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral corps adopted a package of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
As should be recalled, Michoakan did not adopt the Constitution or the Electoral Code of the State or the Electoral Law Act, as the Congress approved the reforms of the State shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in this electoral process, and Governor Leonel Gódoi Engelel did not include his publication within the time limits set out in the Law in the Official Journal of the State, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (JIU) decided on a constitutional claim issued by the local legislative assembly and called the “invalid and illegal” vote of the representative of the State on constitutional reform, since he does not have the right to “allow or support them”.
In an interview with the possibility of “voting” Maria de los Ángeles Lünderal, she said that by adopting the appropriate principles, the General Council of VAT would allow a partial or full count of votes to be taken by the local electoral authority.
Thus, a partial recalculation of one or more electives may be made on the condition that: the results of the protocols do not match; there is no minutes of vote and count of documents in the minutes or is not in the chair; or where there are obvious errors or corrections in the minutes.
In addition, the overall re-calculation of votes in all ballots may take place when there is a sign that the difference between the alleged candidate and those who received the second place in the vote is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from the party representative and/or a coalition that has issued the second of those candidates.
A general vote recalculation will also be made if, at the end of the ordinary count, it is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate who took the second place is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that there is a request from the political party to which the candidate took the second place, in the event of the exclusion of the electoral ballots that have been taken into account in the partial recalculation.
It should be noted that in this situation there are elections in Morelia, where, according to the APR, the difference between the first and the second places is only 0.16 per cent, even without the opinion of 129 votes in the total number of Protocol 923.
His Last Will
His dust will be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinam, the family confirms.
The rest of the pilot Felipe Basio Cortez arrived at Saltillo, his home town on Sunday evening; on Monday, a visit and a relaxing meal was held.
According to the family, the Colonel's last will was to unravel his dust in the mountains of Sapalinam.
After the condolences with other people who died in a disaster, the Basio Cortez family returned to Coauil City on board the Mexican Air Force aircraft, and the closest people attended the ceremony at Campo Marta.
In the afternoon the Colonel’s dust arrived at the time of the bullfight of Nazario Ortis Garcia, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 a.m., he attended the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and the football team, who was a member of Felipe Basio during high school education.
"His wish was to return to Saltillo, and to have his dust spread in the mountains of Sapalinam, he always said it to his family and friends," said Sandra Cortes Basio, the pilot's sister.
In her view, the Colonel has fulfilled all his dreams, she believes that he was at the heart of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son and a loving brother, devoted to his family."
Felipe Cortez Basio left the city of Saltillo very young to go to Sappano Airport, Halisco.
Some did not believe him, they said that he had a head even in the truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew, Jorge Alberto Davil Basio, will remember him as a very good man, "as soon as he came to Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him as he brought Marta Saagun to Saltillo."
He remembers that even when he was seven years old, he went to Sappan to give his family's diplomas, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: managing a plane.
It's being conducted in the last way.
Shots were fired in honour of Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortez Basio, led by Governor Jorge Torres Lopes, people from the village and government, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force themselves, the leaders and students of the High School of Technology in Saltillo, where he was studied in 1985 and was successful in training and in sports.
Basio Cortez died recently when the helicopter he managed suffered was violated, together with the Secretary of the Government of the Province, José Francisco Blake Moroy, and six others, all representatives of the Ministry.
At 18:05, the remnants of Basio Cortez (crimated), the inhabitants of Saltillo, arrived to be transferred to the funeral office of the members of the Mexican Air Force, headed by Major James Martines, to the training school, where he was already awaiting his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife, Christine, her mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three bodies were found on the L.L.C. farm
Within hours of the discovery, the military authorities showed eleven people in the media who had been detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in various parts of the body with a controlled shot at a abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadreita Hymenez, Nuevo Leon.
The discovery was found at 1.5 kilometers of the Cadreitt's horse on the side of Santiago, at the height of the commune known as El Castillo.
Several passersby noticed that in the village house, whose wall was decorated in a runaway and brown, the door was open.
When they looked inside, literally three feet [3 m], they found the bodies of three people, and they immediately informed the authorities.
One man was dressed in a yellow football with black jeans, without shoes, and next to him was another man in a white mother.
Almost one metre was the body of another man, in red skirts and blue jeans.
All three were lying face down.
According to evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere, as there was no gilding in the place.
There are signs of one organized criminal group of another in the village house, as well as several holes in the doors.
11 caught in the Cadreite
The Ministry of National Security introduced 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group, which was mainly in the municipality of Cadereit, and who were accused of kidnapping, murder, "female" and secret funerals.
According to the information published, on 11 November, eight persons were detained in the Los Alvero colony and one person in hostages was saved.
They were provided with three homes and a telephone, requiring them to become members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
Another event took place on 12 November at 06:00 a.m., military personnel were on a patrol trip to the village of Staroe Rancho in Kadereita, when he saw the car with two men in the living room.
When they were stopped and inspected, the military found a rifle, a cartridge, and 18 cartridges.
Later, on 13 November at 14:00 a.m., one of their partners was stationed on the public land of La Pradad, which, having seen the military, tried to flee.
He is accused of undercover funerals in the municipalities of General Teran, China and Cadereita.
A new Italian Government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present a new Government that will face the crisis that put that country on the brink of an economic disaster.
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present a new Government that faces the crisis that has put Italy at the forefront of the economic disaster and has damaged the entire euro area.
A statement from the presidential court stated that Monty, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President George Napoleon on Wednesday to confirm that he could form a government.
It is expected that it will present an office composed mainly of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive authority will take its position.
Monty said he would present to the President the results of his negotiations with political parties in his attempt to form a Government.
"I want to confirm my full confidence in our country's ability to leave this difficult period," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monty did not directly say that he could form a government, but a tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
"The structure is now well defined," he said.
Monty completed the process of forming a government less than three days, which is much less common, as Italy has struggled with the political and financial crisis that has raised their debt to a critical level.
The administration, under the leadership of former European Commissioner Monty, should approve the package of a rigorous economy required by European leaders to restore confidence in Italy.
On the basis of the pressure on Monty to speed up, unstable markets have established a 10-year-old Italian BTP bond income of more than 7 per cent, at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marchegalia, the leader of the Italian Federation of Employers, told reporters after a meeting with Monty: "We said we would actively support this Government."
We believe that it is the Government's last chance to get out of this critical situation.
Monty's chances of success were largely based on the support of Silvio Berlusconi's LDP party, which was forced to retire on Saturday because of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monty's efforts should lead to a good outcome," said the reporters Angelino Alfano, the Secretary of the Party's right-wing centre.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the majority of the government, consisting of the technocrats formed by Monty.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monty must have strong parliamentary support for reforms that are likely to be unpopular with harsh economic reforms.
Any blocking or stopping of these attempts may lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has intensified the pressure, warning that Monty's failure could be a disaster.
Monty began consultations on Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women ' s organizations.
He'll finish the chain of his meetings Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on Sunday Napolitano, which allowed a very rapid transition to the crisis.
After a short break at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would retire, Italy's debt has now reached a critical level in the face of uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister would be successful.
Saving Italy with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for modern eurozone financial defenders.
Monty said that his Government would be in place until the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite widespread forecasts that policies would only give him time to reform before appointing new elections.
Monty said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the main parties insisted that he should be made up only of technical experts, proof of their dissatisfaction with the financial situation affecting the process.
Political sources reported that the mutual mistrust and disagreement of parties made it difficult to include political figures.
Spanish people have more gaming experience than Ticos
Of the 22 players reported in Spain, ten have already played 50 international matches.
On behalf of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 alleged players played 50 matches.
A minor contrast with Costa Rica, when compared to 22 players from both countries to a match match today at 3:05 a.m. at the San José National Stadium.
While the world and Europe champions, the number one in the FIFA monthly rating, have a whole list of class A games, Tricolor has only the defender Michael Humana as the only one who has held 50 international games.
This figure was achieved last Friday in the game against Panama (0-2) at the Rommel Fernandez Stadium.
Spanish football players playing all the stars in the League and in the strong British Premier League clubs were very active in the League and in the local Cup matches this year, and they were high-level players in the European Cups and the League of Champions.
To this end, the experience of the Spanish Furo must be added in a complex qualification in the Euro or the World Championship.
The Tikos players, however, have limited international experience in the area of CONCAFF, which is considered the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that he is leading a list in the Spanish collection of golfer Iker Kasilias, which last Sunday against England (a 0-1 match played in London) repeated the record of ex-golper Andoni Subisarreta, with 126 international winners.
Casilias is playing against Tricolor today and will set a new record in 127 international fighters for Spain.
Havi Ernandes, Barcelona player, 106 matches.
Casilias and Hawaii were recognized as the best in the last week of the WEFA together with the other Iberian team, Subisarreta, with 126 fighters and the Raul González bomber Shalke Raul, with 102.
Almost close to a hundred Carles Puyol with 97 games.
Havi Alonso follows them from 91, Fernando Torres - from 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos - from 81, Andres Inesta - from 62, Sesk Fabregas - from 61 and David Silva - from 53.
On the side of Costa Rica, next to Michael Humana, left side Hunior Dias with 48 matches and Bryan Ruis bomber, from 45.
Next, only five crossed the border in 30 games: Kaylor Avas from 31, Randall Asfeifa from 32, Mikhael Barrantes from 31, Carlos Ernandes from 36 and José Luis Lopes from 35.
The remaining ones.
More than 30 matchrs in Spain in Gerar Pike (37), Sergio Buskets (36), Santiago Santa Casarla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiola (31).
With less than 30 exits on the field, Roy Miller has 26 matches, Winston Parks, 26 Gabriel Badilla, 25 and Roy Muri, 23.
The remaining ones have not even reached 20.
As for Nacho Moreal's only four games, and Hordi Alba's two games, in Costa Rica, Victor Bolivar's only one, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet won.
The leading Spanish game, David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres from 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruis became the one who brought more points twice as many as Carlos Ernandes and three times as many as Roy Muri and Parks.
Quintet has put the country on tour in honor of the twenty-year career
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream coming.
In an exclusive interview with Viva bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam, the group was ready to give one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
It was more than 20 years of expectation, but the group said it was also their dream of being a reality to play in that country.
This was a statement by a bassist and founder, Jeff Amenta, who gave an exclusive interview with Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is located in South America as part of the tour for the twenty-year period of work and on Sunday, 20 numbers, will make its only stop in Central America.
On that day, they will attend the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with a team from Los Angeles The X and the local group of Las Robertas.
It's a part of the conversation, the full decryption of which is available online at The Nation.
For your Costa Rica fans, it's a dream that Pearl Jam is playing in Costa Rica?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream coming for us too.
It's just our second visit to South and Central America, and it's all going well.
I was in Costa Rica only once -- on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
That's why we're so happy to bring our music there.
I'm asking because there's some loyalty to the group; fans live in tension days before the concert.
What will you say to your most devoted fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we're sorry that it took us so long to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, refer to him as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the past 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We've had some great shows in San Paulo, and we hope this has brought us into the shape of this concert in Costa Rica.
Actually, we really want to play here.
We love this country, we love to deal with serfings and jungles, as far as these two things are concerned, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and her surfing waves?
We've got a lot of friends, and I've got a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are amazing.
My friends always go to Serfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, as well as in Mexico, these are great places for serfing, as we know, from people who love serfing.
Looking at the tour, you can say you did a great show with a lot of songs.
What were you planning to do in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, we don't have any limits on what we can do.
We're trying to make the best show of the most varied songs possible; we're trying to play a few songs from each album and give our fans a great variety of repertoires.
You never repeat a repertoire.
How does it work?
I think that's partly because we have nine tiles and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in tune and surprises us because it reminds us of why we loved those songs and why we could forget.
That makes the show more interesting to us, and that's why I think it makes it more interesting to people.
That's what you've been doing for 20 years.
Looking back, it's hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us could ever imagine that we're in a rock group and that we've been doing this for over 20 years makes it like a dream.
We are pleased with our successes and we are very excited that we can continue to create music together.
We all love each other and love to create music.
We're happy to go to places in the world where we always wanted to go.
It's all very good for us.
What does it mean to be a large part of the branch?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of large collections.
We're good friends with guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's healthy when the movement grows out of a group of friends, and that's unusual.
From time to time, a group from one city appears, but much more strange when five or ten groups appear at the same time in one city.
We are proud and honored to be part of a group from Seattle.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw the Soundgarden during their tour, so we were happy to be friends with them all and to us we were honored to be part of the sound of Seattle that came.
It is also very strange that the group of your kind stays together for so long.
Yes, four of us were 21 together, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than many groups.
First of all, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and second of all, we'll take care of others.
We are all very close friends, and thanks to this, we have also opened up the musical pathways that give every free experimenter.
We trust each other's music, and everything could not be better.
Your attitude toward the word of glory was not easy, but thanks to your success, you were able to do everything you wanted.
How are you on the balance?
When we grew up, it became easier to find a balance.
We'll take care not to be too long in the tour, because it's easy to get into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember people here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what it did, not to be famous or to be rock star, which none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we're writing really good songs, and at first it was great.
We have been a group for almost three years and have not released any albums until the end of Andy Woods.
It was a lot of disappointment because it took so long, and most importantly, that we still have close friends with Bruce (Ferveser) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the group, and when I hear a song or I see a photo, I think of the amazing person that Endie was, and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and so on.
He was a great man, and we miss him.
The local group of Las Robertas will be responsible for opening a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you're familiar with her work, especially Eddie Wedder, and that's why you chose her to open?
Yes, the producers sent us a few video suggestions, and this was a group that we liked most, so we don't have to wait to see that Las Robertas could be useful, and that should be very exciting.
Why do you keep changing the words at Yellow Ledbetter at the concerts?
That's Eddy Wedder's question, so I don't know.
He's playing it, and I think he's using the first thing in his head.
Who influenced you like a bassista?
So many of them.
Among the first to come to mind, Gizer Butler, John Entvisll, Si J Ramon, John Dow, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukovski...
They're so many that I can talk all day about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the border up to date, even though it was no longer fashionable?
I think we're all feeling a bit of brittleness from the words of the branch.
When I think of him, he reminds me of the groups I mentioned earlier, the Mudhoney, the Soundgarden, the Nirvana and all that appeared at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's great, because it's the music that's worth listening to, and the Mudhoney teams now create music better than ever.
At first, your music was darker, and now it's more positive.
How would you explain this change?
That's interesting, because, I think, there are some songs in the album that might seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark, even though they might sound a little positive.
From both of them when Ed played them, I cried when I heard them, those songs were very dark.
I think when you grow up, and there was some trauma in your life, and you lost a family member or another, these events start to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect this for me.
So, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to create dark music.
Peru:
Fuhimori was again hospitalized for medical examination
The former president, Alberto Fuhimori, was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital, his family doctor informed him of the loss of his muscle.
Fuhimori, 72, who is sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including language cancer, which has led him to surgery four times and is under surveillance.
Congressman Alejandro Agigna, who is his personal physician, told TV channel N that Fuhimori would be examined in three days at the National Institute of Non-Plastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in its lower limbs.
Agigna said that he believed that Fuhimori should be a candidate for the benefit of forgiveness from humanitarian considerations; however, he said that he did not want it because he knew that he was innocent.
He carried four operations into the language, lost 18 kilograms of weight, added other diseases, such as strong erosion gastritis, fertilized iron oxides, hip stones, high blood pressure, and blood pressure problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fuhimori has been in prison since September 2007, in the National Police Office for Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 persons by the forces of the destruction of the army, which acted in secret in the first years of his reign.
Music is being sent to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, headed by the President of Uruguay, José Muhika and consisting of several ministers and businessmen, will be visiting Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and to begin negotiations on the political problems of the region.
Muhika will meet with her Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderon, next Wednesday, the most important item in the comprehensive plan of meetings with the political, commercial and community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, as announced by the Uruguayan leadership.
The meeting of the two presidents in Guadalar will be “beneficial for the exchange of information on political relations between the two nations”, as the South American leadership published on its website.
According to local media, Muhika is seeking to support Calderon for Uruguay in an incident with France, which occurred when French President Nikola Sarkozi included the South American country in a tax letter at the G20 meeting in the French city of Kane.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to remove those countries that remained tax havens from the international community, a statement that provoked a protest in Uruguay and responded to the advice of his Ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group established from the most developed and developing countries, and, in fact, with the South American country since January this year, an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has sought to speed up the conclusion of tax-sharing agreements to leave this “serious list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development made up of countries that do not benefit from international tax cooperation standards.
With regard to the trade plan, the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) has been in force since 2004 in Mexico and Uruguay, which has increased trade between the two countries.
The watertight conductor will be three-dimensional with Super Mario 3D Land.
Super Mario fought continuously for more than 25 years to save Princess Pitch from the evil lap of the Bower, but never before did he do so in three dimensions: in Super Mario 3D Land he will fight for the love of the girl in stereoscopy technology.
The publication, which will appear in stores around the world this month, has been created taking into account the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS port console, which allows to play in three dimensions without the need to use points.
"Mario is a hero who has to tell you how to work stereoscopy without glasses," said Nintendo's head of press in Spain, Omar Alvarez, at the time of the Madrid game.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game specially developed under this platform", because so far successful products such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" have been adaptations to existing games.
The representative of Nintendo said that, despite the existence of 3D, Super Mario 3D Land is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and moving game.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part "simple" to attract less experienced users.
On one occasion, most experts will go "on the second round" to the levels of games that are more complex for this time.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or those who only affect the depth of action, but who need to play in three dimensions in order to overcome various obstacles and "do not yield to optical illusions".
This invasion of Super Mario in three dimensions also marks the return of the hero to the port console, which has not taken place since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo is migrating to the fans of the series and repeating a successful formula from the previous games, the watertight guide must go through dangerous abandoned platforms to free Princess Pich.
However, the game will discover new movements, decorations, costumes and enemies, as well as the "playing" of Luigi.
Colombo guarantees the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Alvaro Colom said on Tuesday that Alfonso Portillo's extradition process began to respond to a 70 million-dollar lease in the United States.
This is the end of the process by which Guatemala responded to the request of the northern country that demanded the extradition of Portillo to judge it there.
At the Coloque press conference, his decision was related to the independence of the judicial and executive authorities, taking into account that the Court of First Instance had already signed an extradition.
He claimed that during his term of office, he had not “applied his hands” to legal decisions and had adopted all the extradition procedures he had ever known.
Along with Portillo Sergio Ruano Marrokin, he will be extradited for murder and serious bodily injury, as well as Edgar Estrad Morales and Viktor Estrad Paradez, both for drug trafficking.
What Coloma has done shows the executive process after all legal and constitutional courts have been exhausted to prosecute the ex-head of the State from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CSC), the Portillo will be extradited once, with its legal status in Guatemala and the guarantee of its human rights.
The portal was recognized as innocent in the Q120 million draft in the Ministry of Defence during the presidential term, which was a process of previous extradition, but the Ministry of Public Relations appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was set up to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of the Trinijove Social Support Organization are important: 6,000 young people facing social isolation have helped to cope with difficult situations during this fourth century.
It is worth adding more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
The anniversary was the occasion for the ceremony held at the old Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people arrived.
Trinijove appeared in the light near the Trinity of Wales in 1986 to help young people with a lack of education, lack of work and drug problems or marginalization.
Yesterday's Sant Andreu celebration brought together a large number of responsible organizations and agencies that had been working with the association for the past 25 years.
The various political representations during the elections have shown the unity of work done by Trinijove.
After the President of the Generality, Artura Massa, and his predecessor, Hordi Puhola, attended the ceremony, former Socialist Education Adviser Ernest Maragal, and former Mayor and current Ecosocialist, a member of the City Council, Ricardo Goma.
Also appeared in Fabra I Coats, the current Social Welfare and Family Consultant, Josep Luis Claris and the Social Work of La Caixa, Haume Lanaspa.
He said that Trinijove appeared in a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but added that the work that has been done so far “is a good basis”.
The President cited Trinijove as an example of the fight against bad conditions and the hope of people experiencing difficulties.
"The crisis is not new for the organization and work done by it," he said.
Captured building, where mass parties were organized, was evacuated
Catchers occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on Balmes Street, 51
12 occupiers left the building yesterday afternoon without fighting
It seems that the nightmares of neighbors living in the house 51 on Balmes Street have come to an end.
Yesterday, 12 people volunteered to leave the building, which they illegally occupied and where they organized mass parties that upset neighbors, as the court ruled, without interference from the police.
When the operation was completed, the lock on the door was changed to prevent the recurrence of the situation.
"From now on, there will be a check-in," said the manager.
The quays, which occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the others settled, allocated all electricity and some water, broke down the walls and left traces of a variety of types, especially alcohol banks.
The first three floors were a place for the mass dinners that lasted up to two days and upset the owners.
Right behind the building is a night club, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied, its income had fallen by 80 per cent.
The club's owner says that the building's captors got her into an unfair competition because they sold drinks for three euros, while at the club for ten.
Furthermore, the discotheque owner should have responded to the complaints of the neighboring, although, as she noted, the noise was caused not by visitors to the club but by residents of the neighborhood and, above all, by those who attended the parties that were organized there, the frequency and intensity of which had increased, as the angry neighbors said.
The owner of the club said that the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and that's nine months ago, as he "forgives" her rent.
The City Police also confirmed that over the past few weeks, more complaints had been received from neighbors to the situation.
The president of the PP Municipal Group, Alberto Fernando Dias, called for “to evacuate the building immediately last week in order to address the problems of coexistence and general spirit in the neighbourhood and degradation in this area”.
The popular leader explained that by summer only one floor of the building had been occupied, but in the last few months the squatters had invaded all the floors and virtually every room and that some of them had broken.
In that sense, he added that “it is necessary to end impunity and to stand firm against the culture of the building.”
So yesterday, police officers evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 15:30, the police left on Montral Street, 35 after receiving a telephone call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountains?
Architects agree with the possibility of a competition after the recommendations of contributions
The 16-door municipal competition resumed the debate on the role of Kolserola in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, at the rise of the present-day Barcelona City Corporation (CSC), the administration printed a newsletter for Kolserola.
The booklet described the mountain as a large park of the Barcelona capital.
Moreover, this was accompanied by a comparison of pictures with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the SCB, in 1987 the park again took place in many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few, not north-south-oriented, but up (top) down (the sea).
The position of Kolserol as a natural park is contrary to that idea.
The prototype was not the Central Park, but Yellowauston, with a wild cabin in the role of Yogi Bear.
This was so until, in September, the Council announced huge competitions consisting of 16 competitions for a number of other gates in Coliseum.
There's no doubt about the idea of a park under the door.
Either way, or someone wants to put the door on the field.
The question is, Is it Colserola or a park or a mountain?
The competitions, and their organizational side, and their impact on the city, are a topic for discussion of all the architects of Barcelona.
This is hardly the most repetitive topic discussed when two members of this group of elected people know each other in the elevator.
And this fact leads to one of the few coincidences between what three architects of Barcelona and the scientists who were present.
Miguel Rolldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: the competition is appropriate
For Roland, once the shoreline is reached, it becomes “necessary” to discuss the “former side of the mountain” when the offer by Ildefon Serda, a mountain with green apples, has not been made.
"It's necessary to allow the largest Barcelona Park to be a beach.
Besides, thanks to his excellent access.
Kolserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Cosserola Gate" contains "word hunting": we should not think of them as "the entrance to the park, but as the limitation of some areas where we should act."
The model, like Roland and Bayona, with experience in urban construction, called the "intellectual task" with "some dangers".
The risks arising from the “uncertainty of public space forecast” after the experience of the 1980s, which ended at the Forum’s “Singing of its small songs”.
The first fear is that it's a limit where you can build.
"Restriction of something is the preparation of the next step", there is a transition.
"We need to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [as regards the General Capital Plan (GSP)] can lead to real disaster."
Close to the point, Modola believes that the simplicity of the Colserol valley "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, not" as a purely topographic issue.
The model recalls that there is already work done outside Calserola, which is “not to be missed by the ear”, although he is grateful for the opportunity that Mary offers his profession to enter the project “from the beginning”.
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a gap that allows architects to enter the debate, but “he doubts” whether this technical profile is that it should be led by interdisciplinary teams (“success”, he argues), which should have been created: “Architors should be only a tool”.
Bayona argues that the answer to the question that calls for this part is complex, since the rules of the competition do not cover the general nature of the Colserola: "There have been 16 cross-currency contests, he says, in the sense of the sea-mountain, but there is no lengthy reading here to see and understand the area as a whole."
This requires, at least in his case, the participation of 16 competitions.
On the other hand, the project for one gate can be crossed by programme and defined by the project architect for the next gate.
From your point of view, it is appropriate to ensure that the area is directly above Ronda de Dalt to provide the area fully equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrasabal and he will be released
After 72 days of settlement, the judicial representative of Red Casino forgave Major Monterey's brother in the proceedings against him on charges of extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be released after the legitimate representative of Red Casino has given him forgiveness before the Second District Criminal Court, which is conducting an appeal against Brother Mary Monterrey.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, the owner of Red Casino, Sergio Gil Garcia, published a series of photos and videos, where apparently Manuel Jonas demanded an economic contribution to allow Monterey's authorities to operate a secret operation in a burning house.
After a public conviction, the Public Prosecutor General opened a criminal case against the brother of the mayor and was arrested and sentenced to 30 days in prison on 2 September.
After four hours before an agent of the State Ministry of Offences, he was sent to a temporary prison in the old part of the capital of the State.
He remained in that place for 49 days, following the requirements of the second order for the prohibition of displacement after the prosecutor had eliminated the crime of bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Cadereita, claiming to have been sentenced to half a million pesos by the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in prison, with the average degree of isolation of prisoners, because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue in the municipal prison in San Nicholas, Garze.
On 25 October, the arrest warrant was issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Janes, who said that, after almost two months of investigation, the evidence of Jonah ' s guilt was clearly enough, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos from bookmakers in exchange for the authorization of the operation.
On Monday, the legitimate representative of Red Casino, Viktor Aldo Garcia Gomez, presented Judge José Luis Pesin to apologize for the brother of the mayor of the region, so that he could be released in the next few hours.
During the trial, the Public Prosecutor at the Court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomez whether he had compensated for the damage and which of the partners in the burnt house was apologizing, although the lawyer tried not to make a name.
Based on records 197/2011, the legal pardon was granted to Jonas Larrasabal, and no statements could subsequently be made concerning the process that was planned against him, nor would any compensation be required.
Following the hearing of the legal representative of the bookstores, at almost 15:50, it was proposed to release Larrasabal Breton immediately.
The court official, Jorge Janes, went to San Nicolas Municipal Prison in Garze to inform Jonah that he was legally forgiven and his case would be closed.
He will also inform him of the immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionysio Pérez Hakome tells about the details of the disaster, where the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, and seven more people died.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (IST) reported that the results of an accident, during which the Minister of the Interior of France Blake Mora and seven others were killed, showed that the helicopter had hit the ground directly in full integrity without attempting to land the pilot.
During the Dionysio Pérez Hacome press conference, the Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the airship got up, the pilot discovered that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The elements that seem to show that the ship had several contact from the ground, the wings came into contact with the trees at 25 meters where the device had lost the flux."
He also reported that the vessel was intended for 19 persons, respectively, to meet the requirements for the carriage of persons.
He also said that the studies carried out in the impact area did not indicate the existence of parts on the ground.
"The study reported that there were no components of the ship elsewhere, and the impact was structurally complete.
"The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, which met the relevant passenger transport requirements.
The land in this place has a distance from seven to 30 degrees.
To date, the Secretary said, chiefly, to obtain results as soon as possible; however, the study could take several months or even one year.
In the meantime, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, Director General of Airports and Support Services, said that during the attack, the presidential helicopter was at a cruising speed and that it was at a soft climbing ground.
"This information reinforces the hypothesis of the usual flight maneuver at the time of the impact," he said.
At the press conference, the owner of the SCT, Prés Hakome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aviation rules, the flight was conducted under the visual flight rules, which means that the team should have visibility during flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports identified appropriate conditions for flight when the aircraft was sent to the border area between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, where low altitude clouds were observed.
Selected routes:
Perhaps because of the cloudy conditions of the team, the area of lower altitude and higher visibility in the valley of Kuernavak may have been sought.
The place hits.
The coordinates of the impact and the last entries from the aircraft radar are likely to coincide with no loss of control or change of flight direction prior to the impact.
Small-scale bulkheads:
The information available so far indicates that the impact has come on the front and back line.
The dispersal of the clouds suggests that the helicopter met with the ground under structural integrity.
No apparent signs of fire or explosion were found:
The disaster zone remains undetected evidence in the wreckage of the ship, some kind of explosion or fire.
The results of recent studies show that multiple land contact could occur.
During field work, aircraft pieces were found at a height of 9,200 feet above sea level, and the land has a distance from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it was destroyed on its way.
The information contains facts that seem to indicate that the helicopter could have several collisions from the ground.
After a thorough study in a larger area than the area near the site where the disaster occurred, there were no scattered parts of the aircraft, which reinforced the assumption that the impact had occurred in a structural integrity environment.
MSS announces a gene search program for obesity
Social protection leads to a study on the search for the gene of obesity in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Protection (MSSI) announced that a study was being carried out to detect obesity in children and young people, who received the title of the protocol “Genetics of Pregnancy in Children and Adolescents”, which would provide an account of the signs of overweight.
In his statement, the Head of the Medical Research Unit for Biochemistry of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the twenty-first century, Miguel Crus Lopes explained that a multi-profile team of therapists, nurses, dietologists and social workers had been gathered.
This team is assisted by specialists and graduates of the National Institute of Health (NIPH) and the Centre for Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Institute of Politics (NPI).
The study invited the population (written or not) to participate in the MSSI sports centres participating in the study in the valley of Mexico, where every Saturday, will be tested with children from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol had begun to lead in the sport centre in Kuwaito (West of Mexico), and since 8 October activities had taken place in the sports centre in Nesaualkoothle (East of Mexico).
Once the goal of attracting 500 to 600 children is achieved, the study will continue at the Sports Centre of Independence (South Mexico) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (North of Mexico).
He explained that the purpose of this study was to understand the genetics and the importance of obesity development and to establish a risk factor for children and young Mexicans to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On 14 November, the World Day against Diabetes will be observed, and the main objective is to gather three thousand children and adolescents between 6 and 14 years of age with parents ' permission and under their supervision to complete individual food surveys.
They are also asked about physical activity and the history of family hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or an initial insufficiency.
He explained that anthropometric measurements of all participants (weight, growth and size), blood pressure and levels of glucose, fats, cholesterol and insulin, and genetic analysis (to identify genes associated with childhood obesity) would be carried out on Saturday.
Crus Lopez said that this study reflected the concern of health professionals about the alarming increase in weight among children.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 indicate that there has been an increase of only 6 years in age: 77 per cent for boys had an obesity, 47 per cent for girls; as far as weight is concerned, there has also been a significant increase," said MSSI specialist.
He said that the justification for finding markers was based on the fact that the population was different from other peoples in their genetic history.
He claimed that the average Mexican was 65 per cent of American Indians, 30 per cent of Europeans and five per cent of Africans, and that the condition was affected by the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that, mainly because of obesity, the body is unable to burn the excess of energy that we consume (calorie) and is depleted in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that a comprehensive assessment of children was a direct benefit for participants, which could determine whether they had any excess weight or weight.
In fact, he said that the presence of dark deposits on the neck (acants) and foreheads meant that metabolism and even prediabetes were likely to be disrupted.
The information is confidential, and the doctor will hand it over in writing to the parents, to whom they explain all the measurements and changes in the form of life that must be taken to avoid disease.
Crus Lopez explained that there were three main causes of excessive weight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a life-form sitting, or a lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day at home in front of the television and using transport at small distances instead of walking.
This is also due to high calorie consumption, i.e. increased use of sweet drinks and carbohydrates (tamale, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high level of fat and protein content and genetic predisposition as analysed in the programme.
UNAM asphalt can avoid friction
Rafael Errera, a study at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, developed a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of the best quality that is environmentally resistant and temperature-resistant.
If the signals sent by road cover were to be taken into consideration, about 200 thousand eggs would have to be repaired for each rainy season in the valley of Mexico City, said Rafael Errera Naher, a study at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, and added that if the construction and maintenance of an asphalt road cover is correct, the quantity of them could be reduced or even reduced to zero.
His lecture The Technology View of the Jama read in the International Year of Chemistry reported that the laboratory for which it is responsible was developing a polymer-modified bitumen for the production of a mixture with near-bitum characteristics, but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Errera Nahera said that this type of modified bitumen could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of roads and therefore to counter their education.
He explained that the bitumen, the hardest part of oil, is the sequence of hydrocarbons, some high molecular masses called asphalts, and others, low molecular masses called maltens, which together add to the road surface its characteristic binding behavior.
The second act of bitumen is that at high temperatures about 180 degrees it conducts itself as a liquid at 120 degrees high and at 50 degrees Celsius it maintains almost solid, while at very low temperatures the bitumen becomes fragile, he said.
This means that resistance to street asphalt is not permanent but changes during the day, depending on the natural conditions and temperature, the chemical engineer said.
The scholar Hymfaka noted that the streets of Mexico are mainly covered by a flexible cover consisting of six layers of material, three of which include bitumen.
Among the top layers is a bitumen made of small stones dropped in bitumen and then pressed.
Every stone that makes up that cover, he said it was loaded in a bit.
When moving vehicles and applying efforts, it helps the forces to make a very good distribution on the road surface.
If it were a modified asphalt, they would be even better distributed, the chemical engineer said.
On the surface of the asphalt, he added, the last layer, which is called the layer of exports made from a small stone, actually the sand also loaded into the asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will contact the wheels of transport, it must have more resistance than the asphalt cover and provide road train.
As part of the road cover, which will receive and distribute these efforts, the volume of exports also requires adequate thickness, and the material from which it is produced must be taken into account.
The weather, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are also very important factors for consideration, especially water, he said, because it has a significant impact on the state of the asphalt.
When the earth is raw, water penetrates into the surface and it is difficult to get out of it, it causes all layers of cover to spread and therefore food education.
When educating, he said that the first layer of exports was exposed and then only affected the bitumen, but the damage did not occur instantly, which should be given attention to the first signs of the current repair programmes.
Also, a member of the National Research System explained that transport load is another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each layer of cover should always be linked to transport load and it was necessary to ensure that this requirement was met to prevent frequent occurrence of them.
Rafael Errera said that about the bitumen, much still needs to be studied and done, for example, bitumen emulsions that are already on the market in other countries, even helping to make holes with ease and without high temperatures.
What's wrong with Vale's candidate to become a new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the causes that prevented Serna Melina Ramirez from getting her crown in Colombia.
Representative Vale received the Princess's title 14 times.
On a regular basis, Vale del Cauque just wanted to get a crown of Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramirez Serna was to be pleased that she had fallen to the stage of the winners with a silver crown and a chain announcing her new princess Colombia.
In view of the results achieved last night in Cartahan, where Miss Atlantica won the crown and the shield, the department has 14 titled princesses, and Melina joins the legion of the women from Vale del Couk who were close to the crown, but were announced by the princesses, among them Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Domingez (1949), Patricia Bellina Ajala (1979), Lauren Alvarez (1983), Rose Maria Alsate (1983), Olga Blance (1987), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Sonsuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Ichabel Romero (1993), Heise Alghre Gars (2000), Catalina Hirse (2007) and Hers.
The question that many now ask:
Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, which in each of the speeches showed that she had everything to become a new Miss Colombia, not just her being chosen by the Royal Police and the most beautiful person in the Vogue version, the titles that the Queens had, for example, Tatiana Vargas or Natalie Navarro, who received the crowns of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that has played a role in the jury's decision to condemn her to the title of the First Princess was that she was unable to give a convincing answer to the question, "What book characterizes you and why?
She answered the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of culture, and I certainly think that a book that characterizes my childhood -- "The Little Prince" -- is a pretty deep book.
Today, I am reading "Course and Punishment" as the head of the world literature that we should all read; I am also reading the book of Irina Nemirovska, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called "Breath of Blood."
The answer that the jury did not like because of the term “ocultation” and, secondly, because it did not explain specifically how each of the cited books describes it.
But after Melina's ceremony, she said she was calm and happy with her result: "The whole wisdom is what's going to happen."
And all of you, please, read a little bit, Little Prince, a great book.
Among the loud hypotheses – Vale was burned by favoritism.
The Bogotá reporter suggested that, because she was preferred to meet with ovations, she was a candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (Oster's culinary contest, the visual vote for the best national costume, and Queen Mother), “which aroused the zeal of other candidates, caused stress to the queen, and as a result she did not shine on the stage”.
And this was noted during her first appearance in the bathroom on Hilton Beach and during her two performances on evening coronation.
Although she seemed certain, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy that represented the Magdalena and the Atlantic.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Milena was named a princess "means that a candidate who wins more prizes during the contest does not become a queen"
In addition, representative Vale has recently avoided communication with the press, and that was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Vale failed to try to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Contest of Krasota.
That is why two days before the election of a member of the international jury Lucy Doti said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of her country.
"One beauty is not enough for Miss Colombia, we need to look not only outwardly, but also focus on public awareness before they participate in the competition, they need to be involved in projects," she said.
There is also the assumption that representative Vale had faulted with the defects in the beef and the fibrosis that had been seen in her life, but it was controversial, since the jury particularly noted her as a candidate with “natural beauty”, taking into account her healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
The King's Consultant, Jorge Ernan Orosko, notes that Melina had no better body than they had, "but the problems of the fibrosis on my life, which were not very noticeable to me, have caused her to lose her eyes the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Oyos of Crocos believes that the error of the representative of Vale-de-Cauca was that she was undergoing surgery.
"Operations are good, but representative Vale doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
With regard to the prize, which was first given by the organizers of the National Beauty Competition, the harsh prediction came last night, saying that it was the donor that Raymond gave Melin as compensation for her lack of pleasure in obtaining a crown.
Whether it is true or not, the fact that Melina today has a year of rule, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions directly mentioned by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, it will come to history as one of the kings who, despite his excellent speech at the Cartagena competition, faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
That was the work of a man who knew the body of Alfonso Cano.
A criminal from Kali has been in history as a man who confirmed Alfonso Cano's death.
The work of these servants is key.
On 4 November, CTI Kali entered history as a person who confirmed the identity of the head of FARC Alfonso Cano in comparison to his fingerprints.
Of the seven criminalists working at the CTI, this week, Elizar González, a man from Puerto Tehad who spent 21 years in the field of judicial investigation, was set up.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the cities of Choco, where he often had to spend more than five days in jungles to reach the places where bodies had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Vale and, after the completion of the relevant courses, became a specialist in criminalism, where he studied leather training, i.e. irons and stones.
On the Sunday of the Elishara operation, known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to wear no more than three days.
Something big was coming up.
On Friday night, he arrived at a helicopter from Cauca in Palmer.
He knew that he would have to identify two troops, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who led the world's oldest partisan war, so they asked him to take ten pictures of the fingerprints of Gilermo Leon Saens (his current name).
However, when he came from the research group to the location where the body was located, he did not recognize it in an outward form; he was very different from the one shown in the media.
He was without beards, dressed as a local farmer, without glasses, and much worse.
But prints aren't true.
Using an additional glass, a blacksmith, a shovel, and a plumber, Eliser compared the fingerprints of the body to those on the picture.
His eyes didn't tell me it was Alfonso Cano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerto Tehada asked to confirm to the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinson that he was the head of the RVSC
Find Fingerprints
The recognition of President Juan Manuel Santos Elizar González of President Sijin from Kali at the press conference on the operation against Cano is particularly significant.
Many people don't know what we're doing.
Dachtyloscopy is a strict science, without mistake, that it can play a key role in the discovery of crimes.
In addition to the identification of the bodies, dentists are involved in investigating crimes, such as theft and murder, and establish the identity of the detainees.
In detention, many criminals have false certificates or no documents.
We're taking their prints and looking for them in the base.
The researcher said that in the case of theft, he had to take a piece of the wall home, because in this place, the weather was holding hands to hold the safe, the full value, and the money.
"The walls are hard to work with, because they are not comfortable surfaces to remove prints, but in that case we can take pictures of the entire refrigerator and establish the identity of the criminal who took part in several thefts," he says.
The prints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in cases of murder.
A dead man had recently been found with bottles under the picture around him.
The investigation found that a family member could be suspected of committing a crime and that the fingerprints on the bottle actually coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was at the scene of the murder.
A specialist in dactyloscopes from CTI explained that there is a chemical or physical reagent in places where there are prints.
When they appear, a shovel or tape is used to remove them.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or entered in the register.
"The problem is that we still have many undocumented Colombians," said CTI expert.
He explained that it was not as shown in the CSI television programme.
Just as not all the gold that shines, not all that you touch leaves a mark on you.
However, if possible, a comparison will be made.
"Disgraceful People" pose a challenge to the New York authorities
Hundreds of Protestants broke up camp in front of Zukotti Square.
Some of the protestors heard the court's decision to disembark a demonstration from the scene and went to the neighborhood park.
The members of the Call for Wall Street movement called on the authorities of New York on Tuesday, when they tried to re-enter, under the protection of the court order, at Manhattan Square, where they were evacuated to the sky in an attempt to capture another Greater Apple Park.
Hundreds of protestors dug in Zukotti Square, where they wanted to fall through a court order that allowed "disgraceful people" to break camp in the square until the other part of the movement responded to the raid, capture the park in the north of the city, where further arrests were carried out
"Our idea is that once the court does not allow us to break up camp in the square, we will break up camp somewhere else and continue to fight for Zukotti's return and through peaceful sit-downs and demonstrations," said one of the representatives of the Wall Street movement, Mark Brey.
Bray explained that the response of "distorted people" to the evacuation of the palace town, which was ordered by the mayor of New York by Michael Bloomberg personally, was brought to court where Judge Lucy Billings issued a decree prohibiting forced evacuation from the camps and allowing the demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, the "disgraced people" began to capture a new park located on the site of the merger of the central streets of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the tunnel of the Netherlands, which unites New York and New Jersey, and which is owned by the Trinity Church.
At least one hour they were able to take this place, but then the police arrived and arrested some of the protestors, although Bree could not name the exact number, but told Efe that she had seen several journalists who were also in the handcuffs.
The organization assures that several hundred people stood in tents where the delegation of religious leaders had gone to demonstrate support for members of the movement, trying to act as mediator in negotiations with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zukotti area, which is a private property, remains closed pending the trial scheduled for this Tuesday, which will examine the legality of this morning ' s protest.
Some of the Protestants there carried and distributed copies of that court order at the same time and even gave those copies to the police guarding the area, which led to “some small clashes”, said Bree, who said that some police were demonstrators.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities from evacuation of members of the Wall Street Reserve movement and from forcing them to enforce “laws issued after the arrest, or from preventing demonstrators from regaining access to stores and other property used in the past”.
Ms. Bloomberg told reporters that the city had stopped opening public space and the demonstrators had been informed about it, but local laws did not allow them to re-launch tent stores and sleeping bags.
A member of the municipal council was personally justifying the removal of protests from Zukotti Square, which was carried out in the light of an operation involving approximately 200 arrests, and the decision was taken because the protests “infringed the law”.
Blomberg said he ordered the area to be cleared, as it became “a place where people were not to protest, but to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm others”, as “some businesses were threatened” and neighbors were afraid “for the deterioration of the quality of life”.
The evacuation carried out this morning was repulsive and shows that in the depths of Bloomberg's soul more interest in protecting the financial interests of American workers," the representative of the movement added, condemning the mayor for “infringement of freedom of speech”.
The leaders of the Wall Street Trust also indicated that they were planning to organize “great events” on Thursday, in collaboration with public organizations and trade unions, to remember the last two months of protests that began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will become Devo Maria in a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bubble and other Canadians, she will appear on the Rassel Peters' Christmas television program on 1 December.
Canada Pamela Anderson was an assistant to Tim Allen in "Bolsh Repair", rescuer at Malibu Rescuers, Banni in Playboy, wife of rock musician Tommy Li, and now the actress and model will become Devo Maria in a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
The private TV CTV announced today that Anderson, together with the crowner (executor of the ballad), Michael Bubble and other Canadians will appear on the Rassel Peters television program on 1 December, in the role of Mary in particular.
CTV presented a television show today, in which Anderson, also known for its wide-spread home porn video on the Internet, is still with his husband, the drummer of the Mötley Crüe group, Tommy Li, who is dressed as Dev Maria, who is holding a doll in front of Jesus.
In this scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comic of Indian origin, who recently appeared as the leader of the tour "My Cruel Torch of Truth" Charlie Shin, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peter, CTV is a Canadian singer, Bobble, who married in Buenos Aires at the Argentine model Louisiana Lopillato, and who also knows the crowd in the scandals.
Bubble recently called "suko" American Kim Cardassian at one of his concerts in New York
Japan, born after the earthquake
GDP increased by 1.5 per cent due to domestic consumption and put an end to the decline that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralysed and is still being cured of the devastating earthquake that has brought about the nuclear crisis, the most terrible catastrophe that the rising sun has brought about since World War II.
According to the Government of Tokyo, the material losses amounted to $300,000 — a blow that, despite the difficult world situation, seems to have passed.
After three loss-making quarters, data on the gross domestic product from July to September certainly helped to turn the page: GDP increased by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and by 6 per cent in the year.
Registered in the second quarter, the Japanese financial year begins in March 2012 and also highlights the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
Rebirth may be partly due to the repurchasing of machinery equipment for the restoration of areas devastated by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1 per cent against a reduction of 0.9 per cent of capital costs, which was observed from January to March, the first decrease after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real transition to the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Kenyan impulse, which calls for the crisis to be used to strengthen or restructure infrastructures, using lies to grow from scratch.
Japan woke up mainly because of household consumption, which now accounts for 60 per cent of Japanese GDP.
This rate increased by 1% by increasing the cost of cars, travel and rest.
Clémo yeen
Tokyo provided the internal market, when Yina, the Japanese currency, became one of the "refugee currency" selected by investors who want to escape the debt crisis in the euro area and negative US forecasts, a privilege that strikes as a stone on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, production is expensive abroad, which is a serious blow to a country whose economic rate is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Sonny, for example, blame the yen in their low rates from July to September.
While markets continue to sit in the EU's peripheral countries, the Esikhiko Noda Government is not losing its wake.
We must be careful about the remaining risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the sharp increase in the value of the yen, Minister of Economic Policy Motohis Furukawa said yesterday.
And in fact, prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most participating countries had demonstrated clear signs of a decline in economic activity in September.
The indicator, which predicts world economic disruptions, has shown that the main forces are slowing down.
It then fell to four tenths to 100.4 points compared with 100.8 in August.
The eurozone even fell below the average of 100 points after it had fallen to eight to 99.13 points.
Aphines Reproduce Suspects
Papadimos said that the adjustment would be approved, but the preservatives would not sign any written obligation
With the periphery of risk and uncertainty in the parks, Greece continues to wander around the maze, leading to a major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consent" of the new transitional government of Ellad is being imposed on Brussels rather than on the true conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos warned yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that a hundred-day period agreed upon when he was appointed might be insufficient for their application, the conservative leader of the New Democracy Party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support new measures of strict economy in any case and would repeat his claim for the new elections appointed on 19 February.
The main objective of the Government is to implement the decisions taken at the 26 October summit, Papadimos said yesterday, opening parliamentary debates, which will be given tomorrow ' s vote of confidence in the new executive authority.
The package of 24 programmes for increased employment, reform of the disciplinary code of public servants and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first introduction.
However, the Samaras message does not express any doubt about his position: "We are ready to help the Transitional Government, but we promise nothing."
The Conservative leader did more than one step in his attitude towards the EU and IMF, organizations that were to freeze 8,000 million people urgently needed for Athens, and explained that he would not grant his approval to any letter of agreement with the requirements of the treaty.
However, the European Commission, while still trying to resist the effect of the Papandreou referendum's allegations in a whole or nothing, reiterated yesterday that its demands are unanimous: it will not renew aid if the new Government and leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written agreement without any ambiguity and as soon as possible".
The representative of the Ministry of Economic Affairs Amadeu Altafay said that the three inspectors could return to Athens soon to discuss with the new Government “what should be done to pay the sixth instalment” of 8,000 million, although the exact date has not yet been indicated.
In the Greek club, nets will be enough for a while.
Ms. Sofia: "These are tools of progress and hope"
The Queen emphasized the "basic" place of Spain in respect of this type of finance
Spain “has taken a prominent position in the world in the field of microfinance”.
The Queen of Sofia recalled yesterday that in the last two decades, the country has become a second donor in terms of the instruments of cooperation, whose “resistance”, she said, is “a tool for social progress, justice and hope for the best future of all humanity based on faith in humans”.
Yesterday, the Queen opened the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valyadolid with the conviction that “there is no doubt” that such actions are “very necessary” to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015, and that “with a particular aim of reducing the double number of people living less than one dollar a day, the level at which the poverty line is recorded.”
Spain "is still working" to expand the network of beneficiaries worldwide and to take on this task with full "responsibility", says Ms. Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements that will take place at the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will "provide new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest people and especially for women, "the main recipients of these loans".
There are "many achievements" and "many difficulties we face."
The Microcredit Summit is not only a platform for disputes, but also a platform that promotes “two main objectives”.
Her Majesty thus explained that she hoped that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would benefit from these financial services and hundreds of millions of households would be selected from the poverty in which they were displaced.
The impetus for the establishment of a microcredit system in Spain and throughout the rest of the world “walked on the road that began years ago” by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Ms. Sofia as “a act of justice and recognition”.
And she described the father of this instrument as a "favorable idealist in the general fight against poverty", whose work has been known for 15 years since the Queen went to Bangladesh to study his lending policy.
This year, the first World Summit was held in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and “I have seen continuous development everywhere”, said Her Majesty, whose relationship with the project brought her the title “head of the family”, which was collected in Valyadolide as “poor banker”.
Finally, the Queen of Sofia concluded her statement by calling on those present to participate in the discussion and finding solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Foreign Minister Trinidad Hymenez said that solidarity was an “ethical imperative” for each democratic State.
In this regard, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries with the times of the economic paper, since it was a “permanent commitment”.
Hymenes concluded that microcredit implies a “serious and solid course aimed at eradicating poverty”, and now “greater than ever” the Governments of developed countries must work according to the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to be a victim of a reduction in costs.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of development cooperation”.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Sarajevo Rodriguez, praised the “success” to give “confidential” to those “closed to whom all doors are closed”, and Mayor Valyadolid Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva welcomed all those present in the city who “opens their doors covered by the spirit of solidarity”.
HDS proposes to elect the President of the European Commission by a general vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (HDS) in Leipzig on Monday, 14 November, passed without any major problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was also chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but it was only in the autumn, in particular to satisfy activists who felt that the government's policy was not as strict as it should be today with Greece and perhaps with Italy tomorrow....
The draft resolution on the Presidency in the European Commission, which was discussed by the Management Board, was almost unanimously adopted.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained from the vote.
The ovations, which continued for several minutes, earned their statements by Angela Merkel and several hours later by Wolfgang Shoible, the Eurofill and the Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the chancellor and the draft resolution is the lie: the right answer to the crisis is “not less Europe, but more Europe”.
Not just because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
For the chancellor, the time has come for a break-in in Europe.
This may mean changes in the Lisbon Treaty, which make it possible to strengthen the European Union's control of the eurozone's financial policies, but it may also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by a general vote, "to give Europe a person".
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by the Congress, which obviously belongs to Wolfgang Shoible.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will agree quickly with this decision; Britain is against it, and HDS leaders believe that Nikola Sarkozi is against it too.
But the soil's ready.
Similarly, the overwhelming majority of delegates rejected the proposal to weigh the votes of each member of the European Union in the European Central Bank in accordance with the size of each economy, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
The chancellor has increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kolya, but it has not sought to influence the congress by means of "small" European countries or countries in a difficult situation that like to criticise "highly" Germany.
Although the whole paragraph of the draft resolution on Europe is devoted to the importance of the German-French friendship, Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Just by the way.
Remember that two centuries ago, Leipzig became the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonian army.
What's the lie with the hospital letters?
As a result of the cash benefits, the UMP and the Government began to enter hospitals.
On 15 November, Nikola Sarkozy will come to Bordo to visit the family benefit fund and to address the issue, which has been periodically raised since 2007, about combating social benefits fraud.
In order to help this phenomenon, which arose from the desire to save it in a difficult situation, but also from a part of the campaign of the right to re-election in the Presidents, most would like to focus on hospitals.
First of all, with regard to the budget economy, the Government intends to impose on private company employees the fourth day of unpaid leave before the payment of the benefit.
Apparently, without the employer's special consent, the employee loses pay for four days, at least 15 per cent of his/her monthly income.
A measure that threatens to produce a storm of anger, but which, according to Les Echos, will save 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely to impose one day's sickness benefit on public employees without paying the sickness allowance (the public servants have not yet had to wait for benefits, unlike the three-day expectations of private sector workers).
Now that these issues are discussed, most of them also raise the subject of fraud again, with regard to ill-use in the issuance of hospital letters.
Control will become more expensive and additional, if you are caught, you will have to return all the illegal payments you received," Ksawy Bertran warned on the RTL channel on Saturday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effect of the statement has been disproportionate to the actual abuse of hospitals.
They have indeed been under constant control and political attacks since 2002.
People in France suffer no more than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's first look at the numbers on the side.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million Euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation of the Health Economy, daily compensation costs in 2008 amounted to 11.3 million euros, 5 per cent of total health costs.
Of this amount, 46 per cent were for statutory leave and accidents in production and 54 per cent for sickness benefits, which amounted to 6.2 thousand euros.
Consequently, 2.5 per cent of health-related expenditures were incurred.
The French conducted an average of 14.5 days in 2010 compared with 17.8 days in 2009, according to the Alma Consulting Group study.
The average arithmetic that conceals some deviations; another study published in 2007 by Monster.com's career management site showed that 75 per cent of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not taken a hospital one day.
Another study on health insurance claims that in 2010, 37 per cent of the patients were less than 8 days long, 15 per cent of 15 days a month, 15 per cent of one to three months long and 11 per cent longer.
When comparing these figures with the figures of European neighbours, it is clear that French workers are no longer likely to be hospitalized than those of any other country.
The long-term study conducted by two CNRS researchers in 2010 showed that between 1994 and 2001, the total lack of work in France (for health reasons or not) fluctuated between 10 and 11 per cent, compared with 20 to 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16 to 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The level of fraud associated with hospital letters is very low compared to "serious" employment.
With regard to the level of fraud, he's very low.
Aggravation of the law after 2002 resulted in a systematic check of hospital duration for more than 45 days.
In 2008, of the 1.5 million cases reviewed by CNAM, 13 per cent of the 285,000 short-term findings were “unjusted” or too long”, representing 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked hospital letters over 45 days, 11 per cent of 1.2 million cases were “inappropriate or unfounded”, as well as 132 000 cases.
Overall, 169,000 cases were “unfounded” by several million workers receiving hospital letters.
The figures that show very few cases, for example, with the number "serious" of employment.
According to UMP Dominika Tian, the author of the report on this issue in June, they account for between €9 million and €15 billion of unaccompanied budget revenue per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore infinitely higher than the loss of fraud.
Padatimos: Greece must follow the new plan for settlement
Greece needs a new solution programme to save its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos said in Parliament, adding that 100 days provided to his coalition Government were insufficient to carry out this task.
"In order to achieve the objectives of saving the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Government's head, who made his first public statement, opening a debate on the voice of confidence in Parliament on the environment.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October should be the “main task” of the new Government, since the country ' s presence in the Eurozone is “imposed” - he added.
Accordingly, Papadimos predicts a reduction in the country ' s budget deficit of approximately 9 per cent from GDP by the end of the year, with 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
Rights reject new Government measures
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support further measures of a strict economy.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with Members from his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the challenges of reducing the deficit and debt and combating corruption, but also his rejection of any course that impeded the recovery of the economy.
Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner responsible for the economy and finance, who warned that IMF and the EU would not block the necessary loan of €8,000 million without written guarantees from all parties, that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legitimize euthanasia and suicide with foreign assistance, the Committee of Experts states
Canadians refuse to die, as confirmed in the report of the Royal Society of Canada
With regard to palliative medicine, the Committee argues that the Government, the health institutions and the doctor are working together to ensure the best palliative care, without regard to cancer.
Canadians refuse to die.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in this direction.
This is one of the conclusions of the impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts from different areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the Penal Code in such a way as to permit suicide with foreign aid and euthanasia when the choice is imposed under circumstances and the patient can be considered competent to take such a decision.
To begin with, the experts refer to a recent study of the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the world.
While Canada is in 10 places, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid of arguing about death”.
Because of medicalization or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative assistance, experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada report.
And 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
The highest rate in Quebec, where 86 per cent of deaths occur in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and suicide, the authors of the report come to a conclusion that contradicts the position of the federal government, which has already stated that they do not want to change anything in the criminal code on euthanasia and suicide with foreign aid.
Now, according to experts who have also examined the position of all countries where such actions have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization has an impact on abuse, i.e. the use of euthanasia or suicide with foreign aid to persons who cannot or do not wish to make such a decision.
On the contrary, he confirmed during the Jocelin Downi teleconference, which presented the report, most of which were in countries where euthanasia and suicide by foreign aid were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is obviously illegal.
Suicide with foreign aid is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, explains Joselle Downi.
Canadian euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85 per cent of Canadians advocate euthanasia because, according to Angus Reida's 2010 survey, they believe that this will allow people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66 per cent believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not signal that the life of older persons or persons with disabilities is less valuable.
With regard to people who assisted in suicide, 41 per cent of the respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care for the patient, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
They also propose, in addition to their other recommendations, that the Penal Code should provide that legal termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals be trained in a spirit of respect for the rejection of medical care at the end of life without fear of criminal persecution.
With regard to palliative assistance, the Committee calls on the Government, health care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative assistance, not only in cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to the palliative or terminal session already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requires that it be applied when it does not serve to alleviate physical pain, such as euthanasia, and is subject to the same restrictions.
Comments from other experts
Some health-related legislation experts have already commented on the conclusion of the report of the Royal Society of Canada.
Metr Pierre Deshan, a health law specialist, described as an "end of the" position of experts who signed the report, because, among other things, it does not restrict the use of euthanasia in mortal cases.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of living and who is over 18 years old can ask for help in committing suicide, says Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Metr Dasham also stressed that the authors of the report seem to place personality independence above all other values that form the social fabric of society.
He said, "There are warning signs and prohibitions in society."
Health Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expresses “a categorical disagreement with the conclusions of the report, which she called “the euthanasia manifest.”
Margaret Somerville, himself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, contests, inter alia, the report on abuses in some countries where euthanasia and suicide with foreign aid are legalized as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to give up power
Damascus Condemns "Condemnation"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partners of Bashar Assad held a demonstration yesterday before the Foreign Ministry building.
Yesterday, the diplomatic pressure on Syria was intensified by Bashar Asada, who, with the support of Russia, opposed him and condemned the “convention” against his country.
Two days later, following the suspension of Syrian membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union intensified its sanctions against Damascus, and the neighbours of Syria and Turkey and Jordan resigned from President Assad.
The king of Jordan, Abdullah II, became the first Arab leader yesterday, who summoned President Bashar Assad to power in Syria, where about forty civilians and military personnel were killed.
"If Bashar had been in the interests of his country, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life," said the King of Jordan, a neighbor to Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
In turn, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that Turkey's mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, had not been successful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy their aspirations lose power, he said, looking for Syria, the neighbouring country to which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh course.
For their part, the United States welcomes the “enlargement of consensus against Assad and the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and such countries as Turkey, are taking an ever-increasing course towards repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a representative of the State Department.
At that time, 16 civilians and at least 19 armed forces were killed in the area of Derwa in southern Syria, reports the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other residents were killed during the shooting and shooting of heavy bullets in Jobara in the occupied town of Homs, according to the NGO.
During the press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Valid Muallem said the country was approaching the end of the crisis."
He also reacted strongly to the decision of the League of Arab States to delete Damascus, which he said was a “dangerous step”.
Syria will not be broken, he added, believing that the treaty against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to delete Syria, the League of Arab States is currently studying “the civil protection mechanism and requires the recruitment of 500 members of the Arab Human Rights Organization, journalists and military observers in the country.
The French Foreign Minister, Alan Zuppe, also spoke of the dispatch of UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he said had fallen into “paranoia”.
The new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabata to discuss the implementation of the exit plan, adopted on 2 November, which includes, inter alia, the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities where the fighting is taking place and the release of the arrested demonstrators.
Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called yesterday a "incorrect" decision by the League of Arab States, while China called on Syria to implement a plan to escape the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty requires time in Italian markets and victims
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for a short time to form their own command and to implement a programme that would require "victims" to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of the Berlin government.
The former European Commissioner yesterday participated in discussions with political parties before today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
It will have to form a relatively moderate office made up of technocrats who are not members of Parliament.
Monty spoke about the importance of the programme, which was one of the many victims, said Francesco Nucara, a representative of a number of small parliamentary groups that took part in the discussions following a meeting with a candidate for the Prime Minister.
Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Janfranko Finini, said he would wait to see if Mario Monty would ask Parliament to vote for confidence by Friday to ensure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The meeting ended with Mr. Monty's presentation of a limited list of dozens or around that of ministers, the head of the country, Georgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented yesterday on the nervousness of the stock exchanges and bond holders, requesting time.
In “democracy takes time to prepare the Government and programme, he stressed, adding that he was convinced that markets would be patient and understanding”.
His appointment by the President was initially approved by the markets, but concern arose again, particularly after the unexpected fall of industrial production in the Eurozone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister was to form a team, including, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include “politics”.
The new Government will have to act by 2013, the dates of the next elections, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Janfranko Finini, the new Government will receive Parliament's confidence on Friday.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that once he entered the post, he would work hard to ensure that Italy would again become an important active person in Europe.
The representative of European Commissioner Ollie Rehn stressed that “in spite of the new Government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed”.
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not implement the 2013 budget, despite the strict economy that has been taking place in recent months, has required, in particular, new strict measures.
The Italian boss Emma Marchegali, who met with him on Tuesday, also insisted that the economy should be relaunched, “because a country that has no growth cannot meet the deficit.”
Mr. Monty, known for his competence and independence in the home of the European Commissioner (1994-2004), represented the “change of era” for Italy after 17 years of “berlusconism”, “professor”, symbolizing “resistance challenges” and “other Italy”, according to the authors of the exhibitors.
The longevity of his team is unknown.
The President of Naples would be pleased to avoid early elections, as by April 2012, Italy should pay public debt payments of 200 thousand euros.
Russian scholar helped the Iranian nuclear programme
Russian scholar Wiacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, a US nuclear-hazarded agency confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of the UN Agency to establish the identity of the scientist.
Last week, IAEA expressed concern about the "possible military aspect" of the Iranian nuclear programme
According to ISIS, based largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, worked for 30 years, “beginning in the sixties, at the Soviet nuclear centre in Chelabinska (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds of explosive methods”.
In 1989 or 1991, he left the center to create a company producing nanoalmases in Kiev.
His company's financial difficulties led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002 until his return to Russia.
In its report, IAEA mentions “clear evidence that the development of Iran’s nuclear detonator system “has equipped a foreign expert who not only knew this technique well but also informed the Agency that he had worked most of his career in this technology under his country’s military nuclear programme”.
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50 per cent
According to the FBI statistics published on Monday from 2009 to 2010, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 per cent, while other forms of racial and religious violence declined slightly or did not change during the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, which is equal to 49 per cent, compared to an increase of 13 per cent in Catholic violence, a decrease of 4 per cent in Jews attacks and a total increase of 14 per cent in religious crimes.
The total number of hate crimes reported by the FBI has increased significantly to 6,628 cases, 47.3 per cent of which were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent by religious differences.
After a decrease in 2009, there is concern that the number of these crimes is growing again, emphasizes the human rights organization Human Rights First, “an increase in violence against Muslims,” adds the organization in the official communication.
“Human Rights First has long stressed that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be regarded as serious violations of human rights”, added one of the leaders of Paul Legandr.
"The American Government can and must do more to deal with these crimes, adding that this can be done by improving police reports on hate crimes."
"Hate crimes" in federal law is the legacy of the period of civil rights struggle.
This law was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence involving race, colour, religion, nationality and sexual orientation in our days.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes similar to Facebook
On Monday, Twitter's microblog site changed its platform to allow users, in particular, to see the activity of those whom they watch as making this service similar to Facebook.
The new "activities" and other "names" tab allow you to monitor more easily and directly the activities of other "twitters", users whose messages ("tweets") you follow, and those who follow yours.
This provides an opportunity to know if they publish messages, if they are subscribed to new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was protested "by a small percentage of users in August" before going out on a wide-ranging network on Monday, AFP told Twitter press secretary Caroline Penner.
Twitter, which has been known for a long time as intuitively vague and using rather vague terms (RT for the displacement of someone else's message, #followfriday for the recommendation to track other users), is largely gratifying to experienced users, thus opening up to a wider audience, representing users something closer to popular social networks Facebook and Google+.
In the web, users have discussed this innovation through tweets on the Internet.
"It's useless, forceful, and crossword puzzle Facebook."
Functional activity will help me to better monitor certain elements of my stream on Twitter, wrote @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction to the Golden Rule Constitution
The leadership of the large coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to write the budget "gold" into the Constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid possible reductions by the public credit rating agencies of Austria (Third A).
The Chancellor of Social Democrats Werner Faymann personally announced the decision at the end of the ministerial meeting, while the Austrian State debt was 74.6 per cent higher than the upper threshold of 60 per cent established by the Maastricht Treaty but below the State debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's ability to pay fell to just one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an interest of three thousand million euros per year, the vice-canceller's argument and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Christian Democrats Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus complies with the demand of the Eurozone Summit on 26 October in Brussels; Heads of State and Government requested a reduction in budgetary deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced public accounts through a constitution or equivalent law.
The order adopted by the Austrian Government recalls the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt this "rule".
By 2017, the State budget deficit should be reduced annually by 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and, since 2017, the State budget deficit of the federal State should not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP per year, and the land, like the municipalities, should represent balanced budgets.
The aim is to impose a State debt below the 60 per cent mark of the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Eshiiko Noda
Threatened by a new intervention in the currency market
Japanese Prime Minister Esihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would take new intervention in the currency market if the value of the yena continued to grow.
We intervene, as we did last time, when we consider the excessive volatility of the exchange rate of the yen, Mr. Noda Senate explained.
On Tuesday, the yen grew almost until the historic note that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars to a large extent to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which has established a new record of power since 1945.
But since then, there has been a growing trend, driven by the purchases of investors who view it as a "refuge" in these sad times of economic downturns around the world and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbol board in 105 yen, close to the level that led to the last intervention.
Prior to the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar was about 120 yen and the euro was over 160 yen.
The growth of the Japanese currency damages Japanese exports because it makes Japanese products cheaper and reduces the income of Japanese firms because of foreign exchange conversions.
“Japan fights to recover” after the earthquake and tsunamis on 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), stressed Mr. Noda, who feared that this growth would kill a fragile recovery.
Third in the world, the economic Power resumed growth in the third quarter -1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, due to the growth of exports and consumption of disaster-affected households
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price of yen does not reflect the “fundamental economic indicators of Japan”.
Minister of Finance June Adzumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Board on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But the Deputy Managing Director of Hirohide Yamaguti warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken “the appropriate steps” to understand that no further mitigation in the environment should be expected.
At the last meeting, at the end of October, the issuing organization increased the purchase of cash bonds by 5,000 million euros (47 thousand euros) by up to 55,000 million euros (519 thousand euros) in the amount it allocates to purchase various financial instruments to fill the market in securities.
Eurozone
rates increase, stock exchanges fluctuate
The risk of a debt crisis undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of State in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in unstable countries continue to grow
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, the European stock exchanges went into the negative zone on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent and ended trading at 3,064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell by 0.4% and London by 0.1%.
Because of the new difficulties in lending to eurozone countries in difficulty, global fund markets continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
"The worried investors are simply too concerned about the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, the institutional broker IG Markets quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a drop of 0.7 per cent under the burden of new market doubts about Europe's ability to hold a debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has sought its views on Europe, and the stock exchange will follow each other in the corridor of strong changes until investors have confirmed that the situation has stabilized," says Michucigue Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management
This return of concern over the future eurozone is a single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has reached its lowest mark in half a month.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was $1.3570, down by 0.4 per cent.
According to the brokers, it fell after the arrival of Chancellor Angela Merkel HDS on Monday, which adopted a resolution providing, inter alia, the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro without leaving the European Union together.
Italian and Spanish rates were significantly higher than 6 per cent
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at a very high level.
This morning, on Tuesday, the income of the Italian 10-year-old bond reached 6.85 per cent and the income of the Spanish bond reached 6.2 per cent with the same maturity.
This complexity with interest rates in southern countries, but also in France, continues to undermine the fears of participants.
The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, asked for time in exchange to restore the situation in Italy under the paralysis of its debt.
The new Prime Minister of Greece, Lucas Papadimos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be the “main task” of his Government.
Spain was under attack before the parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The rate of 10-year debt ratio between Germany and Spain has reached a new historical peak.
Expecting growth in the eurozone
France recorded an economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, slightly better than expected of 0.3 per cent, thanks to increased household consumption.
Insee, however, revised to reduce the number of the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
Economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded an increase of 0.5 per cent over the same period.
The first euro area assessment is expected at 11 a.m., and the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is a topic on which a decision cannot be taken after a continuous discussion or under the influence of emotions, it is an energy policy.
The availability and value of electricity directly affect the purchasing capacity and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that electoral meetings are a reason for thinking about the share and location of nuclear energy.
The struggle will not produce results until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options are explored.
France must draw its opinion on objective facts and on rational data.
Now that we are 7 thousand people on the planet, demographic development will result in a double demand for electricity by 2050, unless the vast majority of the world ' s population is left with vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to meet the growing shortage of fossil resources in order to continue the production of electricity on a continuous basis, bearing in mind the essential need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate imbalances, a theme that has disappeared from environmental debates.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains single in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which makes its decision depending on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil are just a few of those who are firmly continuing their projects.
The United States decided to add one plant to its set after the Fukushima, re-establishing the station that was interrupted after the Tri-Mail Island accident.
Although the German model, based on renewable energy, is sometimes cited as an example, the reality is contrary to that argument.
Berlin's choice would result in an increase in the value of electricity, an increase in energy dependence, reinforced by the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, to increase the greenhouse gas emissions from the construction of gas and coal stations.
Within a few months, all these adverse effects will be felt.
Denmark’s example should be considered.
Europe's Turbine Construction Championship, from which it receives 30% of its electricity, is also the largest carbon and gas user due to the wind breaks; hence carbon dioxide and electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than on average in Europe.
On the other hand, because of the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40% more than the French households.
Since the globalised energy price is a key factor in competitiveness and the maintenance of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear energy will result in a significant increase in the value of electricity, which will make illustrative beautiful statements about the new industrialization of our country and the protection of purchasing power.
The price that most French people refuse to pay is because they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the country ' s energy policy has made it possible to create the industry in 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 seconded.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts a whole plaza of international trade of small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another sector.
If France decided to refuse nuclear energy, it would have to sacrifice a large number of these enterprises and lose €6,000 per year from French nuclear equipment and services exports.
What electric engineer will order EPR to work for 60 years if the closure of its manufacturer is planned?
In order to solve the equation of energy, it should be recognized that there are no divine or Devilic sources of energy production.
The development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions by Areva demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
Supporting the highest level of security for nuclear energy is undoubtedly a vital issue
In France, we have a security body that conducts uncompromised and transparent monitoring of existing energy centres, such as Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is generally recognized, are filled with the same security.
For 50 years, the nuclear industry has survived three major incidents.
Only one, Tri-mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any human or environmental consequences
In Chernobyl, the reactor device and the unprovoked human error led to a tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that an accident occurred as a result of two natural disasters of unprecedented force that led to the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn lessons from this incident, as learned from the previous two.
The result of this step and the cooperation between security authorities, operators and French and German constructors, EPR, is a project to counter such phenomena.
Since it is considered by all energy professionals wishing to build a reactor, the halting of its construction in Flamanville will be a great gift to the competitors Areva and EDF, clearing them of the way to win the leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear energy.
It is necessary and lawful to seek the best combination of energy for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and biases to be raised in a dispute that is so important to our country ' s economic, social and financial situation.
Immigration - a burden or good for the economy?
Immigration policy with Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised by various parties - the overloading of police, judicial and administrative services, subject to digit policy and the compatibility of this policy with France's self-declared status as “human rights” states.
Then there was the administrative concern of foreign students, which was released when the Minister of the Interior (Liberason of 23 May) said that France “does not need foreign talents, stones and officers”.
But it is very rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The right and the left agree in a lot.
On the right hand side, Jacques Shirak, who said in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people will not be the problem in the country with 2 million foreign workers", and on the left, Michel Rokar, who explained in 1990, that France “cannot accept poor people from all over the world”.
Differences in Gift Only
In 2005, fear of invasion of the country was felt both by the left and by the right.
Both sides see the burden of immigration for the French economy and for the French society.
The difference is only at the level of generosity that they allow for immigrants to show.
In his program, François Holland was limited by the banality, he said that "co-operation will enable us to solve our immigration problem."
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem can give an electric advantage, but it is very expensive economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us in a recent book, which summarizes the latest data on immigration (Special People: How Migration has formed our world and will determine our future, May 2011, Princeton University, 352 C.), there is a broad consensus among professionals on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
The restriction of immigration has led to a decrease in growth and employment.
Fears of the influence of immigrants are based on the assumption that they are able to replace local workers, especially low-skilled, by causing a reduction in wages.
However, experience shows that in reality immigrants are far more complementary than they are replacing local labour by doing work for which local labour is not sufficient.
Unqualified immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training is not related to job proposals.
Positive impact on salaries
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complementarity between local and immigrants has led to a positive impact on the wages of local workers.
Juanni Peri calculated that the increase of 1% of the migration flows led to an increase of 0.6-0.9% of real long-term wages.
And this is without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (a large proportion of the Nobel Prize's winners, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo, were all based on immigrants).
Migrants also benefit from the social security system, with an average of 1 per cent of the total budgets of European countries.
According to the World Labour Organization, for example, an immigrant in Germany, when he was 30 years old, would earn a public budget of EUR 150,000 on average.
In the beginning of his mandate, Nikola Sarkozy was about to fall into a lack of growth.
The said teeth that used to scare immigrants had an even opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to think European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; it is also fragile.
The European continent must remember that, when it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, it survived the tragedy of World War I, totalitarian regimes, Holocaust, Gulag, and Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and Colonels in Greece.
Some felt that if democracy was to be overpowered by its enemies, it would be enough to put a vote and make it as direct as possible.
From the time of Napoleon Malgo, it is known that this is due to the surface of the mind.
The general vote, although a mandatory condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can even become a "pressive tool", as one philosopher-Republican Etienne Yourro said.
No, democracy also requires a lot of other public space, public spirit, values, organization, division and control of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but primarily it is a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the true-false Greek referendum would have a double-declaration effect, demonstrating both the need for serious policy change and the uncomfortable sense of its impossibility and inconsistency.
This duality must be thought to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the fight for democracy has now moved and many believe that the Republican soldiers are now not on that side.
We do not win anything by requiring a series of national referendums organized as necessary and in a chaotic manner.
"Cart-Blanch" for an absolute European monarch, or a leg-to-feet to break nationalism - what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not dream of the lesion of the guillotine, but of the implementation - joint, clear and continuous - of election and democracy, at this time at the European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and how many more will have to be listed because there is only one crisis - the crisis of Europe.
All over Europe is subject to the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, suffering from their weakness and lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is completely humiliated on the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of the sovereignty of Europe, but all of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each nation.
A European project under popular sovereignty needs to be restored urgently.
Because only by working together, Europeans can reduce everyone's debt, get rid of the markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
The outcome of the crisis will require decisions at the European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy without bringing us to disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal, the Socialists and Jacques Delor are still demanding the European Economic Government.
Let it go.
But to represent it without a stronger economic, political and democratic integration that has come into existence is a common folly and a new stupidity.
We must start a new phase of European construction.
In order to establish a republic in France, it was necessary to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of interest would not be sufficient.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a united Europe at the economic level.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, the people of Europe.
To create Europe, let us create Europeans.
The wireless chip cards are being distributed more and more widely.
The World Chip Card show opens on Tuesday in Wilpente, Paris, in an atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 2011 will result in an 11 per cent increase in world microprocessors sales (bank cards, SIM cards phones), with more than 6 million Eurosmart figures.
The most important non-contact technology sector that allows public transport or purchase to be paid simply by carrying out a map over the reader ' s device.
This year, 460 million non-contact chips will be sold worldwide against 320 million years ago!
Their share will rise in 2012 (regarding 580 million units) and will account for almost 10% of the world market for chips (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has been leaving the Asia-Pacific region for a long time, is now moving forward in the field of wireless payments.
About 26 million Visa bank cards have already been provided for this function, and they are accepted by 75,000 terminals.
France is starting from a more modest position: there are 400,000 visa-free cards.
But big stores are growing fast.
Carrefour released 2.5 million homeless Pass MasterCard this year.
To get to a higher speed, banks need to provide their customers with equipment.
"Two major organizations in France have promised to systematically distribute to their clients the bank cards that are suitable for wireless use in the future," said Gera Nebui, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing payments using a mobile phone.
But it's just the first stage of the development of the future payment facility, that's the mobile phone.
Only a few devices are equipped with the NFC technology (NFC) needed for such transactions.
"They were postponed.
"But they must actually fly next year."
"We are counting on world sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012," explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced that the experiment would be conducted from December to June next year in Cana.
The iPhone equipment will provide approximately 200 customers and staff with check-ins that provide wireless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also said yesterday that he was preparing to launch a proposal to allow customers to pay through mobile phones.
The terrorist front is spread from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-standing links between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that Algerians were now convinced of this.
“The way these two organizations use and the reports of secret services show that they are actively cooperating,” he explained, not in detail.
Paris seems to have come to similar conclusions.
A survey of the abduction of two French people in Niger in January revealed two binding calls.
The people who were abducted at the restaurant in Niamea, near Aqmi, Antuan de Leokur and Vensan Delori, were apparently killed the following day along with several of the kidnappers during the operation by the French special units.
Among the envelopes left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators have found several telephone maps belonging to terrorists.
Here's the terror.
A number of interviewees in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria were identified by the analysis of telephone calls.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one refers to a Nigerian who lives long in Majdiguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the Boko Haram kalebeli, and the other to a man as claimed, close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This step forward, but there is no doubt more reliable evidence to be expected before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But that's possible."
“It has been known for many years that the sect has received financial and ideal support outside and that it is becoming increasingly active,” says Kunle Amuvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident by the actions and statements of Boco Haram and its methods, which now include the use of mortals and the increasingly complex explosive devices of the same type as Aqmi.
The international community in head with Washington is now putting pressure on Abuja to focus on the problems that Boko Haram poses.
The case is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally viewed this group as a community of educated people who are not interested.
Quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maidiguri, at the mosque, at the school, and at the hands of the fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuffe, Boko Haram, which means “Western education is a sin” - the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has made rapid progress.
It has been politicized and requires strict compliance with the Shariya, and its activists have begun to fight against the dishonest central government.
It is mainly aimed at the churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Activists Boco Haram showed special activity by committing numerous attacks on police offices.
Abuji's reaction is usually uncompromised.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead.
Mohammed Joseph, taken alive, was killed in prison.
The sect now radicalizes and goes beyond its northern voodoos.
Last Christmas she took responsibility for the action, which resulted in the killing of 80 people in Jose and then another in Abuja.
In June, in Abuja Boko Haram, the first attack of the death victim was organized at a strengthened police headquarters.
In August, the local representation of the United Nations will be their first international goal.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, concerns all security experts at present.
Today, when Aqmi was strengthened in Mali and Niger and the Somalis from al-Shabaab are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with Presidents, Gudlak Jonathan Allen Zuppe warned about the danger of Boko Haram and expressed his willingness to share all the information available.
Peace, as the Republican candidates see in the presidents
With regard to China, Iran and Israel's assistance, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane and Rick Perry are struggling with simplification and incompetence.
Could a weakened America crisis lead to a complex world through simple, more precise, simplistic ideas?
If candidates were to be heard by the presidents of the Republic, voters could believe that.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying a number of large but remote details of foreign policy declarations that are traditionally a strong side of the Republic.
Lies concerning China, Iran and Israel ' s assistance are often mixed with one another.
Mitt Romney, who had the best chance of moving from the Old Good Party, threatened to file a complaint to the Chinese in the WTO and accuse them of "manipulation of their currency" -- a sensitive topic for the Americas concerned with the migration of their entire industry to Asia.
It's worse if it leads to a trade war," he said.
John Huntsman, former Ambassador Obama to China, and the only candidate who understands a difficult foreign policy, was unable to overcome a position that was intimidating.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (now Obama's position).
But Huntsman, who's holding in the bottom of the ratings, remained unheard of.
Reagan-style
Romania also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions could not stop its nuclear programme.
"If they choose me, I'll stop Iran," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to strengthen Israel's military assistance, accusing Obama of not complying with the commitments made to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Kane, the second candidate in the ranking, demonstrated a depressing ignorance of cases.
He recently called for a Chinese military threat because Beijing has been trying to achieve nuclear power, obviously not knowing that China has had it since 1964!
Governor Texas Rick Perry, who is supporting Israel and seeking military strikes on Iran, said he was ready to use the American army in Mexico against drug addicts.
By resorting to the torture of suspects in terrorism, prohibited by Obama in 2009, they also recommend Cain, Perry and the candidate Michel Bachman.
This is very far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McKain, who is a serious foreign policy.
The opponents of the current President are responsible for the fact that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won a cold war.
They remind us that Obama himself was a lover and that he had to lower his tone in combating terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, at the early conclusion of the "people" from Iraq, his captures in Libya, which led to his reputation as a weak policy.
But it's not that simple.
The population considered the positive balance of national security in Obama, which eliminated Ben Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military intervention that binds in sand.
And by claiming that America needs to be restructured economically to restore its leadership, Obama rights.
The North Stream, the new gates for entering Russian gas in Europe.
The North Stream pipeline, which connects Western Europe and Russia directly at the bottom of the Baltic Sea, launches.
It is estimated to be equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian giant gas producer, wanted to clear this event with a pump.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, took part in the last Tuesday on the Baltic coast, between the speech of the orchestra and the search for snacks, in the opening of the North Stream, a new pipeline, which directly unites Russia and Germany under water.
The Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fiion and his Dutch colleague Mart Rutte have returned together a symbolic valve controlling the flow of Russian gas to the Western European network.
The new gas pipeline of 27.5 million additional cubic metres of gas will enter Western Europe every year for the first pipeline of 1,224 km, connecting the Leningrad area to the land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline should be ready at the end of 2012, providing a total of 55,000 cubic metres of gas equivalent to all consumption of France.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already being discussed.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project encountered a severe opposition from Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream will indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding transit through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries have lost some of their power: they will be more difficult to influence Russia, threatening to close up access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of Warsaw's debate, the North Stream did not stop by comparison with the new German-Soviet Pact, aiming at the union between Hitler and Stalin in order to occupy Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
In support of this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security of supply.
But the price of a lack of energy in Europe is because the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europe.
Russia has been able to achieve its understanding of the direct union between Russia and the rich Western countries that consume large amounts of gas and whose own stocks are already on the rise for less than five years.
"This gas pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, it is a new artery that organically binds us," said François Fion, opening the gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent gas contracts are important and politically and economically.
All of this explains the broad smiles on the faces of Gazprom, who were present in large numbers in Lübmin, the point of gas arrival.
The construction of this gas pipeline is a technical milestone.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel locked in concrete to protect it from the anchors of the ship.
It lies at the bottom of the sea, at the middle depth of 200 meters.
To build it, it had to be surrounded by mines left behind by the Second World War.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Muller, the company's press secretary, North Stream.
There was also a need to take many steps to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake with a weight equal to 242 Eiffel Basins, without breaking all over its length, without valves and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project managers refused it, because Sweden was not in a position to force the Russian public company to settle on its shores forever.
"In the event of an accident, we'll cross the gas stream less than a minute," says Jens Muller.
So, in the event of a gas leak in the gas pipeline, it will go into the air.
But this seems to be unlikely constructors that have designed wires, which are estimated to flow only once in 100,000 years.
Control of the state of the gas pipeline will be carried out by a underwater craft carrying the ship for external observation, as well as by an apparatus circulating inside the gas pipeline.
The cigarette-like device is inserted within the pipeway with a diameter of 1 m and is pushed forward by a flow of gas.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at a speed of 3 metres per second, it provides accurate information on any deformation of the metal.
The pipeline was designed for work for 50 years without the need for small repairs.
Gas circulation is carried out only through pressure.
It consists of 200 bar at departure and 100 bar at arrival.
Five companies have pooled efforts to implement the project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51 per cent of the capital.
The remaining are the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), the Netherlands Gasunie and the French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture called the North Stream, which was commissioned to build and operate the gas pipeline.
His headquarters is located in Zug, Switzerland, where tax is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased this company for twenty years with the possibility of extending the total amount of gas transport.
“Gasprom will pay for the full amount, no matter how much gas will actually be transported,” says Jens Muller.
Funding for gas pipeline construction was provided by 30% of shareholders and by 70% of bank loans.
The total cost of the work is 7.4 thousand euros for two pipelines.
GDF Suez will invest about 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will pay their expenses because Gazprom takes all the risks.
The gas pipeline comes from the Baltic Sea in Lübmin on a sandy shore surrounded by pine trees.
The four-metre-high valves form the exhaust terminal.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before switching it to the German gas pipelines.
From last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic metres of gas every hour.
It will be 3 million hours in full power and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine brandy
Moleskine, established by the Italian company 15 years ago, will taste the letter again.
It has the aroma of adventures, the hours performed in the light of the light.
The Moleskine block is easy to find on the right-hand black cover, on the cut, on the yellow-white pages, as if the timers wanted.
However, the Moleskine book, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, located in Milan, decided to sell design blocks.
Maria Sebregondi, the company's consultant at the time, took responsibility for launching a new product.
The block is inspired by an old production technique, a molasses - lacquered cotton cloth, used for example to cover sketches.
It is claimed that this type of block notes are highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has brought into line with today's taste the old and forgotten thing that was culturally for avant-garde artists until the 20th century," said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the dominant brand in Mode Mode.
Good luck.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 25 per cent and reached 12.7 million.
We have gone far away from production in the first few years when all 3,000 block notes were made.
Moleskine crossed the border of Italy and was exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish the profile of a typical buyer because the blocknote is equally attractive to businessmen, students and people of a free profession.
Buyers of Moleskine are cosmopolitan, have broad views and education.
The small Italian company, which initially had only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributed her notes in Fnac bookstores, shops in small towns and was able to acquire a wide range of knowledge.
"We followed the spirit of time and this new need in the letter, despite the e-mail," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This characteristic cultural pattern is accompanied by the development of Moleskine; the brand recently organized the “Environment Path” exhibition, where architects and artists demonstrated their own blocks.
In August, he also launched a Leopard drawing on the case of a film festival in Locarno.
With its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has made a variety of products that now include bags, gloves, computer bags.
The success that led to the addiction: in autumn 2006 Modo Modo was purchased by the Investment Fund SG Capital Europe, currently Syntegra Capital, which has entered a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is unemployment among disabled workers so high?
About 19 per cent of persons with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week of employment of persons with disabilities begins today.
Despite the public welfare policy launched in 2005, the proportion of unemployment among persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average, 19 per cent against 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Is it refreshing?
“No,” stressed Eric Blanche, Director General Adapt, an organization that organizes the week of employment for persons with disabilities.”
"In 15 years, significant progress has been made."
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not 2, but 3 times more."
"There's still a lot of work going on."
It must be said that many more obstacles to employment are still available for disabled people.
Among them are older: 37% over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a lower level of qualifications: 80 per cent do not have the degree of baccalaure, but of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 people with disabilities.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread, which represents 85 per cent for persons with disabilities, compared with 38 per cent on average.
In short, all these criteria make it very difficult to get back to work and are the main problems," says Christian Grapen, Director General of Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about mentality that changes, but too slowly.
The study conducted in April by the IMS-Entrepreneurship Association at Cité ordered showed that the managers in question had a low level of knowledge of disability and that they “represented themselves to the general public in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally inadequate”.
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far away from the target of 6 per cent of persons with disabilities under the law adopted in 1987.
The last known figures for 2008 amount to 2.6%.
"Today we are about 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General Agefiph, organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of “taxed” organizations, as well as the amounts paid, fell from 59,000 to 46,000 organizations in 2007-2011 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Law, which raised taxes, created a strong pressure on the company, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also reflects increased awareness, in particular in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of workers' organizations from 20 to 49 have workers with disabilities against 82 per cent of workers' organizations from 100 to 199.
Azar: "What luck."
Before meeting with the Blues on Tuesday night (20:45) Eden Azar and George Leekens did not hide the pleasure they received from this friendly match.
We won't come to claim that there was a secret agreement between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting near the stadium of Stade de France, George Leekens, and Eden Azar were at peace.
Five months later, a Belgian coach can only praise his attacker against Turkey.
"I'm very pleased with Eden, his promotion and the fact that he's Belgian."
"I want to go further," says Lilla.
As for the contrast between his achievements in the club and assembly, that's the whole thing, he's justified.
"I'm in Little, I'm a round year, and there's no Belgium."
"I have to earn my eyes."
Left in stock, in front of this match with France, in a game against Romania on Friday night, Azar came to St. Danny to finally "blow".
Not forgetting, however, the concept of pleasure.
He supported the Blues from the age of 7 and the winning campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also enhances the particular character of the match.
And especially what is on the other side of Mother (Debushi), Johan (Caba) and Adil (Rami)," he recalls.
"Our paths have just crossed."
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leekens kindly remembered the "glory."
"Glorious" to play in the "festival" game.
"Gloriousness" is also claimed as a "neighbor" that France "has once again become a very high-level team" just a year after the injury in Nyzne.
"Loran Blanc was like a thunderstorm, he admires.
Now that Belgium misses the next Euro, the technical sportsman will fly in one plane with the lead of the blues... in Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he stressed.
"We build something, the games are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will be convinced of this in the future, including this against France."
Portugal is very confident of itself
Portugal started its response match against Bosnia (22:00) on Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way to him, both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paul Benthu is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
He had no doubt that the Assembly, in its role since September 2010, would qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a match to be played, and Bosnia to be won.
In view of the 0-0 on Friday in the Hell of Zenica, it is clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal had dominated the match for more than an hour, it was unable to reach the goal of calming her.
"It's a good result, but it's a risk."
But at its brightly lit de la lus stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will go through, in the eyes of the audience, which should be in a hurry, although the match will be very tense," said optimistically, but judgmental Bent.
"We expect a very tense match, but we are convinced that we can win," said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% chance of being Euro 2012," said the successor, Carlos Cairo.
No one on Friday in a match against Bosnia demands the Portuguese victory.
No one could set up the Bosnians.
"It's a good result, but there's a risk, but it's a pity for Bent.
"We will play against a team with a lot of technical merit and a lot of individual merit," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to put maximum pressure on Bosnians from the very beginning, "don't give them time to think."
A good idea, only this time would be realistic.
