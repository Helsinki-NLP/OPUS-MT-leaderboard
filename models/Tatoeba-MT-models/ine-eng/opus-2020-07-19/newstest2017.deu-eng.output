28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook, recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the house of a local shopping center.
The victim's brother said he couldn't imagine anyone who wanted to hurt him, "Finally it went up with him again."
The Leichnam found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the judicial medical department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as murder and the investigations are ongoing.
The brother of the victim, Louis Galicia, told the ABS Sender KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a cook in Boston, had spent six months in his dream job as a cook at the Sons & Daughters Restaurant in San Francisco.
One speaker of the Son & Daughter said that they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground" over his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and affections are in this difficult time with Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia reported that Frank first lived in hostels, but that, "the things went up for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone who wanted to harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly man with a great heart.
His way of connecting with his family was always to cook something to prepare us for dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who swam with the electricity.
"With everything that's going on in the world, he was this uncut diamond that lit up bright every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the SFPD message phone under number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'll always be stuck in sheets
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has made this unmistakably clear in an interview now.
"I will always be stuck in sheets or get glued from outside label, which most of the time has nothing to do with me and the reality."
"I myself do not wish to be perfect and successful."
"Excuse me, these things are rather cheap."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she is considered "Miss Perfect" as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress spends her time at home, in front of the TV with a lacquer and Mexican food, says it in the magazine.
To the white light she brings the question of the wish for children: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood Star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a children's game" Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film runs with us from August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are observable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some of his colleagues were looking for a little change with an exit on the beach.
For the 58 years it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday evening, they were hunting for the food line home in the fast galop.
A kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And that's how the riding career ended again.
On Saturday Germany's best golfer at all times - 101 tournaments - again near horses.
He and his family were guided by the ALRV system, and on a horse he did not even venture for photo purposes.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was absolutely convincing.
The German sport aid gave the man from the homes of a small gala the Golden Sports pyramid.
There is no lack of awards for the friendly sportsman.
Bundesverdienstreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already named him.
Langer is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it will not only be awarded for sports success, but also for social engagement".
For decades, Langer has been promoting new growth.
And so he went on to pay the price of 25,000 euros.
With 15 more outstanding athletes, the double US master winner was admitted to the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
Among the outstanding are the light athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fetter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruder Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Faher Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the Spring Rider Alwin Schockemölle and the posthumous handballer Erhard Marvellich.
Many of these athletes came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrative company moved to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza prize was held.
Bernhard Langer kept a distance to the big animals.
Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy Compared: It's all about the money
Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.
At the same time, however, the two US presidential candidates are also involved in tax and energy policy as well as in a principle issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamentally philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep them rather small in doubt and warns how the state of the economy can damage them - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
On the other hand, he would be quite different, said Trump.
He will withdraw regulations massively, and he is making himself a large-scale tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to perform, that it has unfavourable opportunities to open up and needs money to do so.
That's why taxes would increase for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.
They have to invest in them, Trump and Clinton say almost equally.
The democratic candidate has announced the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are, for example, strictly rejected by the State-critical Teaparty refugees of the Republicans.
Thus, there could be further internal discussions on Trump.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.
Trump wants to build coal plants and boost coal promotion in the United States.
Oil promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas, which he wants to announce under the Paris Climate Protection Agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand with his investment programme the renewable energies and asks: "A country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."
"It'll be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements - the two competitors are not far from each other.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, does not want to sign both.
At the same time, however, the US does not want to isolate itself from international trade - but just to protect American jobs better.
They're supposed to be better paid, like Clinton.
The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars was a hunger wage.
He wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do in this matter is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be up, then he says he must not be changed.
However, the major discussion of the coming months should rather be developed on the fiscal policy of the two camps.
On one side lies Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens of the country to speed up growth.
His critics believe that the budget deficit would be even greater.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants the rich to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.
Flight: "Every refugee woman has experience with sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost every day.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby, which is at least one year old.
One put her little son in the arm.
He looks with large eyes curiously into the room.
His mother looks at the table.
Until she notices she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little ones.
The scene looks normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the district manager of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance offers in Bavaria, and deals with, among other things, the issue of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the München North in one of the few decentralized accommodation for women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs set up the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
It has been officially opened for a long time.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard in front of the door.
"It is not exaggerated to say that every woman who arrives here has had experiences of sexual violence on her escape," Bahr says.
"Men flee because of wars, because they are politically persecuted, because torture or death threaten them or because their families send them as hope bearers to Europe," she says.
For women, there are many other reasons for escape: "Many steal away from it because they do not see another way out."
In their home, they have experienced sexual violence, forced labour, honorary killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That's what she's doing.
It's on the run.
"For example, the skating for a bottle of water requires sexual action, is not rare," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Whoever thinks it's over, as soon as they get to Germany, wrong, says Bahr.
Here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be viewed as inferior and abused at least.
This means that about 90 percent of the women who live in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, estimated.
"Some of the children are certainly not voluntarily created."
Many women are so used to saying nothing.
"Or they do not trust to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too great."
Since they often didn't know how to help, it only needs more accommodation for them, calls for Bahr.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
To the question whether they knew of a similar project as in Munich in their area of responsibility, some answer with no.
There is, for example, no such thing in the superpowers of governments.
Even in Schwaben, refugee women are not kept separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, government press speaker.
In Oberbayern, sub- and medium-sized enterprises there are floors or own houses in some community accommodation only for women and their children.
The exception is Lowerbayern, there are two central accommodation only for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be treated separately from men.
In a study published for the Committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women are accommodated separately."
"If the privacy is lost or men and women are held together, violence against women can happen - in the long run."
Above all, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, as stated in the study.
How much the women feel about this protection need can be seen at the Andrang, which is on the house in Munich.
"Since it has been said that there are us, we have a long waiting list," Bahr says.
You could easily open a second house.
Helped syringes: Demands for new work-related measures
Representatives of the assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new measures to combat their disputes with regard to a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire Council to approve more work campaigns from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that it had failed to address the concerns of the contract.
Assistant doctors and medical students agreed in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members published on Thursday evening on Twitter, JDC President Ellen McCourt said that the government would remain "absolutely calm" about problems, leading to the rejection of the treaty.
She said, "In view of this, the JDC Board has agreed to reject the proposed new treaty completely and has requested official renegotiation to all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board today has formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating action, beginning in September.
The disputes led to assistants covering six times this year, the first total losses in the history of the NHS.
BMA’s assistant doctor Dr. Johann Malavana withdrew after the election to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which were still held before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students, that the contract should be beneficial and adopted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be enforced.
Russia and Turkey: "A Alliance of Foreign Sides"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight-month ongoing war of words and economic sanctions.
But as Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the golden hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was the handcuff, yes.
But Putin's smile seemed narrow and he barely radiated heat, even for his lingering conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "love friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but would even improve.
The next day described a newspaper that Erdogan would have become so familiar that something bad would never happen.
I thought his enthusiasm would be the opposite.
But one of Putin's sustainable coolers showed that the head of state of Russia had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction words: the removal of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow's reaction to the time was burned out.
Putin announced and accused Ankara of falling behind Russia.
The sin was even greater, as it was initiated by a supposed friend.
It will be difficult to rebuild the veto if it is not even impossible.
The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months the government-controlled media launched a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
At one time it seemed that the Turks would bear the blame for everything.
Most seriously, the charges of leading officials were that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in the areas of Syria, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He fought a lot.
But in St.Petersburg, the official message said it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia was able to win a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan needs, first of all, all the friends he can get after he was removed from his office in a damaged state strike last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also scared him.
But there are also economic reasons.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia, travel organizers and charter companies will be made easier when flights are retaken.
They count on a lateral storm to the Mediterranean.
This week, the state television forecasted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry to the west because it considers its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.
To this end, the constant fluctuation of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is intended to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce Turkey's relationship to the west - is the constant fluctuation.
The Russian head of state in Ankara has certainly won a bonus for requesting support for the elected state bodies after the attempted state strike.
This is well-known for Moscow's self-understanding, which itself has a profound fear of changing regimes.
The summit meeting in this beautiful palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to represent one, as an analyst once described me, "the Alliance of External Sides": two countries that are breaking down from the west and feeling badly treated and now unite.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as a peace-building foundation, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It could be significant that, after almost three hours of first discussion, the two presidents said at the press conference that they had not even addressed the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey launches the Russian fight - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand is intended to be reduced to a back office role, according to the Bank’s chief executive.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the Bank's global ambitions.
Since then, the Bank has distanced itself from almost eight years ago when it had to be collaborated and saved.
At this time, brand strategies have used "RBS" to protect other end-user financial markets.
She supported international sport with millions of pounds on sponsoring, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to put more national brands into focus.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the central headquarters and the stock exchange will be changed to Natwest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the private customer business that are more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told the BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we will now become more a brand bank."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I now say that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work under these brands with customers.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer pursue its Six Nations Sponsoring and that it will increase the credibility of the various brands in its sport sponsoring.
"It is time for us to develop into a bank of brands, because how do we concentrate inside (we have asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the Chief Executive Officer.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can relaunch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves his 3,000th Newmarket Award at Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000 wins
The Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a milestone on predication, which is trained by John Gosden, on his local race with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won Ghayyar before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very modest.
Dettori captures the jubilee when he wins the victory on predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, who nine-time Derbysiers had 4,493 careers
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times and it's no surprise that he's reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from others in the space of weight control.
He has been a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma fan for years for this kind of sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have already won 6,000 if he wasn't just a weekend and a big tournament jockey!
Frankie has already won almost 30 years in GB, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but in addition he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismonent
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismonunts, Frankie Dettori has been the hangman of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of major tournaments, including his famous "Glorichen Seven" 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had difficulties at first when he returned from his six-month suspension, but he showed an impressive character strength to overcome his doubts and return to his best form.
And he's not long in the end - Dettori once said he wants to continue in competitions until his 50th year of life.
Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's narrowest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
In an opinion of the Kremlin, Putin said that, without any reason, "the discharge of Ivanov's duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration has been arranged".
Anton Vaino, who has been a representative of Ivanov since 2012, has been appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin website it is said (in Russian) that he was later chief of protocol and chief of government staff.
About his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that it is the government's most important task to support your work as head of state with regard to draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his posts and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Are the smiling faces convinced?
This step has made Moscow a secret environment.
Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest to Vladimir Putins and worked as he did for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcast on TV, the two men claimed that the chief of staff would come back on his own request.
But despite the smile on the cameras, there are only a few of them that are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So here is the consequences of a kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that right now.
But the official claim - that a man who was once summoned as a potential president wants to lead the Russian environmental policy at once - was on big skeps.
In his comments to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it's true that I had asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to trust these very complicated posts - you could almost say - complaints for four years.
As it turns out, I have been President of the Russian Presidency for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the posts in December 2011.
Previously, he was the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB State Security Service as Putin.
In the late 1990s, Putin was president of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
As Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people he trusted most.
It was once assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, since a third term of office would have violated Putin's constitution.
But these posts were taken by another close-up allies of Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he beat producers
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month at the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced their termination in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized to the public on Thursday before announcing his termination.
In the set there were artistic differences and differences of opinion.
I regret the incident," he said in a statement.
Details of how the character Gibsons from the series followed by an FBI team of agents will be published, according to the opinion of the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, at a later date.
The 54-year-old who previously played in Sitcom Dharma & Greg was with him since the first staffing of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and I've inserted my whole heart blood for the last 12 years," Gibson said in a message published on Friday.
I had hoped to be at the end of it, but it will not be possible now.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned radiation of the 12th staff is set on 28 September.
Puzzles about fish landed in gardens in Banff
A resident of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandals that were emitted from a spring well.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, published a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone might throw something light on the appearance of the two-inch long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected with Fife
The £1.35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern deck of Queensferry Crossings to the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of the four locks of the "dark breeze", which closes to the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 strips.
The £1.35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown made a visit today and was one of the first to go from country to country to bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the road and the bridge deck is a great activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the passage.
In total, almost 79% of the total bridge decks are in place and the last section of the deck today in Rosyth receives a concrete cover for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be raised on the bridge at its place.
Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first closure is a major milestone in each bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents future-oriented construction.
After the installation of the last section of the road end and its connection to the north tower deck in the expansion, we had to close the existing gaps on the north side or the country side.
This was achieved by pulling the north bridge 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and at the same time very hot activity.
Massive, since the route is 222 meters long, approximately 6,000 tonnes weigh and had to be pulled up from about 3%.
Heikel, since the tolerances that the team had worked on were modest - on each side they saw only a few millimeters.
Luckily, everything went very well.
Rescue in the Moelfree Bay: Three Men Have "Happiness Still in Life"
Three men have "happiness to be alive" after being thrown by their fishing boat before England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck on Friday at 13:20 BST alarm after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming safely while their boat moved on from its own strength.
"We saw how the boat in its vicinity turned around and presented the worst," said the manager of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Happyly, the strong winds have already weighed the boat beyond their reach until we leave it to water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a boje without rescue.
They all arrived on board the coast rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who have been thrown into the water have been unharmed and still alive.
The boat engine had an emergency stop point, but the boat got rid of the person who controlled the boat while the boat was in the center of the boat.
Someone's been waiting for these men today.
Severely injured - man stands on his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had the key to his apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholics cut off his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
When she came into the apartment, he stepped in on her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured by hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the killer.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
This one alarmed his sister.
Together with her companion, the 45-year-olds wanted to calm down their brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
So she went out of the house with her companion.
On the street they met the ex-life companion of the man.
When the two women reentered the apartment, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig?
The SPD and Greens mean that investors will be given much more responsibility in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that in the next few years, Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments?
The SPD proposes for the next Council meeting a "occupational housing" concept.
But the dispute is programmed.
First of all, the question is, Who should actually build the cheap apartments?
There's been a lack of regulation so far.
SPD fractional president Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: Whoever wants to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments in the future."
However, the cheap apartments can also be created in the stock.
However, the big argument in the Council was, so Bratmann said, "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private premises?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 per cent on such areas, but at least 20 per cent of the apartments as social housing."
A new urban housing development programme, which will cost millions and still have to be financed, should provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is still no agreement between the groups."
The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.
The link still wants tough orders for investors.
Despite this, so Bratmann, there is an increase in the situation on the housing market.
If the concept of action is implemented, additional tasks will be provided in the construction management.
More staff is needed.
It's unclear if we're going to get the experts.
However, the program is still not complete: because about 1260 new apartments should be built anyway.
How, though, does the loss of more than 1300 favourable apartments, whose promotion will take place in the coming years?
By 2020 alone there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, the planning political speaker Nicole Palm should now be bought from the city.
In addition, it was necessary to consider bringing apartments back to the price bond.
It's possible in the West City.
At one point, the problem was solved.
Because in the West City, the deadlines are coming to an end.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price bond for cheap apartments.
Only: This is what the owners do not want, the housing companies.
Because the number of social apartments in the West City is being dramatically increased, one is separated from the objective of the so-called intermix.
There should be no more concentration of social weaknesses in just a few districts.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the debate.
Group president Holger Herlitschke says: "For a large majority, the CDU must be in the boat."
Although they have concentrated on more construction sites for single-family homes.
What does not mean, however, that a compromise cannot be found yet.
Pokémon Go, a Hunt for Health and Happiness That Rewards
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time in order to starve on screens has been reproached by many in the last decade.
At Pokemon Go, it's about getting people out of the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially on the TV, then on video games and lastly limited on smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technologies and activities in the free do not exclude each other.
I refer, of course, to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (there were later a cartoon series, games cards and other spin-offs).
Like many pop culture phenomena, the interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand fell somewhat early in July.
The market introduction in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the server overloaded.
In less days, Pokémon Go had more users than teenagers and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go out with their smartphones and search for Pokémons that are followed by a GPS and, as soon as they have been found, can be "photographed" (over a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".
A generation who played the game when it was even younger, joined the fool and ran for the search for the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person makes every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which follows 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of followed-up people who train 30 minutes each day rose from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to bring to it "take 30 minutes of time," "from the sofa to come" and "to be active every day" are on deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look sad.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.
Those who drive regular sports reduce their chances of suffering from cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to bring them here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that makes them fun.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunlight as well as fun.
Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.
As always, there are also Murrian game destroyers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What's up?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit had already been able to track our activity, they gave us no reason to drive sports as this game does.
The new one will lose its reiz and the use will be left with time.
However, thanks to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the active value in the real world and help many people to be active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in the dammenten
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jump horse.
Don't bother on the bar.
Breathing on the ground.
On the whole line brilliant.
And now finally also a champion of the Olympics.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American tournament turned into a multi-racial title and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the lights of the Olympics.
Its total score of 62,198 was clearly in front of the Silver Medal Winner and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian Bronze Medal Winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American women Simone Biles tour the swimming pool during the solo competition finale of the women in the art tournament at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-fighting title and totals the fifth, while holding her name to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment ended.
This success puts her in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought her sports to new heights:
In the last three years, Billes has mastered her sport, 15 world championships - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mix of pride and precision that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton of her said she was "the best tournament I've ever seen."
She expected a final test in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Billes and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.
Not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, return to Texas, would be seen as a disappointment.
The Americans, Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hugged each other after winning gold and silver at the single-marriage finals of women in the arts tournament at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exhumation sign at the retreating festival of the team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Billes was on it, during her long journey to the top, never to have planned the future, that is not really true.
Part of her ground exercises - which contain her typical Tumbling pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympiarena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child, was discovered by Coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the tournament, in which Boorman was trained, became a force.
She has not lost a multi-racial competition since the summer of 2013, a series that will be held as long as Billes wants.
Even if Mustafina led easily through two turns, the picture weighed down.
Swivel bars and floor towers - in which Billes holds the world's title.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the swivel bar and set up another one on the ground with a 15,933 on the floor.
Raisman hugged her gently when she expected her final performance - a pure formality - and tears flowed to Billes brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
The performance of Raismans was a racke for the last four years when she fought around the third place, but the bronze medal went into a tiebrake at Mustafina.
This time the 22-year-old team captain named Oma had a lead.
After her practice, she threw kiss hands at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared doubtful.
As for Billes, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a brand new significance:
Police: 3 victims shot in serial murder while listening to music in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot in one of the most deadly attacks in Phoenix's first serial murder for a decade while they were sitting in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis Daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June, while the car was parked in an entrance, the authorities said.
The shooter fired eight shots from a handgun, while he stood on the side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, is to be read in the report.
The police reported that the three-time murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker did not include the pockets or $2,900 that were owned by one of the adults.
The police spokesperson of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the shooter to become a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
Overall, seven persons were killed in Spanish residences within four months in nine attacks and two others were injured.
"It happens in a residential location in front of a house," said Howard of KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Linear, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died on site.
One witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and hear music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting that aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the three-time murder and is expected to be the work of the serial killer.
The investigators found cartridge holes and secured a ball from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microzephalie: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But like the least of his peers, Edmund microzephalie, the result of a genetic disorder about which his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, it was my first thought, I couldn't do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't sign up for that.
What's not at all right -- of course you've been able to do that," she said.
Your husband Vincent and you have been told that Edmund will never be able to recognize her under circumstances and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest institutionalize him.
"My first answer to that was 'I didn't know that people were still doing,' said Picciuto.
Edmund can run with help.
Edmund could not sit or scratch until his third year of life and he can't even talk.
But he's making slow progress.
He can run with support and bike.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund intended for "please sing something for me"."
"We bring him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some characters alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetics such as Edmund and infections with viruses such as masts or zikavirus during pregnancy.
The symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly.
It is too early to tell how it will affect the life of those infected with zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking what was going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I haven't asked for the forecast for a long time, because I don't expect her to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the zikavirus.
It's getting better.
You know it's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, floods give rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfalls and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the Governor to call out the emergency on Friday. It will be calculated all Saturday with more rainfalls.
Numerous rivers in Southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rainfalls, the National Weather Service reported.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that government officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and help to the affected communities is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparation, shared that the demands for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags increased.
Steele said that only the municipality of Tangipahoea had required tens of thousands of sandbags.
A flood warning system is used over large parts in southern Louisianas until Saturday.
The weather service made it clear that additional 3 to 5 duties could fall on rain in this area.
In southern Alabama, an early warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the area of Mobile.
The river committee near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will reach all probability after the weekend record level.
Metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could swim many houses in the area near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a river-side navigation in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as they will flow only slowly through the affected rivers into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level on Friday at 9 a.m., which was ever recorded.
Rescue teams were still training people from the river water in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those who were saved near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose strongly over the night.
He said he would have been warned by another step son who lives nearby.
"We are awake and the water flowed and flowed in," said Hansford.
It reached my size.
His wife said that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a height of the river.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he would be the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency aid had saved all three of them in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire department in Gloster, where they were staying until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flooding had "extensively spread" as there were still heavy rainfalls and that the authorities considered evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer reported around Livingstone from midnight until Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain.
Krautmann said that the soil has been very thorough since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that heavy rains and road crossings caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoea Parish and educational failure in five school districts.
The CBS Subsidiary WWL reported that a Commandant in Tangipahoe 200 reported floating houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, both of which were now flooded.
The head of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were washed by the high water.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodations were set up to accommodate the evacuated.
"As soon as the water starts to recuperate, they will be able to return to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoea, almost two dozen streets were closed due to the high water and sandbags were provided for the inhabitants to take in, hoping to keep the water from their houses and shops.
"The last big flooding we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it was still raining on the Gulf Coast.
According to his statements, a handful houser on Thursday was to be reported as overfishing, but on Friday was not reported until now.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "Bouldered by Balls", survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police report that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week the second time that a 6-year-old child will be shot.
The boys' grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents indicated that Brown suffered several gun injuries, including in the country, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was conscious when he was transporting to the hospital.
"He has done a lot, his small body has been pierced by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the sender.
I just can't believe it.
The condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the messenger that he was expected to recover.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are according to CBS Philadelphia in stable condition.
The boy was shot at the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old who is in a critical state, reports the sender.
The other two victims were not found in the car and the police found out whether they could be among the injured men of the perpetrators.
The investigator informed CBS Philadelphia that it apparently had come to a crossfire between several shields.
Pattern holes for storms that have been traced back to different storms exceeded the tatort.
It seems that this has clearly been an ongoing struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the road, there were Hulsen.
This seems to have been the case here with several armed fighters who were very actively involved," police chief Anthony Ginaldi of the Police in Philadelphia told the sender.
Several houses and vehicles have also been hit in the area.
There were no arrests and the police are currently checking reports according to the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a crossbow at the arm when she played in front of her house in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane.
She recovers and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I'm about to introduce myself to the women's Olympic team in the tournament for more than one reason.
For the first time since 1984, I have been at every summer Olympics and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three tournaments, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which have inspired many young girls of other skin color.
The structure of this team, Aly Raisman, who is a Jew and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has confirmed the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number was one among the women's tournaments as an African American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
In the last Olympic games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and American.
Now the world was able to be witnesses of the incredible performance of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were not expecting, but were delivering masterly gymnastic routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American to win an individual multi-fighting event for women gold.
Team member Aly Raisman won Silver.
We experience the tops of this kind of sport, but that's how tournaments don't look all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all joined the same route as Aly and Madison to create it for the Olympic team.
You are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will have only four tournaments in the team. Also, last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach.
But the reality seems to be that Turnen is a expensive sport and Turner in the first place in private tournaments that are maintained by parents for training, institution, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for coaches and their tournaments and families). The list can be continued whenever possible.
The majority of these tournaments are located in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.
In these associations the tournaments receive their entire training and this is a expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started with the tournament.
We need to enable the communities, even countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to provide a more affordable and more accessible tournament training.
I've founded my 20-year-old tournament.
At my events, we offered free and affordable tournaments in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and Spanish) and train national and international winners.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the young high-quality tournaments that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turns develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the spirit.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It is the inspiration of this team to bring thousands of young girls into the tournament and that is great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
It's such an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real performance of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you for having so many young girls motivated with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistants would like to organize further strikes after they rejected Jeremy Hunts' proposal
The ministers had hoped to be able to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants who voted in a vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to enforce the contract and said that the NHS was in a "Niemandsland" and that any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.
The first assistants are expected to receive a new contract containing changes to night and week work in order to improve the maintenance of ungastic hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee on Assisting Doctors last night, said in a statement: "Assistant Doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will exacerbate the current staff crisis and reduce it to treat all doctors fairly."
In just eight weeks that remain until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.
Efforts on behalf of the BMA to resolve disputes through talks have increased in the government to participate in protests and sometimes in deafening silence.
This happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made last month that his door would always open.
"Jeremy Hunt has to act now, lift the suction and address the concerns of the assistants."
If he does not do so, the assistants have made it clear that they are ready to take further action to combat this disease.
The last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and doctors were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the strike chain.
The ministers had hoped to be able to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly salary for the 54,000 assistants who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of NHS Staff, asked the assistant doctors to stop the strike.
Mortimer said: "Employment measures do not reach anything but load overloaded teams and service providers and prepare patients, caregivers and their families only worry, need and interruption."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee on Health Assistance and with the Ministry of Health and other ministries to respond positively to concerns about pre-mortem and whistleblowing.
Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as dispatch, flexibility in training, additional training for those who return from a professional break, training courses, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and gender-specific wage cases in medicine - would have been a sign of how serious it was for employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in respect of compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-per-day medication that can reduce cardiac pharmacology
Thousands of heart heart patients will benefit from a £2-per-day medication after the authorities have recommended that this be given more people for a longer period of time.
The anti-inflammatory medicine ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart disease for people with heart disease.
The medicine is already given 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS NICE regulatory authority recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS NICE regulatory authority recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Cardiac heart disease and strokes are caused by collection of fat-containing materials in the arterial walls that form the surfaces.
If the disease breaks out, it can cause a blood vessel that closes the blood flow to the heart and thereby causes a heart attack.
If the blood vessel dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and close the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood vessels more unlikely.
The NICE guide, which has been published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90 mg ticagrelor followed by 60 mg with twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have had a heart attack, another heart attack or stroke often have disastrous consequences."
Fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative effect on a person’s quality of life.
Experience has shown that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a provisional recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft guidelines do not recommend treatment beyond this period.
Culture of political correctness allows election fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year to issue a government report for corruption from the office
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being significantly ignored as a destructive government report revealed today.
The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and councillors to have ignored evidence of abuse due to "responsibility to ethnicity and religion".
The former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government, now a king of corruption, said that the intimidation of voters for religious reasons would be such a bad thing that the police should be allowed to set up unarmed bands outside the electoral booths to protect frightened voters.
He recommends that voters take a statement with them to prove their identity in elections.
Currently, a voters must name only their names and addresses.
The report proposes to apply non-removeable ink to a person's finger if they give their vote in order to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistleblower should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He called for the press to have more access to community statements and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
"This not only serves to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that is involved," he said.
The report was commissioned by the Downing Street as a result of the Hamlet Tower Election Canal in East London.
Last year, a special election court decided that acting mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his office in accordance with a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynic way" and that he had brought his critics into silence with racist and Islamophobia charges.
Rahman "is supposed to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a succession in which a person chooses other than someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed himself particularly alarming at the misleading letter - the older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate for their election.
Sir Eric, represented, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including the conduct of demonstrations to prove the identity
Its report states: "As evidence that pressure on members of certain ethnic minorities was exerted, in particular women and young people, in order to choose, according to the will of the elderly, in particular, communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"There was concern that... state institutions would have significantly ignored such behaviour due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the prohibition that political activists edit newsletters to stop "whallers".
The report, considered by Theresa May, also requires stronger registration checks to prevent the use of the electoral directory for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters before choosing your statement.
Use non-removeable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
To carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible for election.
A three-year limitation on applications for automatic lettering.
It prohibits political activists from editing complete letters and envelopes of letters.
The police give the authority to put a stop to election stations.
An amendment which facilitates a prosecution for intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Volksrepresentungsgesetungs 1983).
Photographic ban in election stations.
The requirement that only English should be used in the polling stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees comply with the rule that voters go alone into the election cabin.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "wonderful", that after the Hamlets Tower case no criminal notice was given.
"The election court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices as inadvertent," he said.
He was found guilty for a number of reasons - in accordance with the high requirements of criminal law - for reasons.
It also criticises the ineffective "abstract controls" of the electoral registration departments of the Councils.
Sir Eric said, "The court order in Tower Hamlet last year was a warning signal.
Our country as the mother of Parliament is a proud heritage, but the worrying and hidden spread of election fraud and the lying of some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Crazy for Kates Radler Double Passer and other famous double passersby of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have arrived this week on the French bike athlete Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, apart from the edge and band, which has proved to be an impressive double-walker of the Duke of Cambridge.
But this summer, 24-year-old Olympics is not the only one fighting for gold, who shows his own famous double-walker - at least not if you can give social media faith.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that flash on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than a certain similarity to Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and the wolf: team member of the US team in the bending of Brady Ellison, left, since his childhood, will be compared with Leonardo DiCaprio
Apart from Kate's double-walker on the bike, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain bowhead of the twinning of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio could be.
The team member of the U.S. team in the bow shot, Brady Ellison, caused a riot on Twitter after appearing images that he saw in secret similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star.
In fact, the bowshoe got the sense in the social media and added that he's already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I see no great similarity myself, with the exception of facial behaviour," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'm gonna make it up to you as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since 2012 will undoubtedly become even more central this year: the increasing similarity between the British wide jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian tournament Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes is supposed to be able to pass through as a double pass for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
One step higher: This user is the view that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the perception actor
Another constant comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnet, who has similarly severe eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova shows more than just the sun-burned skin and blonde hair like the actor Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was certified by Fans to equal a "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: Footballstar Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others also happened the similarities
Theory placed in the room: According to this user there may be a reason for the similarity of the pair
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smiles, which is almost identical to that of actor Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in the Gabby Douglas tournament, who presents her own beautiful, wide smile, similar to that of the bear It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "like a pig died"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at Dr. 4x200m outdoor swimming staff empirical viewer of the CBC live transmission of the Olympics on Wednesday
The Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "was missing" and during the race as "a pig died".
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m outdoor swimming pool.
MacDonald, who was taken to the CBS Commentary Team on board to give more "color", could be heard to say, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby".
Too excited, it went away like mief, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the swimming staff 1:57,79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canadians to close the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "how a pig died?"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on mission."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m outdoor swimming pool for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Criticism against Byron MacDonald came on Twitter quickly and hard when many put him on the stand
Twitter users didn't stay back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradise wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists.
Shortly thereafter Scott Russell, who moderated the CBC transmission, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize for the comment on a swimming power."
It was an unfortunately-chosen formulation, and we're sorry it happened."
CBC apologized at the end more than 90 times to the people who responded to the comment on Twitter
Commentary colleague Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and posted his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a communication.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers yesterday night on the mission and our followers in the social media.
To clarify one, Byron's comments refer to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
However, they were unmet and an unfortunately chosen formulation. Byron does what he said, very sorry.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the mission and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimsuit in the CBC Olympisung," he said.
"I've been referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, there was no misunderstanding and I'm very sorry."
Buyer in Primark empires about a woman who tastes in the middle of the store unsanitary underwear
The buyers didn't know where to look when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a price to try underwear.
To make the situation worse, she had to look at it, pull it out and put it back into the realm.
She continued to push and tried four pairs of underwear in a store at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.
The Primark Business at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underwear before she put her back into the store
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she drew back and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "The people could not believe what they saw."
In the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underwear out of the exhibition, pulled out her own stockings and pants and tried them.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, like Oskar."
"Everyone stared when she pulled out the underwear that she obviously didn't like, as she put it back in the gift."
She repeated the same with three other underwear before she finally decided that she didn't like anything, pulled back and went out.
"They didn't seem to mind that they watched someone - or think about the person who would buy the underwear she had tried under circumstances."
Mrs. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How can it be counterproductive to think that someone would take underwear with him home, who hated another person and didn't wash them?"
The event took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs. Davidson added: "As I got along, the employees tried to get the clothes out of the sale after she went - which is just as good."
"I'd hate to go home with a new pair of underwear and find out that another woman had caught her and pulled her out again and they weren't washed."
A speaker from Primark said: "Prmark is aware of the event that took place on Tuesday, August 9, in our branch office in Folkstone."
All the products in question were withdrawn from the sale.
How to Protect Yourself With Krav Maga From Arms Attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a major master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbery at close distance.
Whether you are approached from the front or from the back, this video will show you how you turn the spear for your predator.
When approaching you from the back, you should turn around as the first, so that you can see your attacker and "turn yourself out of the fire line," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting him with your free elbow.
Then beat him with the knee into the joint and turn, while the attacker bends before pain, the weapon out of his hands. Hit him with the running into his face and move back while they fix the weapon on him.
In the case of attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the fire line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, put the weight on the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the weapon out of his grip before they move back and fix the weapon on him.
Does it sound hard?
Look at the video to see exactly how it is made by Mizrachi.
But think of it as the safest thing for a thief to hand over your money - unless you are a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright misses his tongue for a tour guide to the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveler subjected his immune system and the Würreflex to a serious test - by covering some of Europe's most filthy and noblest places.
The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk lost his trains on a Euro-Schenine, a land on the Piccadilly Circus, a wash button on a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of his immune system.
Before skunking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will apply to.
But the experiment filmed under the title "The Lickhicker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results to the day.
The idea of separating the wash button from a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely indiscriminate, but in fact, there are more poor bacteria in one kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of Darbacterial bacteria and about his own health.
Luckily, he left nothing that he said more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestines by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public places to railway stations to toilets, the task was definitively tested by its immune system.
In the film, he told me, "Just as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health, and I have put all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and muddy water."
In the film, he was entitled to his reputation in any case.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
Its sample range showed a number of luminometers of over 4000 units.
Compared to this, the number of luminometers of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to separate after its luminometer number was more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of milk products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhicker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the film he says, "This is the worst thing I've ever had in a toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to put anything in here because it's stupid in here.
"The Lickhicker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of milk products Valio.
Mr. Wright is a company with Valio Gephilus, which contains both milk acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of Darbacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Businesses and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We carried through crazy brainstorms that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claimed that the interest in oral health will become a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of stomach health and how it is associated with the immune system.
The growing interest in oral health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film, we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the director of the film, added: "Let me tell you this - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had looked at some of the things I had told him to lick, like the noble Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things that made it easier to bring Ian to draw them and others with whom this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we've taken some of these dirty candy on film."
In a survey carried out by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all surveyed dairy acid bacteria were associated, in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they used at least occasionally products containing added dairy acid bacteria.
Social family destroyed before delogation Social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
A social family left their social apartment after a deposit with a damage of £500,000 because it had terrorized their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were cast after a long list of complaints by their property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their estate, shocked employees of the housing company found the property in an irreparable condition.
The walls showed striking holes, wood pieces were torn up, dust was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared to the walls.
The family was relocated and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the household administration at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repairing.
She said, "It was an absolute dream for the people here, and I think people don't have to live this way.
There are many things to take into account, as this property is likely to be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is announced and her name is also.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that had added the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidators of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, fighting and running.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the rental contract, received an order for anti-social behaviour in June.
In some rooms of the house that will be destroyed under circumstances, old garbage was found
In the history of drug trafficking, the wood parts were cut off
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police
Cornwall Housing delogated her and her partner this week violently from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to withdraw voluntarily.
Delogation was enjoyed by easier neighbors who said their lives were made hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times that we say to the police here are incredible.
"Today we couldn't sleep."
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighborhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said it would have failed the family to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
On the week-long side of the town house, trash and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant neglected to assume any responsibility for her behaviour and for her family, since a deposit is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into account.
This was a very difficult case, since the behavior was extreme and their actions for their neighbors had to be horribly taken into account.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, and members of the community who have courageously come to us and have allowed us to receive the information.
I hope that this development will give some neighbours comfort and the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress that will be left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the depositation on the ground
Workers of the House Administration will now have to remove Müllberge that surrounds the House
In 2014, the police conducted a razzia in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as wagons, paraphernalia and cash of £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she had been guilty of possession of a drug of Class B in commercial interest.
She claimed that the money for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were without cover, Tanya and her partner are expected to live in a private apartment in Plymouth.
Many rooms in the house were decorated with graffiti.
The police say they'll delogate tenants who don't stick to the house rules.
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police told us that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not adhere to the house rules.
"This is for those who think they can handle themselves without self-defense and for those who have been damaged by such behavior," she said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists move in Portugal in panic after a deep-flighted military beach
Sun worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft of the Air Force launched an incredible storm flight
Air Force reported that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk.
This was the moment when frightened tourists began to panic after a deep - flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost nearby over the sunflowers on the beach section of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers rose when they understood how they began to worry about the noise of the thunderstorms, without first seeing what had come upon them through the clouds.
The incident occurred last afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidayers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By in the social media, said, "It really flew over twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt as if the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were in panic when the plane came from the darkness and incredibly deep flight
Today, the Portuguese Air Force reported that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats on the coast and so deep it had to fly that this was the only way to identify them.
The speaker said that Jet, due to poor visual conditions, was somewhat lower than usual air traffic, but the air forces insisted that safety was not threatened at any time.
Surface fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, where four people also died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces today reported that the pilot had to fly so deep because of the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - that his vision was limited.
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot fishing boat had to identify as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with worry against Seville
Seville - The FC Barcelona fights the first step on Sunday to win the first title in the new football season.
The Catalans enter the duel around the Spanish Supercup outside against the FC Seville, the back game rises three days later in Camp Nou.
The double winner must, in the strengths of the underground Cup finalists and the ruling European League champion, among others, abandon Neymar, who fights with Brazil the Olympic football tournament.
Goalia Marc-Andre is also missing.
In training, the German suffers a knee-breeding, at least in favour of Claudio Bravo, which explains the one-off question at Barca.
The Chilean International and Ter Stepen have been betting in Barcelona for two years as number one.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far ignored a clear decision and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stepen in most of the remaining applications.
Before the first mandatory game of the new play time, the Spanish master has doubts about the fitness status of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game by Liverpool with 0:4.
Even at 3:2 in the rehearsals against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Mesi and Co. did not really know how to convince.
Sevilla, on the other hand, has the 2:3 descent after the extension of the European Supercup against Real Madrid and strives for the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona has so far won eleven record winners in this competition.
Ma Long in a own league for table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis player.
On Thursday in Rio de Janeiro, the 27-year-old defeated his countryman and "titler" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12,5,4,4) in a one-sided final.
The world rankings first achieved the Golden Grand Slam with success at WM, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and even Olympia.
Bronze went to Japaner Jun Misutani.
The two Chinese made it as expected in the game of the end and turned out to be the title of each other.
So it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would get the single title in the symbol of the five rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top of the Olympic Troops was the former SVS-NÖ legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left on the plate alone, between the sets and at time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the courts and left their shields in fair competition alone.
"The matches have been playing for my country so far."
"In the finals I play for me," Zhang said in a follow-up manner.
Gold and silver medal winners placed after the party with the Chinese flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly unilateral.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
Then he determined the pace on the plate and left Zhang there only 13 points in total.
Due to Ma’s superiority, the expected match did not develop.
However, they were not disappointed enough to see a stunning change in the ball.
Mizutani won the bronze game against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
In his quarter final against German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the white Russian had suffered a rape injury, was then in medical treatment, had to "lastly" deal with Blech.
The Swedish Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) have also become similar to high table-age Olympia fourths.
Donald Trump settles ′′ violent problems in the election struggle
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is charged with massive concerns, including in traditional conservative federal states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now exposed the weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republican Hochburg Utah.
A rare moment in which the normally large-scale and self-evident multimillionaire expressed such concerns as correspondents reported.
After he threw 16 rivals within his own Republican camp out of the race, the doubt of his success in fighting the White House grew.
"We have violent problems in Utah," Trump told Evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Due to false reports about his candidacy, he again took up his famous media records.
Waking Republican High Burgen
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a survey by SurveyUSA in June, Trump and his rival of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were on the same footing.
Other institutions see Trump ahead, however, not with the distance usual for Republican candidates in the Federal State.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered at risk.
In an interview with the CNBC broadcaster Trump answered the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton's first march again: "Just like I've done so far."
And look behind: This will "either be successful, or I will make a very beautiful, long holiday".
He does nothing but "tell the truth".
If it's not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, then that's all right, Trump said.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump party is threatened to raise funds to support its election campaign, so it should not be able to present better survey values.
Instead, we want to get the candidates for the Congress stronger among the poor.
Olympia: Dreister fraud at Doping Test
The IOC wants to set up a Disciplinary Commission on the case.
Kenya's light athletes threaten after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro Uncompassed.
After a fraud attempt at a doping check in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee was informed that it would immediately set up a Disciplinary Commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had reported that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, in the Olympic village had given a urine sample under the name of the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported by the Doping Controls team leader Kenya.
The world association IAAF asked the IOC for information on the case in order to conduct its own investigations, an IAAF speaker told him.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC, the IAAF will conduct an evaluation," said an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) has gone to the Doping Control Station and has issued himself as Ferguson Rotich, who passed the tests and signed," said Kenya's Chief of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He had the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list for training checks by the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich became over 800 meters in 2015 in Beijing World War I.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan Lite Athletics-Delegation Chief Michael Rotich was removed from the Rio games.
He is supposed to have informed against payments by athletes in his country about upcoming doping tests.
According to media reports, he was to be arrested on his return to the airport of Nairobi.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC following numerous doping operations for a long time.
In the announcement of the IOC's more than 2000 Doping target controls in front of the Rio games, it was unusually pointed out that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia are being taken into sight.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the beginning of the Olympics.
As a result, WADA Kenya took from the list of countries whose doping combat is in accordance with the WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The light athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a number of TV reports of the ARDs, there have been repeated allegations that the Kenya Doping funds are easily accessible and that there should be a significant mentality of the sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently requested a similar study in Kenya, as he had employed it in the Russian light athletics.
It could be demonstrated that in this sport it was covered and systematically baptized.
Russia's light athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In Shakespeare's year, the Salzburg Festivals present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple, like Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leonardo Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classical and fulfilled the role of Mary as a youth dream.
In orchestral tombs the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm", he sighs.
We always say that she's very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.
It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I'd say we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this stage, Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all, because she's musically extraordinary!
And then it would still be Mary's personality.
She says in her song, "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and white and bright".
So she's smart, of course also naive, and very passionate.
"She likes me very much, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," said Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honor to work with her.
She's an unscrupulous generous man.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dummel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a more southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a happy welcome to life, which is absolutely important!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly current: "In this piece it is about prejudices and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the inhabitants of New York didn't want them.
They are the same topics, and they are as powerful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirls who joined the IS were killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British girls who left London last year to join the IS, died reports in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family experienced her death a few weeks ago in Raqqa, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the group's country ball shop, reported ITV news on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died shortly after she had planned to leave the war - packed country and return to England.
"You can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and a warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - people stop ever making this decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other girls from East London entered a plane towards Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultanas family was informed that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and was widowed within less months.
Reid says Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of an election at Garland.
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since its nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, is of the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge to the High Court of Antonin Scalia.
On Thursday, Reid said during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to choose Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A speaker from Reid later said that he hadn't talked to Clinton yet if she would nominate Garland and speculate.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't worry about a new candidate.
Garland is the senior judge of the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked the Garland nomination, being lakas and assistants of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also found Donald Trump to be inappropriate for the president's office.
Treats wants a calendar for "Women and Men"
The trade magazine works with photographer David Bellemer to produce a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treads Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his Neck Storage differs from Old School-Playboys, since "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently he thinks it does the calendar too.
"We need to return to the display of timeless and classical nuisance, in which both women and men feel good and inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release about the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or personally at open casting auffraf in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish municipality calculated with mass flight
"He who does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases," says the Chairman of the Golden Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Kurdish municipality of Germany counts for a short time with tens of thousands of protection seekers fleeing from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even become "a few hundred thousand", according to the federation president Ali Toprak.
Due to the harsh conduct of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I count with tens of thousands, in the medium term with a few hundred thousand applicants for protection from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight minorities and democratic opposition," says the federation president Ali Toprak of the "world" from Friday.
Because the government had already moved over Kurdish high castles with fines months ago, 500,000 Kurds were on the run within Turkey.
Even secular and opposition ethnic Turks are added after the wounded pusch.
Many will want to start again in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey.
"It can't be that a state that takes refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The head of the association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alevitic cities.
In order to increase Erdogan’s output pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been cut off or expelled in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the federation demanded that the federal government "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters."
In Germany too, a "Hexenjagd" takes place against Erdogan critics.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German branch of the Golden Movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and Opposition.
The branding as a golden trailer destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Whoever does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases, also the Chemalists and Seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, president of the Golden-Near Foundation of Dialogue and Education, the "world".
As reported by the newspaper on numbers of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks have already presented the largest group of asylum-seekers in Germany, recognised for political persecution.
On Tuesday, June 30, this was 11,386 people and thus nearly 29 percent of all as eligible persons (39,625).
In this survey, there are no survivors of war, poverty, or insecurity.
Asylum-righted under the Basic Law are only politically, i.e. from the state side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The natives get nothing from the summer election with - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
2021 will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Swedish Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because more blood than so far is not going: summer holidays, heat and country day election - that's what it's all about.
The natives, who are to be persuaded by the voters, are on holiday.
Most holidayers who are in the country, on the road to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not local, so they must not choose the country day.
Practical problems arise: In the holidays there are helpers who hang the posters, blow up air balloons, spread flyers and tell the end of the voice to drive only hard.
Until September 4, 2016, the election day and the last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern once again has to let election struggles take place near the people.
The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.
And it's also something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
It is exciting how strong newing AFD is cut off and what remains to the end of the coalition day.
Sellering, 66 years of age and since 2008 chief of government, is making an almost ineffective election campaign, one looks away from its big posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and spreads a little with the people, just as it has already been done by his legendary chief predecessor Harald Ringstorff.
Otherwise, Seelering has received cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the flowering of the AFD.
Her refugee policy, her "We create this", has accelerated the rise of the lawmakers, which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenzo Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make the right choice at the wrong time.
She has invited Angela Merkel to major events twice; Merkel Bundestagskohlkriis is located in the northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalias, Berliners and Sachsen there than Mecklenburgers and vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal countries," said Vincent Kokert, secretary-general of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it also hurt no one from other corners of Germany to hear Angela Merkel once.
On the other hand, the Northeast-CDU largely ignores the usual election stand on markets and in front of shopping centers with sunscreens and air balloons.
That, according to Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noted that on the ground, it has to work hard to find a thread for people again.
You go like the left, the SPD, the green: you hardly exist in the countryside.
However, the council of the CDU-Whalkämper Kokert to his co-rapporteur is also curious: "They must go where it hurts, that is where the people are: Villages, Golden Weddings, every birthday must be used."
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD into a particularly committed election struggle.
In surveys, the Social Democrats last had 22 percent behind the CDU (25) and only shortly before the AFD (19).
At the 2011 election, the SPD had still clear with 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, should create the leap in the country day.
They make a modern gift from the holiday-notch and put their choice much into the Internet.
"On-line election campaign," it is called the country president Claudia Müller.
On the other hand, green voters are looking for a trace of local voters among the holidayers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is sailing right through the Mecklenburg lake with a houseboat and still finds it beautiful.
Her impression: "Walk holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is no punishment".
B27-Sanization: Hospitals suffer from constipation
At the speed with which the B 27 is repaired, there is nothing to melt.
For those responsible for the construction work that starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends only by 20 a.m., there is half a lobby.
"They've done everything pretty bad," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet Tank.
That's a super team.
There's no delay either.
At the beginning of the week, the construction site was able to be planned to the south until the end of October.
It is also promised to meet those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of relief services.
Since the construction site has been moved to the south on Monday and also the closure of Aspergstraße has been lifted in Offerdingen and thus the connection to Rottenburg has been restored, the traffic situation has relaxed within the town.
The citizens can now go back to the side of the B 27 from above.
It seems to be going down the road.
"There were partly significant complaints," says the Deputy Chief Officer Florian King responsible for the traffic management of the repair.
The inhabitants of Bachsatstagstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because they were looking for many highways and were more familiar with their navi than the description.
What led to some rents in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not complied with, the community called for the measuring vehicle from Mössingen to be strengthened.
"There were significant exceedances," says King, who himself was on the scene to investigate the situation.
There have already been two to three liters per minute.
The fastest was on the way in the tempo-30 zone with 77 hours.
Since the construction site has moved on, however, it has been quieter.
For business people at B 27, it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.
Businessmen can't look in the cards.
But that the B 27-sanctioning has led to revenue cuts in them, lets anyone who is asked to see it.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Anyone who has less to do with the "end customers" so produced for other companies, for which the repair has little effect.
Also at the Maier Autohaus, Thomas Sulz speaks of a "highest slight decline", but also suggests that "the current knowledge is missing".
The locals are most strongly affected along the road.
J. Albert Gohner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
That is already a threat to existence.
Not just him, but all the guesthouses "has hit it."
The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.
We must be happy about every euro turnover.
It refers to "over 50 per cent".
The road-sensation has "rejected its operation for two years".
Half of his employees had to be released.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been released, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, Government President Jörg Schmidt asked whether there could be a financial compensation, with the indication that the guesthouse would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at B 27. Now it would also have to bear the disadvantages arising from the restoration.
Gohner knows other country circles, where something more generous has been handled.
In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his guesthouse will continue to exist.
Finally, the family business has been established here since 1715, referring to the long history.
The other tribal guest is now less often seen because of the complicated traffic management, he can understand.
If you can't walk out, it's nice elsewhere.
The return of his family client to the end of the repair work has no doubt about it.
Despite the BSE and bird flu crises, Gohner maintains the impact of the B 27 construction works on his knowledge of the biggest crisis that has experienced his hospitality in his long history.
Six months of construction, this is already brutal.
In the name of the fight against terrorism, laws are constantly being written down.
After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does a state of torture have to do with terrorism?
And what does the coalition partner say about all that?
Thomas de Maizière gives the conciliator.
All his proposals were "politically acceptable" to the coalition partner," says the Federal Minister of Home Affairs in his presentation of his new security package.
They don't overburden anyone.
Other, continuing points would first be discussed within the parties.
I'm also involved in this.
However, as the interior minister, he was placed in results and in a "detectable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière has allowed some time before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they are now far more extensive.
Some are already known, announced, pointed out: the fact that a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
Nor is it the fact that Germany has to implement several EU missions on aviation data and arms law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is not surprising either.
In part, de Maizière starts a second run for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: He wants to put in punishment sympathy for terrorist groups and the Dishhadists with dual citizenship to the German passport.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man cleans up.
Nevertheless, he considers this to be acceptable and does not ask for anything that the coalition partner does not have any chance.
A few new ideas also present de Maizière.
They have it in part: it plans rapid procedures for removals and more possibilities to arrest people before removal.
Refugees who are being taken to the country should first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
In the case of tortures for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than they have done - for example, commit crimes or throw away their papers deliberately in order to obscure their identity.
Some of these are political and legal.
Some are still unsolicited and leave questions open.
And at some points, for example, in the treatment of the patient, the question is, What does it actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But it can't be said in Abrede that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
Moreover, in view of the high numbers of refugees, many people were concerned about security.
And things that the people were deeply occupied were now not allowed to grow even in election times.
Internal security is enormously focused.
Only the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The insurance is big.
And yes, there are election struggles.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in favour of internal security.
In the past few days, there has been a rise between the two parties.
It is only a bitter dispute over the provisions of the Federal Police, then about a collection of security policy ideas by some Union Interior Ministers, in which the residents also demand a Burka ban and a return from the dual citizenship.
De Maizière also strives here for a comfortable tone.
He didn't hold anything from a double pass.
We have released the debate in Germany.
You need to open it again, don't make sense.
And in a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is a constitutional party at all corners and whether it is actually "replaceable" for the coalition partner, it must only be shown.
It's a few things that can make a difference.
But the SPD is also currently trying to profile internal security on the topic.
Part-Chairman Sigmar Gabriel is only alert to speak and says, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security".
There's still people's cars coming through.
Despite diesel candals, delivery rates are rising worldwide.
But it doesn't run all the markets.
In the rear-facing there is a vertebral around a term.
Volkswagen starts with the deliveries of carriers in the second half of the year.
Europe's largest autobuilder can still have a plus in the course of the past year despite its many brands and some well-running markets.
But in July, the VW core brand weakened, especially in Western Europe, and thus charged the total sales again, as reported by the company mentioned in Dax.
In July, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year.
Only in Western Europe, after China's second largest market, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In the domestic market Germany, the deliveries fell by almost one sixth.
The sales manager Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July mainly to less than two sales days in Europe.
In some core markets, there has also been "changed economic framework conditions" where there has been a retention of purchases.
In addition to the situation surrounding Turkey's pouting attempt, a speaker explained the British vote on the EU's withdrawal.
In the United States, where the gas business was first escalated, there is also a minus to book.
Large support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected house brand of the Lower Saxonys is still more flammable by the diesel canal: after the first seven months, only one delivery minus 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.
From January to July, Group Sales Manager Fred Kappler was able to present a further sale plus.
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered cars at this time, 5,904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated with a software exhaust test.
In Germany alone, VW calls for about 2.5 million cars to be refurbished in the workshops.
During the refurbishment, the VW confirmed that the refurbishment of the cars had no negative effects.
After the refurbishment of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
After the refurbishment, the autobuilder presents the customer with a "guarantee-like" certificate, but does not speak of a "guarantee", as it was called on Friday in corporate circles.
The reason was legal flaws.
The "focus" had reported that Volkswagen provided its German customers with a guarantee for refurbished diesel models.
This had been confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.
"The VW has the task of fully fulfilling the tasks of my investigation commission and the KBA."
"Deviations are not accepted," said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.
The VW has accepted the guarantee that no deterioration occurs in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after the refurbishment and that all vehicle type-approval values remain unchanged.
Volkswagen himself does not use the term "guarantee" as it was called in corporate circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers come to a workshop with motor damage, for example, half a year after the refurbishment - and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the interest of customers, it is important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust canal, as it has been said.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee requires rich savings in the future - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank Chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "There are only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on giro or day money accounts".
The German Banks federation speaks of a single case and does not see any sign of it: Normal savers should "not be afraid to pay for their savings penalty".
If banks have to pay money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay 0.4 percent of their fines.
This fee is charged by the Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September by private and company customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros to giro or day money accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 costs 400 euros a year in the future," said Paul.
He has been covering 40 million euros in space, which one day could be cut off from the other and which he could not use.
"They are on my central bank account and cost 0.4 percent," said the bank manager.
"I can't spend EUR 4000 for every million."
He will now report the costs according to the polluter principle.
The money would be too dangerous: "I've already experienced four accidents, I don't like the fifth!" said the Banking Board.
Most customers would understand and switch to other forms of investment.
Only a few walked away to other banks.
The Bayern Association of Societies stated: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy rate causes considerable costs to all banks".
It is not possible to carry it alone, "permanently in business".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
The Thuringian People's and Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land, with its tax bank affiliates, had made three million euro deposits.
Michael Kemmer, head of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to pay flat-rate payments for deposits, which means that competition in Germany is too strong among banks and savings".
A banker said there is "a client who is more equipped with the property at the Tegernsee".
"This can be a problem for a small bank," if they keep money free of charge.
The Gmund Association Bank, founded in 1911, has branch offices in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
In the region, famous actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live.
The association Bayern "is currently not known to any other banks that calculate an exposure allowance for deposits of private customers," said the speaker Ernst.
The president of the German People's Banks and Raiffeisen Banks Association (BVR), Uwe Hröhlich, said at the end of June: "The threshold to go negative towards the private customer is very, very high".
Competition was tough, and it threatened to move from investors to competition.
Customers in Germany will not be allowed to do so in the widest sense.
Destination Plates: Who actually buys soundplates?
Single men of middle age love records.
Before you go to the comment section to pass it under the pseudonym NotAllUnlike MenMiddlers Aged with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the very promised resurrection of soundplates is not due to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a plate are expected to be between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a dog by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older plate buyers keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But do the results of YouGov agree?
If this blog were a news report on TV, I would follow the camera, while I'm running in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and wild stuttering, before I stand, holding my hands and saying something decisive like, "So let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at that.
Even if the heart of Sohos slowly integrates into its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a hand-made fantastic plate specialty business.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to estimate their age and humility by observing.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records (data number: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably about 20), is a day long due to a meeting in London and goes through the business to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I appreciate it," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These billboards, shown above (he sent me the snapshot via e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.
The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his income available: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and once again to buy items he sold when he was young and mature.
"Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably too young to buy them for me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy the plates are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
This is my cargo.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets meet on the YouTube profile.
However, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media scene, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records again.
From the talks that I have taken, people have usually left their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
This would explain the tree to the followers of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of plates?
It only takes a few seconds in a business like phoneica to recognize that record business offers a peaceful community of equals.
According to Wez, some of the older customers were attacked by the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of trusted record holes, from items that call for happy youth training.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of an empty or the possession of material owners as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
It's like a collector with me, and I think it's like a lot of people.
It's a simple way to deal spiritually.
"We're like their social workers!" one employee flees from a record stack.
An ICM survey in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month had not yet heard it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, while I am blaring through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at the Sounds of the Universe (Data Number: Three Men Middle Ages), has noticed a "trophena aspect" of the Revival.
"Someone came in here just recently and said, "I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a radiohead dial so I can put it in the store," he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-related, less musical.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're younger people, not older people, who just come in slowly.
Fop, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the sound board, has a more colorful audience than I do.
There are couples around the 70, tourists who take pictures, teenage boys and women middle ages.
Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts' latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz is draining from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity with the customers.
None of them looks lonely, but nurturing mental traumas are hard to determine when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.
She's more like a sheep's eyebrows than a big shop.
She doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of plates is..." she drives off with a beloved sucker.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I was presenting the appearance of the Jeans-Hotpants, I observed a group of young teenagers who grouped themselves for a moment around Polaroid Cameras before a father and his daughter pretended to buy a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at it - perhaps because they're just decorative, some as far up as it's impossible to touch it.
It's pure plate art.
But given that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depth of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most of it on luxury items like records.
Even if my research has shown that the results of YouGov are in agreement, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers, who exist in reality, record shops and online forums.
These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.
They spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the bumps through the plate shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through the plates, while they miss the dazzling view of a mysterious, 30-year-old false moderator who does not touch on the shoulders of ignorant men of middle age.
The greenlandhai is the longest live vertebrate - video report
Scientists say that Greenland hai has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who investigates Haie, says that the record was in a female, from which it is estimated that it is between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French Court of Justice rejects tenders on the abbreviation of transactions in the jungle refugee camps
A French court has rejected an offer from the authorities in Calais to bring down dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
In a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be competent, that 72 provisional transactions should be brought down in which persons within the camp sold goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, offer hairdresser services or tea for 50 cents (40 Pence) or simply meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
Prefecture Calais argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that there would be a risk of fire and health.
Humanitarian groups told the Court that business and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the State-supported association and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also argued that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the designation of persons carrying out the 72 temporary business, but argued that the concerns of Calais's prefecture were "absolutely legislative."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the descent was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated in a non-profit manner and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matters for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to celebrate the Kids' Cafe.
In a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the conclusion "would be a disaster for these children, of whom the last eight years are."
The two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrant estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in Newcomers during the summer.
Despite Olympia's disappointment: Martin remains belligerent
Despite his disappointing performance in the Olympics, Radprofi Tony Martin does not want to be undermined.
"I keep the WM in sight, remain confident and fight again," the 31-year-old wrote on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro on Facebook.
He doesn't have a statement for his miserable 12th place at the sugar hut.
"I find it really hard to comment on yesterday's time," Martin said.
He had to analyze in silence what reasons he had led to the debacle.
In October in Qatar, Martin wanted to fight for the title.
"I'll look at everything exactly that we've changed lately."
"It also counts my position," wrote the three-time World Cup winner who lost more than three minutes on Wednesday at 54.5 km on the Olympics Fabian Cancelellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennisprofi Siegemund missing semifinals
Laura Siegemund's quest for victory ended in Rio's quarter final: The world ranking 32rd from Metzingen missed a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-No.
34) the semifinal of the Olympic tennis tournament is clear.
Siegemund, which was charged with back problems, was only able to pass through its impact once and without force in comparison to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, Angelique Kerber (Kiel/Nr. 2) still had the chance to jump into the rounds.
The Australian Open Winner met British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis pro, Tommy Haas had won a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB-starters at the fourth final of summer games had been there for the last time in 1992.
Never again was a German duo in an Olympic single-halb final.
Group rises at startup for live video games transmissions
Other people to watch playing video games is a giant trend - it also wants to benefit Microsoft.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam that specializes in this hobby.
As much money is available for the takeover, Microsoft did not share on Thursday.
Beam started with his offer only in January and has already more than 100,000 users.
You can look at others while playing, but also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions and confront enemies and provide equipment.
The game activity Blizzard starts a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sport.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook will help.
The advertising industry is already stopping.
The employees of the start-up, which has its seat so far in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, are turning to Microsoft headquarters in the California Redmond, as Beam co-founder and Chief Matt Salsamendi announced.
Therefore, the acquisition should not change anything for the customers.
Beam, according to Microsoft, is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was purchased in 2014 by the Amazon Online Dealer - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is part of the Google Mother Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's breeders have to adjust to the next generation of speedometers: in various federal countries, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested, which are particularly effective in transporting time-consumers.
The futuristic effective strengthening trailer of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, to focus on accidents where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, there is often no necessary infrastructure at motorway buildings or to repair bridges with temporary Tempolimit to ensure that the speed limit is respected with a stationary flasher.
However, a permanent mobile building can be too dangerous or burdensome.
The Enforcement Trailer is autarch: His battery keeps at an uninterrupted measurement operation for five days, the case data will be transmitted over a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can be recorded simultaneously over several tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as travel bans according to time, driving lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In high-risk mode, you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer coupling.
In order not to be simply peeled, it is reduced in the measuring operation, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and in the rest of the way, even in a more succulent outer coat.
A built-in alarm system is also intended to protect the flasher from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested according to Vitronic's data in various federal countries and is currently also used.
Foreign authorities are also bluffing with the new technology: Recently France has ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
UK holds silver in the 7th Rugby after Fiji holds Masterclass Gold
The impressive performance of the UK at the 7th Rugby at the end of Thursday evening came to an abrupt stop at the last hut in the form of Fiji, when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side stepping, back, line run and rough force to win gold - its first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was crushed by the not too bad comfort prize of the silver medal - the fourth of Britain on this day - and they were able to be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear downfall of the boxes, 7-5 in the semifinal on the same day could fall on them in the final.
But regardless of this form, Fiji would have hit a 15-man team in best shape.
It could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Brit will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji Chief Coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a hard way behind it.
Eight years ago, they lost every game at Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.
There's only one thing they lost.
This sleep is going to hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji began wonderfully and let the GBs attack off the pass.
It felt like you were running a bus for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co.. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Colinisau crossed the corner.
With four more minutes of playing time Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he turned.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A great tack of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leon Nakarawa to reach a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua set up a touchdown in the right corner and stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the resume and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovou was hit by other weak hackings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a door.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental changes for half-time and closed the Fijian loops...for four minutes, which was good for the first half-time conditions until Joshua Tuisova passed through a brilliant mid-play by Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went on for a long time in favour of the southern islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the tribune.
It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fiji.
Mata Viliame put the i-tubfels together with another attempt in the last seconds.
The pfiff dissipated, the Fiji hugged and GB looked devastatingly beating in the grass.
Earlier that day, Fiji had won Japan in the semifinal with 20-5 and Britain forced South Africa into a short semifinal match from the race - the UK conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the box in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the line with an impressive footwork and reached a door under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant later tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside Team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the coach's cancer to victory
There won't be any more emotional gold than these games and that's what it means.
From the first round to the last, 220 hard hives that entered history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though there were only the two who were sitting on the row, there were three voices on the boat. The echo of Coach Robin Williams, was all the same when they sang to the second Olympic gold in the twin without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports who put such a scale.
Her domination was absolute, however, her 39th unbeatable use, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who wander over the surface with the elegance of the women, which does not fully reflect the kind of triumph.
Behind every gold in the mine is a battalion of volunteers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and it was no one more helpful than the trainer who did not know if he would survive this day than cancer was diagnosed with him.
Like he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable, and they did.
If you don't, he spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes a little of the view.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The Trio was lucky that he was treated at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, could begin what the breakup was to a minimum, if under such circumstances the right idea is at all.
I needed money, so I had to get better again soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough.
It's just beginning.
Screaming is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.
In the immediate victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking more than anything and trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was the main man in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a position in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. This may be something extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much it means to me how much Helen and I have worked as well as Robin.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so a massive thanks goes to him. He's the best coach in the world.
I wouldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not maintain.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to lock up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught at the moment.
Helen called "keep in the process, stay in the process".
It is really important not to get involved.
We had a good start, and at the same time, we weren't about to do something great.
We didn't want a fire work today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, what we did.
The couple will take a period of time for a year before making decisions about their future.
Glover has to appear next week at a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to understand that I was an Olympic winner.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
That feels so much better," she said.
31 years of oral care for clarity
The manager of the Association of Water Purposes "Vietensteingruppe", Ruppert Goller, goes to rest.
The association is considered "obligatory" throughout Bavaria.
A small freckle drink water supply association as a model for the large water producers.
So it was in the original tone some time ago in a contribution to the Bavarian radio.
A few years later, the water forum of the government of sub-franches honored the association of purposes.
The work of the Veitensteinggroup is considered "bayernwide" as voracious.
Behind all of this is Rupert Goller, who was 31 years in the Association of Employees, 28 of whom were managers.
Now he was adopted in retirement at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of the Veittensteingruppe with its seat in Kottendorf, the municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic metres of water each year and provides 32 places and wells with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
For other cities and municipalities there are water delivery contracts.
The current president, Breitbrunn's Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed Water Guard in 1985 and was appointed manager of the Association in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and they ranged from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, budget planning, charging fees and contributions to emergency investments on weekends," the chairman said.
As an outstanding event, it called for the introduction and adoption of the new sources (1994), land purchases in the area of new sources (1998) and compensation for farmers, the refurbishment of the high vessels (1999), the re-establishment of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipelines.
There has been no stopover and innovations have been made again and again, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her Laudatio, she praised Goller’s faithful, reliable and correct service for over 31 years.
He used a lot of heart blood for his water association and he lived the water association regularly, as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he was allowed to present the concept of success of the Veitenstein Group for nitrate reduction before the water forum of the Sub-France district.
For this he has received a great deal of recognition and praise.
Rupert Goller, on the other hand, praised Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best waterman and he was a faithful guy.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he referred to the construction of the well and the restructuring of the association.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use, however, were the tube fracture at the high tank at Kirchlauter on January 3.
Here, at minus 17 degrees, the whole night will have to work so that the villages can be provided with water.
The provision of Neubrunn has also been possible only once because you filled Pettstadt's high tank with hoses.
The management of the drinking water association was transferred to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who follows Rupert Goller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko opens up with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "They must have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease was recognized by her son, she believed she had to die.
In the meantime, the eight-year-old Tiago was well advanced and now learns privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: If I ask him something that is left for two years when I sing at the Milanes Scala, he remembers nothing," Netrebko said.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection to the bassbaritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship in Bartheide - Man shoots at life-threatening
A 35-year-old man shot his partner on Friday at 10.45 p.m. in a multifamily house in Bartheide (Kreis Stormarn) and killed her.
"The man himself called and told us to have shot his life companion," said one police spokesman.
The killer is on the run, he'll be arrested in public.
In the meantime, the United States, as Sven S. could be on the road.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, brown-burned and has a glazing.
In the meantime, the police published a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
In the meantime, the man wears a glove.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, so the police.
Whoever sees Sven S. is supposed to call 110.
The police are talking about a relationship.
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The competent police in Lübeck initially did not want to make any mention of the tather or the relationship between the killer and the victim; however, they confirmed that a man was killed.
"It's a murder crime."
"We don't say anymore at the moment," said a police spokesman in Lübeck.
According to the evidence, a special application command (SEK) was at the tatort.
Steel - Lighting for the German steel industry
The crisis-based and energy-intensive German steel industry remains offset by additional costs in millions.
Financial burdens that threatened the ecosystem industry are from the table.
It remains in the process of releasing the renewable energy supply from the so-called own-power plant in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "West German General newspaper" (WAZ, release).
"I am really glad that we were finally able to achieve this after two years of closer negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore first planned to ask the steel producers to put the gas out of the oven to produce electricity for their own consumption.
According to the German Association of Industry, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros a year.
Gabriel told WAZ that there is now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only if the generators are replaced in the steel works will an EEC deposit fall by 20 per cent.
But these will not be raised in the steel industry either.
The IG Metal welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on its own power generation.
This will largely determine the status quo of the previous regime.
The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry are of particular importance.
"In view of our campaign 'Stahl is the future', this is a first step."
"More must follow."
"There are also climate and employment objectives to be weighed in the reform of the emissions trade," explained IG Metal Chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and significant price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.
Last year, the situation continued to worsen as the world's largest producer country of China cast massive steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.
European producers in China are proposing price dumping.
During this spring, the situation was somewhat relaxed.
In order to demonstrate the effect of the suspended import duties on steel, the economic prospects in China have been brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry premium Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.
Last time, prices would have stagnated again.
The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Finally, Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude the closures of individual works.
At the end of 2015, about 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.
In July the German steel producers remained cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
They produced by 3.4 million tonnes of good six percent less crude steel than in the previous month, as announced by the Association of Steel on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantities produced now returned to each other in the second month.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been below the previous year's value by two percent.
In the coming months, the Association will be counting on an improved order situation with an increasing outbreak.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing does good for seniors
The song has accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: As a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher's studio she performed the field of music, and today the 78-year-olds sing in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a trial, she feels balanced, happy and all alive, she says.
In addition, she does something good to her health and mind.
Because Singing is from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with peers, says Hackler.
Through regular association, seniors can contact and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures often develop at an age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To speak and organize, to be able to leave each other and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of association".
Singing can be challenging in the positive sense, says Hackler.
Because seniors are training a deep and controlled breath.
Those who regularly ask for their lungs also do not get so quickly out of the shower every day.
Even if it's about getting the sound of the voice at the age, Singing is an optimal hobby.
On older people, Singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Community of Senior Organisations.
In the older generations, the common song had a much higher place value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, demented people themselves are characterized by long-lasting events.
In singing, the head is also required for a special performance, explains Lenz.
At the same time, concentrate on your own voice and on a prescribed rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Just older people who live alone practice not only to focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you experience by singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The feeling of self-esteem also grows through the singing in the choir.
To show myself: If I practice for a long time, I will be better and grow more than I am - this experience strengthens.
So there's plenty of reasons to start singing.
Whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent, advises Lenz.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes down?
Looking for the appropriate offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.
If someone from the acquaintance circle sings in a senior choir, you can just join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the audience in the area.
Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the congregation or to the head of the church.
Many elderly people are also found on the Internet.
Anyone who does not have access to the Internet can ask family, friends or neighbors for help in Internet research.
Whoever wants to sing should definitely join a choir, Hackler advises.
Singing is good for the soul and has some relief - this applies to every age.
Cats react more sensitive than cats on the steps of young animals
Biologists in Hannover have examined the effect of calling cats to adult animals.
To their surprise, the bride did not let the men cold either - however, they always behaved the same way to the women.
Female cats can detect the rate of recovery of cats at the mill of the small ones.
They respond ten percent faster to the sounds of cats, who are in great need, as scientists from the veterinary school and the medical school Hanover (MHHH) have come out.
Cater also reacts to the calls of cats - however, always the same.
"It is obvious that the acoustic differences between the mill of less and highly trained males are unattainable or not significant," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the team of researchers had already found that the length and height of the skating step differs with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight cats from the keeping of the MHH were observed.
They were designed to be called little ones who were taken out of the dumpster for three minutes and separated from their mothers and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screaming of stronger raised cats.
The researchers consider their results to be strong despite the low sample.
"All women, even those who had not yet had their own upbringing, responded differently to the cry," Konerding said.
They turned more quickly to the speaker when this call of the most honored cats played.
This ability may be born or develop with the gender line.
"It was a surprise that the men had reacted at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have studied the reactions of women and men to baby noises several times in humans.
Some studies also showed that women responded more sensitively to infants, whether they were already mothers or not, according to biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski grabs with "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant was issued against the former Hakan Sükür football star.
He is proposed to be a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the Putsch experiment, an important football game again takes place in Turkey.
Before the duel of the Erzrivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clearly stated: "Business as usual".
As soon as the exception was suspended after the attempt to reverse the situation in July, the government assessed that the day-to-day situation of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
However, this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of preacher Fethullah Gulen, who is responsible for the attempt.
It is also not held in front of the football.
Against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür, the Public Prosecutor issued a warrant.
Thus, the sugar that lives in America is now proposed to be a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür will be followers of the preacher Fethullah Gulen, who will be made responsible by the president of the state Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the attempt.
Although the condition of the first 90 days is still restricted until October, it actually affects the lives of most Turks as well as no effects.
The night 'Democracy Watches' in public places throughout the country explained Erdogan on Wednesday for the end.
Sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdogans.
In particular, fans of the Labour Club are traditionally not among the president's friends.
But what happens to the great crowd of Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military puppies.
Even the fans agree - no matter whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or possession.
With Pokalsieger "Gala" it will come back to Lukas Podolski in particular.
In the past season, the Colognen demonstrated its sporting value: With 17 towers and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first playtime as topscorer of his association.
In the final match against Fenerbahce, he achieved the 1:0 victory match.
The newspaper "Fanatik" cheered him: "He was the best in the place."
He completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team the podium.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season for the recordmaster found a comfortable conclusion.
After the background K.o in the Champions League, the "Lows" were separated early in Europe.
In the Super Lig it is only about six.
The season wasn't good.
The Pokal was the only way to win something.
"That's what we did and that's the most important thing," said Podolski.
For Master Besiktas the game year was better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the basis for the title 14.
That is also why the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31st year.
Only Gomez, who was under contract with AC Florence and was seconded to Besiktas, had announced after the attempt not to return because of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," the "Kicker" club boss Fikret Orman quoted the magazine.
However, the storms had to be prepared to refuse to pay around one third of its annual salary estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman made it clear: "We cannot pay its worth at Florence".
Despite Doping: These athletes still have medals at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already closed twice because of dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblowerin Julia Stepanowa must not start in Rio.
Other transferred lightweight athletes can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals.
The Doping theme remains as before the battle lines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who, after a Doping-Spere, had just claimed her right to start the games, was unscrupulous and unscrupulous at her start (100 meters breast).
There was a scurrile scenario: With a smile set up, she was still proud in the hall and provoked with her performance.
When it was found that they were not going to get gold, the audience broke out into a jubilee storm.
However, there are still many other athletes who, despite Doping's past, start out at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Here's an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-staff/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in light athletics.
He was already closed twice due to dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since its ban, the 2004 Olympic champion and former world champion have been running even faster than before, it is over 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the biggest challenge of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-st-staff/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic winner and seven-time world champion had to take a six-month suspension in 2010, after being proven to be taking the pain agent oxycodon.
She had severe dental pain after surgery, defended her 29-year-olds.
Sandra Perkovic (Discus/Croatia): In 2011, the 2012 Olympic winner, the 2013 World Championship, and the 2010-2016 European Championship were tested positively on the banned methylhexamine stimulant.
Perkovic contests the important intake and has been shut down for six months.
The four largest posters this year go to the account of the great gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-staff/USA): The Beijing Olympic winner and two-time world champion over 400 m, was positively tested in 2010 and was suspended for 21 months.
A resource for penis enlargement was responsible, appreciated merritt.
This year, the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 m of the fastest man in the world.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerwarf, Belarus): Not many medals have been recognized after all.
Tichon lost his WM title nine years later, after being found with Testosterone-Doping.
Meanwhile, the 40-year-old also had to give up Olympia silver in 2004 because of steroid dopings and the EM title 2006 because of testosterone misuse.
He also received a bronze medal from the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgment of the International Court of Sport CAS.
At 80.04 m it is located on rank two of the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km) Go, China: The World Recorder and Goldfavoritin was tested positively in May, but may still start in Rio.
In the 29-year-old World Master, evidence of the intake of a prohibited food supplement was found, the barrier of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA fell mild and expired on 13 July.
Bombenterror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several deaths
The Austrian message in Thailand was in contact with the woman, the speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, said on Friday morning.
She has suffered from sneezing and has been treated in the hospital, but she has already been able to leave it.
Her home trip planned for the beginning of September.
Whether the further explosions on the island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens, it is not clear at all.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been in constant contact with the local authorities, as quickly as possible.
Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, was first exploded on Thursday night in a quarter of a century.
According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including Austrians, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two explosions again went up, and another man was killed, according to the authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported in the morning by Phuket.
At the detonation near the beach of Patong, a taxi driver was injured after police reports.
In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing a urban employee.
According to the authorities in a flowering area before the coast police district, the rate of explosion has gone into the air.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast were requested by several injured.
You go out of a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it's called.
"The Bomb Nights bear the same manuscript," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists.
"We assume it's a coordinated attack."
It is too early to comment on possible motives - but it is probably about the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern in the attacks that is typical of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
On the other hand, the Thai police stated that the Attents did not stand in connection with the Islamic rebellion or with international terrorism.
"This is only local Saturdays that are limited to limited areas and provinces," said a speaker in Bangkok.
Instead, it seems that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta were put in place.
In the past days, the authorities would have received classified information on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however, they had not been informed about the exact time and places.
Let's see what group is behind the attack.
The police urged their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand, there are increasingly smaller bombings, but they are usually not against tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace that was used over years by King Bhumibol Aduladej of Thailand.
Following the current bombings, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be followed.
High safety risk (safety level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and the environment.
After conflicts between security forces and Muslim populations, no necessary travel will be made in these provinces.
Increased safety risk (safety level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the militaryjunta.
This has had a major impact on the military in the coming years.
Junta-Chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country was moving towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The military junta, which had taken power after a phase of bloody unrest in 2014, has the advantage of having the Kingdom back to stability and order.
However, it has not been able to get the Muslim rebellion in the grip of the military, which has been raging in the southernmost part of the country for years.
More than 6,500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok in an attack on a popular Hindu screen - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest blow of the recent history of the country.
The right "Identifying movement" has been entered into the vis-à-vis the Federal Constitutional Protection Office.
According to several country offices, the constitutional defenders in the feds also put the group under observation.
"We see at the 'Identifying movement' points of reference for efforts against the liberal democratic fundamental order," said author Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Presse-Agenture in Berlin.
In this way, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are excommunicated in an extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "Identifying movement" is a group with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.
It turns against "Multicultural Way", "uncontrolled mass migration" and the "lost identity of its own by overcoming".
Constitutionalists in nine federal countries - Bremen, Bayern, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - already observe the "identitaries".
Maaßen said that his authority had agreed closely with the country's officials in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identifying movement' try to pick up their target group where it is," said the Chief of Constitutional Protection.
In general, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often with poppy music.
That's what Islamists do, as well as right-wing extremists.
This is not significant advertising for your own business.
The propaganda should address people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Last time, it had reported from several federal countries on contacts of "identitiaries" with AFD politicians.
Maesen said he didn't have any clues.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point.
It should be noted whether the party concerned - in this case, the AFD - changes its target direction by certain persons who are extremist and thus become extremist.
It is therefore crucial that such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the significant increase in legal offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees, he would not speak of new right terrorism in this regard.
But in recent years we have found that there can be legal terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freelance Group.
It may be clear that other right-wing terrorist groups or minority groups are planning attacks on asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks on other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a German or European governance of legal terrorism is not detectable.
The previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks.
Concernedly, measures were expressed that there were many violations on the account of people who were not previously in the right scene.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects were previously not known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene.
"Many people have thus committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with legal extremists who may have been politically independent or chose, for example, a CDU, SPD or a left, but then radicalised by a right-wing mood."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes the internet hit
The Olympics or world record do not always determine the battle lines at the Olympics.
This shows the courageous performance of Robel Kiros had in the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV images.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In the social networks, Habte became a virtual internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old ends up with a 48-second remainder of his pre-exchange and creates the 59th place of 59 beginners.
But it was rather his not just sports figure that drew the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian was granted a special starting right from the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimmers in under-represented countries known.
As most athletes are running in Ethiopia, I just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Hadte is ready for the big race.
Soon the first peaks made the rounds.
Some media called him a "robel der Wal".
The English Boulevard leaf "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him.
His time, he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters freestyle, did not play a role there.
Compared with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's career was a media focus.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea when he had to arrive alone in a prelude over 100 meters of freestyle.
In French, Moussambani was then inflamed.
At the time, the 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

An open industrial ceiling in DTLA gets a cozy makeover
We celebrate the 90th birthday of the Central Library of L.A. with - what else? - a new book
Geretsried - The owner of a shop in the new place has been stolen.
According to the police, the 67-year-old manager left his business on Monday at 5.30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When they returned the next morning at 8.15 p.m., they had disappeared from the box about 250 euros.
No traces of the actor could be found.
No video surveillance is available either.
Trump doesn't see the threat of election.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump talks about a election event in Florida.
If there's nothing going to happen with the choice of the US president, Donald Trump already has an alternative.
He'll go on a vacation.
Donald Trump loses the U.S. presidential election in November, it would be relatively equal to him: "At last it will either hit, or I have a very, very beautiful, long holiday," said the Republican candidate in a phone interview with the U.S. television channel CNBC.
If it's not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, then that's all right, Trump said.
He referred to US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, as the founder of the terrorist militia of the Islamic State (IS).
In his party, more and more resistance has been formed.
Post rises in trade with electric transporters
An electric vehicle of the German Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the danger is obviously great.
The post plans to sell their electric vehicle StreetScooter as well.
In short, the Group wants to start trading with the carrier.
The post wants to offer its electric transporters from next year also on the free car market.
"We want to get into the sale to third parties," said a post speaker on Friday.
The company has been examining for months whether to sell their own developed StreetScooter, with the letters and packages, also to other companies.
Post board Jürgen Gerdes had said that there are always requests, for example by artisans.
According to information provided by the news magazine "The Mirror" the Bonner Group will soon enter the mass production of vehicles.
The company plans the construction of up to 10,000 cars per year and layer in its own factory.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and target a complete shift to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're changing the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on the streets of Germany since 2014.
GfK's leadership goes down to disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK replaces its chief Matthias Hartmann.
The retreats came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK pointed out that the chair of Management Director Matthias Hartmann will be much more uncertain as long as the success promised by him remains.
Turbulence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After a further disappointing number of businesses and the downturn in corporate governance, the world number five of the industry is ahead of a personal start.
The GfK Chief of Staff wants to leave the company by the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, is already taking effect on 12 September from the Supervisory Board.
As of 1 September, the management board took over the former board member Gerhard Hausruckinger, the company informed him.
He will officially take over the function of a "presidency speaker" until a successor has been found for Hartmann.
As a basis for retirement, the company called "different views" the long-term business policy orientation.
Details did not want to name a business speaker on Friday.
If the market research company is to be led in the future, it is still unclear.
In investor circles it was on Friday that the shareholders were finally disappointed by the continuing success of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK point since 2011.
"But the fruits of the restructuring are not yet visible after 5 years," it said.
In view of the recent bad GfK business figures, each shareholder will be at some point uneasy.
"If that were the case with BMW, it would also do the Quadts," he said.
In the second quarter of 2016, the company could not have stopped its lost journey even after a setback in the previous quarter.
With EUR 361.2 million, turnover was 6.1 per cent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
With regard to the first half of the year, sales dropped by 3.4 per cent with 721.2 million euros.
The profit in the second quarter has mainly weighed on the company's low value because of its difficult economic situation.
The company securities of 139 million euros that became necessary in the Consumer Experience business sector protected the group under the strike a loss of 148.2 million euros.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK produced another 19.7 million Group Wins.
Accidents - Bus spreads in wormholes in graves: Eight injured
On Thursday in Krummörn (Landkreis Aurich), eight people were injured in an accident involving 43 senior passengers.
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, the police reported.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to avoid an overload that was part of the road.
The bus came to the right of the street and ran into a grave, as a spokesperson of the Aurich/Wittmund police reported.
"Because of the situation of the bus, the people could not leave the bus alone," she said.
The firefight frees the inmates.
Six rescue cars and a notary car came to the crash site on the road 2.
The uninjured travelers were brought back to the Krummörner district of Pewsum from a line bus.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The charges per cubic meter of discharge shall be as from 1 October 2016 for the area of the discharge facility Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkall 3.44 instead of 2.10 Euro; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lop 3,36 Euro (up to 2.26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3.64 Euro (up to 2.18 Euro).
The plant in Azendorf will increase the discharge fee at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After an overcalculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the budget was approved by the Kulbach Land Council, it was found that cover was being provided for these sewage facilities.
The Kasendorf market is obliged, on the basis of legal grounds, to operate the facilities in a cost-effective manner.
As of 1 October 2016, the citizens, as well as the commercial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkhal, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to get deeper into the money box.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 per cent.
As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the board, a recalculation of the fees for the disposal facilities of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, overcovers from the previous calculation period should also be offset.
The gravitational charge increases were justified by Schmidt’s fact that all three drainage systems are relatively small facilities with a very low drainage attack, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
For example, the low distribution base would have a serious impact on the cost of necessary repairs of several thousand euros.
In addition, the discharge of water in all three plants was slightly reduced.
Furthermore, in all three installations during the subsequent calculation period, due to their age, remedial and repair costs have been incurred to a significant extent.
The facility in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welschekal, Neudorf and Reuth, as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that in the waste water system, as a result of damage, the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced.
In the pump plant Welschenkal, the nearly 20-year-old support plants had to be taken over by reason and, at the tea-clearing plant, Lopp had to be excavated after almost 20 years of operation of the first clarifier, the clarifier seal was removed and an additional ventilation facility was built in order to meet the water law requirements in the future.
Schmidt: "To these extraordinary costs, the costs of care and maintenance were taken into account in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs that are still clearly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Stone houses made it clear that in the case of the low rainfall in the three installations, the costs for the operation and maintenance were "completely met".
In addition, Schmidt, the market community of large maintenance costs in the waste water plants has been excluded over the past 20 years.
The situation for these plants will continue to be precarious, in the view of stone houses, since it is not possible to extend the water supply area of the Friesenbachtal Association to these plants because it is a lack of facilities.
Bulgaria booked for the first time in 8 months inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria accounted for 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October, as positive 0.2% were booked.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was measured according to the CPI -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1,0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2 %.
In July 2016 a price increase was observed in the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine expectations (0.5%); health (0.1%).
The prices remained as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education unchanged.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticised as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to breeds.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million users a day to change the reality and to play with identities in a way that is already bound to absurdity.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be painted from a Roy Lichtenstein.
The filters are unmistakable, property-changing tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All wrongs have reached the public.
Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past, in which they were accused that the app Blackface would promote or white skin as a beauty ideal.
When this week some users proposed a filter that gave them sharps, false teeth, and exposed waves, some critics called it a racist character of Asians - "Gelb face".
They wondered whether these repeated disputes pointed to a greater problem that the company had diversity.
News and encouragement were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled the feature.
The company apologized: the filter was thought to be a tribute to anime characters and not a cartoon of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism remembered the filter of insulting clichés.
Others rejected the anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparpani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweet was widely distributed over the photos, wrote that the filter was "damaged and smooth."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the counter-translation of a very negative Asian character and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellowish face has been drawn into the derivative extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural barrier.
American culture seems to be developed in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.
And Snapchat's great audience of young people - who are different in race than their older opponents - could rather expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is damaging to a user, "it's so much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it was before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for media, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.
In an essay for the media and in a phone interview, she said that she believed racial disputes reflected a lack of diversity in Snapchat's settings.
Zhu criticized them for most of the white, only male leadership and ended their setup with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Neither do they have a different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left Snapchat unresponsibly unresponsible.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff and refers to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees, but according to a speaker, the company recently appointed a staff manager who focused on underrepresented population groups and internal integration efforts.
Zhu told her that she would close her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it's not OK."
Military management false ISIS secret service information, adopted by Congress Committee
Military members of the United States Central Command changed news service information to make a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than it would have permitted the actual state on the ground, a committee of inquiry of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, created by a task force of the Republican members of the Military Committee, the Secret Service Committee and the Defence Budget Committee, reports with great dissatisfaction among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported changes in their estimates of US efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, in short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Reporting service information, typically degenerated by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly showed a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it had allowed the actual state on the ground and were constantly more positive than analysis of other news services," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The management errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report shows detailed persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
Although there is no direct indication that government officials have given Obama instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts have seen themselves exposed to the pressure of their rules to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015 many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before the Congress were much more positive than the facts" the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military recovery of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigations, it is so clear," said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressor from Kansas, in an opinion.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the Central Command's tops changed the news service reports to lower the risk by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called the Task Force into their lives after they were taught that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports about the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations are ongoing.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are carried out by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the News Service Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an over-restricted process for the creation of ISIL news services and Iraqi security services," the High-level Democrat in the Committee, a member of the Adam B. Ship Representant House, announced in an opinion.
This process, according to Mr. Ship, "responseded the publication of news services reports", damaged morals among analysts and "gived too little space for differing opinions."
But Mr Ship and the Democrats indicated that they had not found any evidence of the White House's intervention with the Centcom analysts on a "certain political opinion".
The preliminary results of the congress' findings were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Inspector General of the Pentagon, which were recorded following complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a spokesperson for the Pentagon, stated in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on reports of the Congress, while the Inspector General's investigations were still ongoing.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have completely divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The investigations have feedback on the issue of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim currently made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
However, last year's accusations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic state reminds of doubts of more than ten years ago when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece of writing about how the then government under George W. Bush opposed the recommendations of many analysts just predicted a small group of occupations in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current report on the Islamic State.
Last year, the team on Mr. Hooker, according to government officials, found that, contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the group's financial situation, since these provisional refineries had been operating to sell oil on the black market.
However, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's former commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation in a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin went to rest in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel on the Central Command.
The USA wins fourth match in the women's field hockey, a showdown with the United Kingdom before
One day after she had shot three doors during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two doors for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that Americans won with 3-0.
Five doors in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said they couldn't remember ever having done that.
"I don't know." She said.
I'm not one of the people who keep their doors in memory.
However, she knows that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympics and are in the same group with the British in the first place that remain unbeatable after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last round of the game.
Both teams have already qualified for the fourth final, the game will decide which of the two teams in their group from six teams will each achieve the first and second seats.
The first place will lead the strong Dutch people a little longer out of the way that leads to the other group.
Whatever the game may go on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising turnout through their success story, four years after they landed at the past London Games in the last 12 places.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time in three years had a hockey match in her hands (their two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), when she was 16 years old, she became a US national player, the youngest in the history of the team.
She missed the Olympiad in 2008, as she could not qualify for the frame.
Then came the year 2012, in which everything for her and her team was shaking.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman and coach of the National Team, began to make things better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the workforce in London that we now have.
We've been able to completely bypass the rudder.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the door in the first half of the game with a back hand from the nearby area.
India had gone to the game without winning in the tournament, but the team showed a surprising turn and held the play level from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled in the middle and ran the ball into the door to give the Americans a 2-0 leadership.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the U.S. Torhüterin, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a door in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will it depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the middle of the line of the Olympic games, the Zen of the Trampoline
Wherever you are, as late as it is, it is the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and unmistakable, a fiercer strike between competition and pursuit.
It's as if the Olympic factk itself would be a burning rod, which is enriched by the armrests to swim to the tournament to triathlet.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the waiting line at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympics for the first time and a woman's warmth with mushrooms, could have been just under these famous names sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and well-being TV advertising if he was a swimmer, tournament or even a fan.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event at the same time.
Next to the center, partly in the shade are sports that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, bow shooting, Badminton, Taekwondo.
We'll always have the breast-swimming and let it rule for a long time.
But if I may modestly make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline race has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been so exciting for the past 16 years that many of those I had asked did not know it was a Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline race and had an athlete until 2012 that won it until the end.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for men and the Chinese and the Canadians for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medals from London this year.
The trampoline jump has a certain external charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than for the Olympics.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a ground-bound enthusiasm.
It has humoristic potential - the cardboard-like cider of its never-ending excitement - but also the grace of the tournament and dive, the two sports that combine it essentially.
The word "Trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "Trampoline."
Exciting winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet into the air and have to have a series of falling movements (drills, hooks and jumps) before they land on the feet.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympia programme after execution, difficulty level and "airtime".
Two-way athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will meet in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
In their quest for gold, medal hopers must move forward, faster, up and across, sometimes to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They not only pursue the finish line or the starting wall, but also another honitic goal in the television transmission: the world or the Olympic Code.
The goal is noble, wonderful, even fanatical - and it is enough to even touch a viewer to tears.
But it's also what I feel to myself when looking at these games as something tiring.
The trampoline offers a breath.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she's going off, apparently as hard as an astronaut, going up, then down, then struggling again.
There is also a competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It can be as Zen as competition in the Olympics only.
The women's qualifications and finals will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13 a.m. East Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13 a.m.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of a afternoon block on two days from 14 a.m.
In the middle of the Olympia Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general.
If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the indication and objectiveization of male athletes - as the American male tournaments have recently suggested in The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley is expecting his new fan community calling for air.
"A generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrants calling for political change in Ethiopia were opposed by the government.
Witnesses say that during the clash with the police, thousands of protestors were killed in the event of gunfighting.
Is Ethiopia just about to collapse?
In the last ten years, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid association of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But protests against the government have spread over the past few months, and more and more areas are spreading.
Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the Government's response was unmerciful.
Witnesses reported that policemen shot and killed thousands of unarmed demonstrators.
In the course of videos about the protests, probably from the last or early of this year, show how security people beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handle against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority now demands an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will even become more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa in Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorism outside the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.
His infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new pendant in Addis Ababa capital.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was all other than a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continually brought the repression by the government - opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents being effectively brought to silence.
Many were sent to exile or to prison, killed, or driven into the desert.
But that could change.
"If you oppress people and have no other options but to protest, it will break out," said Seyoum Teshome, a teacher in central thiopia.
The whole youth protests.
A generation protested.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the ground use to the attack on the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, the tensions rise along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this poignant, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo liberation front or the National Ogaden liberation front, which have been forced more or less in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and rearm themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of irritability are now exploding under the surface after years.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxyes that hide where they are staying.
Several young Ethiopians reported that they had gathered to protests.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since then, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia, have flourished in politics and economics, while taking advantage of the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flatlands.
But that also changes just now.
"We are coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in the territories of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is inextricably dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigers, who make up about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, in the secret services, in trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death at a non-public illness in 2012 for 17 years as Prime Minister of Ethiopia.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly inclined to observe early signs of discontent and to use special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively unexpected reasons to adopt the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigris region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy confidence in the security services controlled by the Tiger.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time that Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which, according to analysts, seemed to have been embroiled and subsequently stolen by the government.
During the following season, many Protestants were killed, even though they were less than in the last few months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new pendant train, as well as for their measurable progress in combating poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal mistrust of the Ethiopian government.
And it takes a dangerous form of ethnicity.
Last month Protestants attacked in Gondar, an amharic city, businesses run by Tiger, and the hate against the tiger is becoming more and more common in social media.
Analysts say that the protests bring the United States and other Western allies into a separate position.
The US government used Ethiopia as a basis for drone flights across neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it had closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his allies to collapse into an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin gratis migration."
Donald Trump declares his claim Obama has founded ISIS was "Sarkasmus"
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to dissipate the last controversy surrounding his campaign by stating that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founders" of the terrorist group of the Islamic State, not seriously meant.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the candidate for the presidency of the Republicans, whether it would be able to communicate clearly and understandablely with the American public.
It also brings his fellows who are trying to protect him during an eventful phase, in the own position, to have to explain statements he could not even have meant.
After making the adjudication at an election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump withdrew on the claim on Thursday and was in interviews to suggest that he really did not intend to show that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he felt the charge was entirely serious.
When the conservative radio moderator, Hugh Hewitt, wanted to help Mr. Trump to slow down his statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it.
The last storm of criticism is pushing Mr. Trump down, while he has tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling survey values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton spoke about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump again tried to return to this issue.
He warned on Twitter that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already submitted Sarkasmus to his defense.
At the end of July, he took strong criticism when he thought the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said, "Of course I thought it sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to move the language boundaries into politics and then to clean back to the need.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then, where appropriate, "clear" according to how the reaction is affected." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates.
But I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of tightening the tone for the presidential elections, Mr Trump has adopted an even more intense tone since his surveys have continued to decline.
A new survey of NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leading lead in the federal states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-on-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to have to apologize for his provocative statements, he often blames his critics for distorting his statements or misconception of his humor.
But while he is focusing his attention on the past few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have brought his loyal fellow soldiers into the uncomfortable situation to him, no matter how challenging his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent speakers, was able to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe what he says is legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked about Mr. Trump's statement whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
In this sense, it is true that in the presence of Obama ISIS, there was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them back-linkers, totally wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most Mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to expand by subscribing it to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
In front of the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and proposed to them to prepare for each of his words and to be taken up against him.
He promoted the "poor, evil" TV experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't!".
Some of the Democrats complained about Mr Trump's apology as just another proof that he was inappropriate for the presidency.
Once forced by the market, Café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shady café in Williamsburg, where one could only pay bar, which had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue Chargefront were forced.
Soap Cherie, the verb replaced in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals felt it was the last loss in a generous city.
The artist Molly Crabpple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is out and Verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is a change, then it's also a new one.
A renowned Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar light atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old café, the owner and manager of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.
When a customer offered to provide funds for a new outpost, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bags bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with spikes and cheese and there are garners such as capers and sauted mushrooms.
There are natural travel slippers.
The café no longer serves beer, so there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a constant stream of old tribal customers.
"Many old customers were also forced by Williamsburg's prices," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg earlier and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she was taken to Greenpoint, she would take the road.
After the verb had closed, she gave up the coffee pot for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was in the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even though on that day she ordered a blended Chai Tea instead of her usual Iced Coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been a long-standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the 2003 Verb.
He went there before the work and ordered the same thing unavoidably.
"I came in fours after seven, every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they're preparing my everything bag with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything bag with spikes, eggs and cheese.
Rodriguez said he had no interest in the fact that the soap business had taken over the old business.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb with the cold-rolled coffee of the café as a ingredient.
"I think we're still going to get on her offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints also accepted the café.
A new customer translated the food card into Polish and Rodriguez said he intended to expose it soon so that his new neighbors would feel welcome.
The site also has other advantages.
A local juice room wants to fill the frozen coffee in bottles and sell.
There is a chance that the café expands to a nearby building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a tribalist and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the local and ordering a new coffee like a homecoming felt.
"I had to smell it," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his accession to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt entered the Oval Office for lunch.
As a fine taste President Roosevelt had a weak for refined delicates of the Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland Water Shield Soup.
His menu on this day was somewhat modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato purée and as dessert a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Your husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans how they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes' last book "Chop Suey" was about the Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Ziegelman tells about life in a home at the Lower East Side from the food perspective in her book "97 Orchard".
Their latest collaboration, "A decent meal", which will appear on Tuesday in the Harper publisher, illustrates the story of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, fast-paced imbis in Flatiron District, which has been in business since the Börsencrash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, Truthahn ate potatoes and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered hackbraten, this couple found it appropriate to discuss the food in the era of the Great Depression.
"Reliable foods were very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was strawberries, liver cheese and beans.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something billiard that stretched the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinners.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
"It must have been in the stomach like a flower," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pastries were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" shows the ways with which the country was surrounded to be no longer the land of the Schlarapfen.
"It was a time when food for the Americans became a central, exciting topic," Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Similarly, the new budget diet was stressed: mysterious foods such as bread and casseroles became basic foods, the casserole as "wonderful way to re-evaluate food," said Ziegelman, since the kitchen could hide unspoilt ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which was the center of the American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury.
Own mixtures were tested as a calorie-rich and nutrient satisfaction took precedence over taste or even healthy cooking.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a court from this time, baked mushrooms with peanut butter.
"There was no popular addition to lunch," Coe says.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Groundnut butter and baked mushrooms do not match.
It was typical of many of the household recipes.
As never before or since, household entrepreneurs - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - have developed the country’s eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "housekeepers" and to meet the challenge of converting cotton like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of the historical bean.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-mich-Kuch-Pushen-Halking, are tasteful.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa Farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he eats like the millions of heavy men from the world to which he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with gurken sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost-golded dining room and wore a smoky.
He was a great stranger to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the owner of a housekeeper with no interest in flavoring by Mrs. Roosevelt led to the fact that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most reliable prepared."
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression, to deal with food, were rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs.
The vastness lies on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
The couple agreed to better understand the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example, how she could not throw away food.
"She was really afraid of the waste of food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windmill crash.
After the counters were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plumage dessert, President Roosevelt ate at noon.
"It's called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman and added that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes with a good name.
There was no slag, only flowers, some flour, sugar, water, and lime.
Everyone accidentally dived a fork into the bent, brown glibber.
Amazingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe got a tail three times.
Like a can-do-budgetier, he said to his wife, "A couple of hacked whales would help."
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at stake to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar devoted his life to people in Syria.
He risked everything to save others' lives.
Now the 30-year-old himself died in a phase bomb attack of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group, which, according to image-laying, so far saved nearly 60,000 people.
2900 Volunteers put their own lives at risk to get people out of bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civil defender showing him in an 11-hour rescue from the drummers of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrians a shining figure in the grey of the war.
But as a hero he never saw himself, according to a picture, he said, "For me, this is the real jihad."
"When I die to save life, I think God sees a murderer in me."
Shortly before Omar himself suffered an attack on the victim, he had spoken in a video about the recent bombings in Syria.
The helicopters threw four beam bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorgas.
One woman and two children die, seven people suffer from breathlessness.
"We now eliminate the toxic residue of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the image quoted his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime should have met terrorists.
Greenland hai: The oldest vertebrae is almost 400 years old
Rare view.
Greenland hai usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research ship.
He was born in 1624 and swims well 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - until today.
Greenland haie is only given 150 years of age.
The Greenland hai swims along the ground of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches on average just 1.220 meters.
Only when it arrives, the five-metre animal accelerates at a speed of 2.6 km/h - and is at this maximum speed half as fast as a robot.
This life-style marked by slowness, however, seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at any rate from a Greenland hai, which could be 392 years old.
"Wahnsinn", comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.
Even though the evolution biologist had long suspected that Greenland hai would be stoned.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, and finally they live mainly in the iceberg before the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures to the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland haie accordingly.
Their timetime pace is measured when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of peaks.
Nevertheless, in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a robot, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young ice bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the ground of the iceberg and seek cadres, which from higher water layers to the bottom.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues were now investigating 28 Greenland haie, who took fishermen from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitzbergen.
The smallest Hai was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed with the carbon-14 method the lens cores of the shark.
This center of the eyelid is already formed before the birth of the shark, the proteins contained in it are not renewed later.
The two smallest sharks eventually had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Therefore, their birth should be after the early 1960s when nuclear weapons tests increased the amount of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, in the 220 cm length of the smallest animal, the lens core included a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it may have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.
On the other hand, all the larger Greenland hai had normal carbon-14, which is produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere in their lens core.
In fact, the carbon-14 hour for a 493 centimetre long Greenland hai showed an age of 335 years, while the record hai with 502 centimetre may be 392 years old.
The greenlandhai weibchen was known only when they were more than four meters long.
Now the length researchers could assign an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of the sex line and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland hai with the increase can be seen for at least half a century.
This could also be a world record for vertebrates.
This is not a coincidence, especially in ice - cold waters.
The former record holder, a 211-year-old greenland whale, in which a 120-year-old harpoon tip on his neck was caught in front of Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on fire.
So they mature later - and older ones slower.
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.
For the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal absorbs heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: You have less enemies.
"A smaller animal thus lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having many descendants as early as possible," explains evolution biologist Scheuerlein.
On the other hand, a very large animal should invest its resources in a long life.
Double-Packing Construction Background
Topics related to construction have been of major concern to the municipality in the recent meeting.
With ease, the board took note of the announcement by Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of newly designated residential areas can finally begin".
After clarification of the issues of land, parceling and disposal and the application for measurement were made, the sale of land in the residential areas of "straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße area - Ext. 1) is no longer in the way of interest.
The municipality is convinced that the premises in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau address young families and quiet seniors alike.
As it was said, construction volunteers can report immediately to the council, the municipality will be consulted at its September meeting on the award of the parcels.
In order also to be able to comply with requests for the establishment of other establishments linked to the creation of jobs, the municipality decided to amend the area use plan in part-time only in the spring of this year.
Thus, in the area of sub-timers, the area of trade which has already been shown there is extended by two parcels towards Staatsstraße 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city of Main thus has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, Head of the field of competence, financial markets and real estate markets of the IW.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether cash houses can continue to operate from London out of financial businesses throughout the EU.
For the so-called EU passports, they still have the approval in the UK.
That's what big U.S. banks use.
Several banks have already announced leaving jobs.
The Lobby Association "Frankfurt Main Finance" has 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the main banks of the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisor EIOPA and the ESRB Risk Board.
Although the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the bank is important to banks, as they can communicate directly with supervision," says IW Professor Voigtlät.
Although Luxembourg was home to a large fund industry, it was less likely to cut down on infrastructure, as was Dublin.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
Also points the city with easily available commercial properties.
"It's not that easy to find high-quality offices in Paris," Voigtländer says.
In addition, the rentals for first-class commercial property were 50 percent higher than the Main.
Furthermore, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime.
In a ranking of Mercer's company advice, the city stood on the spot seven, Luxembourg on the scene 19, Dublin on the ground 33 and Paris on the 37th.
Even if quality of life is a matter of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract other banks and investors," the IW follows.
In spite of the Brexit vote, however, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, according to economic researchers.
For this reason, the force ratios also speak: in London, according to the figures of the Landesbank Helaba Ende 2015, about 144,000 people in the banking sector, there were 62500 in Frankfurt.
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
One U.S. official decided that Gilead Sciences Inc has a claim to reimburse the legal costs incurred by it in the Hepatitis C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from a compensation payment of $200 million for the breach of two Merck patents, which were associated with the Blockbuster medicines Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a US ruler discovered a pattern of Merck's misconduct, including meineide and other unethical actions.
On Thursday's hearing, U.S. Chief Justice Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead has a claim to release the costs incurred during the case's defense.
Merck is trying to get along with Gilead, which controls the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case goes back to the year 2013, when Gilead and Merck complained to each other and took ownership of laboratory work, which is based on Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead.
United States-supported troops say they have regained full control of Manbi from the Islamic state
U.S.-supported troops have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border, after the last IS fighters left it in the city, a speaker of the group said on Friday.
The democratic forces of Syria (DKS) are now marching through the city following the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves inside the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians who were held by the fighters as hostages, Sharfan Darwish shared with the Manbi Military Council of Reuters associated with the DKS.
"The city is now under complete control, but we're just running clean-up," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published her tax statement for 2015 on Friday, this award for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and their husband an income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, Clintons spent USD 1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.3 million in Redehonoraren; the former Foreign Minister gave a $3 million income from the Simon & Schuster magazine for her book about her time in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for the vice-president, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, published his tax statements together with his wife Anne Holton for the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency," said Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in a statement.
In sharp contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false statements and returns in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax statements.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements, although they are not obliged by laws because of them.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have given a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"They are on the train," Clinton's election assistant Ian Sams wrote on Twitter regarding the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's Special Adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax checks are completed.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of 2012 in the middle of Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal to ask questions about assets, his donations to charitable organizations, his business districts and various other connections, in particular with Russia.
Clinton has already been on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday in which high-ranking Republican Trump calls for his tax statement to be published.
On Thursday, she also spoke on the subject during a talk about the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the past decades and to publish his tax statements," she said to the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s, and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted on Friday a number of tax lawyers and tax advisors who indicated that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election struggle.
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that persons who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a election event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska called for Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has its seat here to exchange Trump to a meeting to exchange their tax statements.
Buffet said he was also subject to a tax examination of the IRS and Trump had "angst" before the voters and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clinton tax statement of 2015 showed that it refers only to USD 100 of its income as remuneration, other than the majority of all Americans.
Its main investment was a cost-effective index fund, from which Clinton's dividends and incomes of USD 109 000 were taxed.

Condoms with chilipuder, fireworks promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Naturalists in Tanzania use an unorthodox kind of to keep elephants from going to settlements inhabited by people - they throw condoms on those filled with chilipuder.
The method has proved to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea already years ago, has intensified its support, along with the US nature protection, by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a violent four-stage method to protect their houses and crops without harming animals.
Many muscles have previously been used to defend themselves.
Friday is a world day dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we have developed this ... toolkit, we have been able to observe within these communities a change in their attitude, and they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," said Honeyguide Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a fork and the blast in a horn.
If he's not scared, a so-called "chiliwoke" will be thrown away.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a firework body in a condom, whose end is turned to the ignition cord.
When it is lit, the condom spreads with a tap and sprays fine dust on chili powder into the air.
A hook is usually already out to beat the elephants.
One last possibility is a broadcaster who shoots a gold-ray firefight into the air and causes a loud, bright explosion.
City Council decided unanimously: No kiosknebouau at St. Goarer Rheinifer
Normally, St. Goarer's investment projects are undertaken by companies with Kusshand - but the retail trade in the core city is considered to be clearly comprehensive.
However, the city council refused to grant the application for the refurbishment of a shop at the Rhine-Palatinate in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine-Palatinate in the construction.
"We basically welcome new business operators, but at this location in an exposed position at the Rheinifer this kiosk does not fit," explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU.
Jewish director destroyed Berliner Hotel because Israeli choice was removed after "Arab" invitation - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots revealed a media riot after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed an Israeli preference, since it had "requested" Arab guests, according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust Documentation "Shoah" released his troubles at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the country list of hotels.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, the Kempinks Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center.
After a statement, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there was "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was "a deliberate decision of the management of the Kempinski Hotel."
The reason behind this was even more anger in the director's office.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the selection be deleted," the employee of Lanzmann was quoted.
The Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame", reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were disillusioned and disturbed by this event.
That's really embarrassing.
The fact that this has contributed to precisely this hotel chain in Germany is even a greater shame.
There's no need for an explanation.
We expect the hotel "to draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a pretty big resonance on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Some submitted to the Kempinski Hotel that it would have "refused" the supposed invitations of Arab guests.
"All of you," said another contribution, pointing out that the hotel, located at the noble Kurfürstendamm, is close to a synagogue.
The hotel quickly showed all the charges on its own and called the case a "conversion" and "accused" at Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct direction," Israel did not enter the fast-election list," the South German newspaper quoted a speaker from the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country selection has now been added.
Police employs Trengengas & rubber shots against Protestant Brazilian students
On Thursday, students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo, when they gathered to demonstrate against government reforms for the public education system.
The police set up gas and rubber shots against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began as police officers tried to drive the students apart, leading to the police using rubber and gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their frustration over the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, less than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money.
Some of the protestors were seen marching against the provisional President Michel Temer on walls.
The recent protests took place a few days after protestors went to the streets in masses to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate to withdraw from office.
Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly increases to 71% - RT Business
With the abolition of the sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagarian, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9% per cent per year.
Since the international sanctions were lifted against Iran, the Russian company's interest in business in the country grew strongly, the ambassadors said.
Russian companies maintain existing links with Iran while new companies are ready to access the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagarian said.
He noted that trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports in Iran increased by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
Trade increase was achieved by supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
This year, Dzhagaryan is dating from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia.
Last year, about 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, were issued to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries, with regard to the number of tourists in Russia.
It could be said that the records of Iranian tourists in Russia have been broken since last year," he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd that have received the monuments of old Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.
Witnesses sought: Drink market in forest bröl
On Thursday night, a robbery occurred on the market of Rewe XXL at the forest bröler Gerberstraße.
In the face of a gun, three darkly dressed persons who suspected their faces demanded the release of cash from the employees of the drinking market and then fled on foot and then probably with a silver-coloured VW golf.
How much money has been spent, the police don't share.
The workers should have been between 1,60 and 1,70 meters, so relatively small.
The drinking market is directly accessible and poorly visible from the deck of the rewe market.
According to the accident in Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engebert-Rog and the parking lot opposite the park entrance must have escaped with the silver-coloured car, possibly in B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations at the time (compared to 7.45 p.m.) that are related to the theft incident should report urgently to the police.
Nagold: game and fun on summer holidays
Eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social pedagogical day group/social group work of the child protection band Nagold with their caregivers on their summer vacation in Nussdorf, near Mühllaker.
In the quiet Frizeitheim Hardwäldle, the lively group was accommodated during the first week of school.
Several full-time trips were on the program.
One day it went to Brett with the visit of the stripeelzoos.
To the other, to Maulbronn, where there was a special guidance in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
At the Keltenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group experienced much about the day and the food of the Kelten.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maulbronn, which included jumping, swimming and planning.
Culinary children and caregivers with their own prepared body food, such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seabronner Pfänlle, Isselshauser-Bloff, the English breakfast and Tübinger Bolognase were missed.
In workshops, it was beaten, made beautiful pieces of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game.
Other highlights of leisure were the fishing in a nearby pond, the evening at the fire and the final "Bunde evening".
On the day of the return home, the sun and the children and young people were happy to return home.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims for Pforte of Mercy
The ministers from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch unit of the soul were travelling on a four-day pilgrimage from Villalingen to Freiburg.
Four steps have been taken together.
In order to bridge the time to the next Romwalfahrt for two years, the St. Anna High Minister has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage goals were examined and finally decided for the Bishops' City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrim goal was offered with the fort of mercy opened up to this day at Freiburg Münster.
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and the Holy Rooms were on their way.
Earlier in the evening, the Pilgrims sent out the Pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrims and distributed the Pilgrims.
From Horb was driven by train to the starting point of Villelingen, where a model of our love woman is also standing and so the pilgrimage was attacked by the Münster.
The individual day tours were framed every morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and written texts.
But also on the way, the Minis of field crosses, chapels, or churches were constantly making a song to sing together from a specially composed Pilger-Liefhäft.
For the nights, parish homes of the local parishes were available.
Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller took care of the stage goals for a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day it went over Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
At that time, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most demanding route, had to be reached at first about 500 meters high in the heat and then hit again.
The reward was a common barbecue at Badweiher in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrim day in St. Peter's impressive monastery, it went to the final stage in Freiburg.
The Minis met in the late afternoon at the Freiburger Münster and walked through the gates of mercy.
A small impulse was given here thanks to God.
In the evening exhibition in Münster, the Minis arrived at the Pilgrim's goal was welcomed by co-operator Markus Obert.
After the service of God, the pilgrims were able to visit the priesthood and the high priest.
The next day was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon it went back by train to Horb.
Finally, all the participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.
Shotte Callum Skinner storms home when Brite Gold reaches for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner spent the last night in the men's team's sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame, when the British team defended the title of London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself his own. The boy's tip made the legend proud when he stormed home to celebrate a victory of the favorite New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in March at the London World Championships in spite of Hoys' retreat.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the leader Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as a Hindu.
Today's silence created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the bulkhead that has now spread.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinners set up an Olympic league in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealand countries won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was back shortly after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.
A change in strategy made a large part of the transformation, when the Hindus drove in a higher direction to slow him down and enable Kenny and especially the Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy looked out of his position as BBC experts and fell down Skinner, Kenny and Hindus as they went up to the podium.
The 23-year-old skater from Glasgow said, "It's a ridiculous comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.
In the end, we have set up an Olympic league and won the World Cup.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 Triumph on the Kennys and Hoys side, Hindus admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell onto the train.
He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection from England's rivals.
In such an amazing victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like the whole GB flag on the tribune like London."
We've been together as a team in the last three months.
We got away so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that won seven of 10 titles in Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we will have a successful five days in Velodrom.
With the form of Kennys it is possible that he repeats the Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would be for Kenny - who is just 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23rd (an apparently holy date for British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - meant an advantage of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That's the one from Hoy.
Kenny participates as next in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
He said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be shot at the knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Doul qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.
They arrived at 3:51,942 at the target.
The world record won in 2012 in London Gold was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) takes place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will certainly be in focus.
Yesterday, he had argued with officials before the qualification when he was called by officials to measure his body size.
In the corresponding women's competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavie advanced in the world record time at 4:13,260.
The GB team relys on its strong railway team to dominate the mid-term period of the Olympic games and to get a lot of medals.
After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domination in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were undermined.
The dramas were played in the background, so the retreat of technical leader Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexualism and mobbing projections, as well as the rest of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks as if the now legendary call of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated.
The future of Portland's melting industry due to the repeal of the Energy Treaty
The future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - is at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thereby terminates all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company reported.
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant.
A grant for 20 years will expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.
In addition, domino effect could occur as the melting industry consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity production of Victorias.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry Schmelzerei, which led last year to a closure of the Anglosea power plant.
Alcoa's meddling in Portland loses money and risks closing.
This step follows the years-long speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and lastly due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium blender with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, reported that it is expected that three other owners will terminate their contracts.
The plant is mostly owned by a joint venture by Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp have smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity through the melting process," the company said.
AGL continued to say that the contracts were "safety business" which would have entered into force as of November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month expiry date so that they will end in 2017.
"From this point, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the financial year 17," said the power supplier.
All potential impacts on AGL revenue from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasting of the strong market for wholesale currents.
AGL reported that it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual conclusion of $187 million in "Awaiting an Termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contracts, "the ability to operate the melting mill or to ensure the supply of electricity to the melting mill" was not detrimental.
The US company said that in 2010, it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which would have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still guilty of a declaration of why it has withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts warn because of the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland Melselzerie in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
In relation to the analyst's statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts and tomago about 900 megawatts per year.
If both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [power market].
And it would not be good for us as power generators," he said.
More than just a Kardashian Reality TV Star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the desired issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, who is the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and was on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, I got the view of this cover for wine," Kendall wrote.
The revelation of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), written reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of Rob and Caitlyn's problems and in the presence of the most popular showbiz angle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as she forgot the cover of her sister and ended it with a classic change: they all planned a surprise party.
This represents the cliché-related act almost every birthday episode of a child's delivery (Seacrest brought the sentence, "Did you think we had forgotten you?", with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a post at 8:00 a.m.), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity somewhere.
With a view to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's great sister Kim likes to beat her about the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were looking at it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for herself.
The September issue is for Vogue the most sold issue of the year.
With a volume that resembles a film band rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertising operators (according to fashionista were from the 832 pages of the Wälzer 615 pages of advertising).
The disclosure of his coverstars is expected to be so curious that in the last two years, images of the magazine were still safe before the official announcement.
Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been clearly more "familiarities that model" than "models that are famous" on the cover.
Oscar Prize winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.
But even in the low chance that Mrs. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakdown model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people from today who know how to turn a good snapshot video (even if all of this applies to girls).
They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the publication of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.
Of course, not everyone likes Jenner's success.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense.
In June, the single Victoria's Secret Model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticised her and called her "the mystery of the moment."
These feelings were cooked up again when the message came out with the appearance of females on the Vogue Cover.
But to ride around on the nonsense seems to pass the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.
It is in the true sense of the word a supermodel.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She makes advertising for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
You and all your sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective payall apps.
She sells pictures made by Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her leisure, she is watching in reality TV. Probably just to see her sister Kurtney and her children.
Community law centres show 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the country's aid needs are rejected annually by the Community law centres, while the sector focuses on the effects of further reductions on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, helpful workers, victims of violence and those who do not have funds for illegal delogations and similar ones - are already denied free legal advice and legal assistance on their applications.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already overloaded, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centres are expected to lose another 30 per cent of their federal resources.
The director of the community rights centres of Queesland, James Farrell, said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Rights Centres revealed that thousands of people are already rejected each year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the Federal Government's decision.
"Queensland's community rights centres are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people of important services you need are rejected," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with insurmountable and oppressive debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been unjustly released - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will reduce the funding by 30 per cent, which means that thousands of more needy people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any assistance.
We call on the Attorney-General and the Federal Minister of Justice and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to remove these cuts immediately, so that people can get the help they need in the face of legal problems.
Last year, the Government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of Community law centres and their customer communities and that the Government of Palaszczuk invests in this important work.
Donald Trump Election campaign charged after employees allegedly pulled weapons
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was accused of alleged inactivity after she was informed that her campaign leader for North Carolina had turned a gun into an employee in February while they were on their way to a jeep in February.
The case is described in an indictment filed in the Court of Justice of Charlotte on Wednesday by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this federal state.
Bordini indicated to have waited months for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that "it would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "takes a gun, places his right finger on the draw, and hits the run in Vincents Kniekelhe," Bordini said in his indictment.
After complaining about the local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said.
The prosecution will only come two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered an alarm when he said a crowd in North Carolina that the Second Amendment People - gun owners and friends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and judges should be re-elected.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of the context and that he would not resort to violence.
Bordini's complaint requires compensation from the campaign for the breach of care obligations and from Philip for physical injury and other mental damage.
Trump's press speaker Hope Hicks was not able to reach an opinion.
Trying to contact Philip failed as well.
WCCB, a local messenger in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a campaign employee.
He did not respond to calls from his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
The procedure is called Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: survey in front of countries: lose SPD and CDU
The upcoming elections in the Federal Republic of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) show significant losses for the government parties SPD and CDU.
This presented representative surveys of the INSA Research Institute for the "Image" section (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could hardly continue to rule, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.
In both federal countries, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have a good chance to continue to be the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party is only shortly before the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is between the left and the AFD.
The left came to 19 percent (as before 18.4 percent), the AFD would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the land day.
In spite of slight losses of 6 percent (before 8.7 percent), the greens return to the Black Land Day.
NPD and FDP would not be represented by 3 per cent in the country day.
At the Berlin House of Representatives' Election, the survey's SPD only reached 23 per cent (2011 elections: 28.3 per cent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
They are still behind the greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but above the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AFD would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Representatives.
By 5 per cent, the FDP could hope to return, but the pirates would miss the introduction in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in time: 20 years ago the Nokia communicator came to the market.
The followers today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't good in hand either.
On the contrary, it was pretty nice.
The built-in storage was at the beginning of eight megabytes, which would now be enough for about two selfies with high resolution.
An iPhone is currently delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 communicator" came into business just 20 years ago on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they come somehow from the stone age of the Internet age.
20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit Computer Fair in Hanover as "Office in Western Business Format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could send and receive a lot of texts and e-mails for then standards, even by fax was to be reached by the communicator.
Even the access to web sites was possible via HTML browser, even if it is very slow.
A pocket computer was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a little antenna, and the phone could be tapped like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
In August 1996, no one realized that the communicator of the beginning of the smartphone era would become.
Since then, everything's different.
The smart phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia.
The mobile part of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold and developed to Microsoft.
Today, the market is dominated by suppliers, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
Always be online everywhere, this is today for a lot of people every day.
In 2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Some 1.4 billion devices were sold, and only 555 million of them were made on Samsung and Apple.
Worldwide turnover with the equipment is around 400 billion euros.
To this end, the well-running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has been created around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market began in 2007, when Apple Chief Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator, to use everything easily via touch screen.
The victory of Apple began, and today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who ruled the market, had the reputation.
They're finally gone, Blackberry has to fight.
The story now has Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a self-understanding 20 years after its invention.
On average, today every German looks at his phone for 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to even move the smartphone away," said Janina Kugel, who is responsible for staff in Siemens.
At the same time, permanent availability is considered to be a curse and a blessing.
England must link the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring not only renewal and prosperity in our local municipalities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the biggest attraction Heathrows, just as in 2012 in London, when we made a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we alone will create 10,000 new teachers, create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport area.
As they were before us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrows is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blame ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also lie with Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question he asks.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual infrastructure projects.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, to create £211 billion in scientific growth and to leave an abundance of skills and employment both to the airport and to the whole GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from the T5 - which has been selected for five consecutive years to the world's best airport terminal until the T2, which was built between the two most frequent stages of the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third step, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time that we draw this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow and secure our future trade and create an abundance of skills and employment that can be proud of England.
Lord Paul Deighton is president of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretariat to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "Katz and Mouse" about Ad Blocking
For companies that earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturer's attempts to deal with advertising blockage, a "cat and mouse game" is the same.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertisements on its desktop, Adblock Plus published a blog post stating that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook told that his desktop would change the encoding of his ads to make it difficult to identify which part of the advertising page is.
But Adblock announced that it had found a new way to deal with the new codes.
In a blog post, the speakers of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of hin-and-her-fight between the ad-blocking open source community and the environment is already in progress since the invention of ad-blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying ad-blockers have become for the industry.
According to a recent study by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people use advertising blockers worldwide; almost four times in 2013.
With 1.03 billion active users daily accessing Facebook via their mobile end devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook advertising revenue.
The company saw it on display blockers on Desktop PCs, as mobile display blockers had no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a speaker said.
Advertising on Desktop PCs accounts for a large proportion of the revenues, so Facebook appears to invest such a step as a pay value.
On Tuesday Facebook announced that it would update its "Advertising Preferences Tool" to give people more control over their advertising.
On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblocks' new filter would be worrying, because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising.
"This is not a positive experience for the users, so we plan to address the problem," a Facebook speaker shared in an e-mail message.
Showblockers are a stupid means, so instead we have focused on developers tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in the hands of people.
Overrun woman in suspected suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a woman was transferred to a highway in the early hours of the morning on Thursday at a suspected suicide by several vehicles.
The event took place on the A1 near Morges in Canton Waadt shortly after midnight.
A woman lay in the dark "in an act of despair" on the street and were hit by several cars, the police said in Waadt.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 who was overrun by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been spotted, but some have still not been identified, the police said that they and every witness of the incident are invited to report.
An investigation procedure was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be expected whether one of the drivers will be shown.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something that the prosecutor has to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held accountable.
In each of the two cases - in which a person lived in the darkness on the highway - it was decided that the drivers did not have to leave that a pedestrian was walking on the highway in the middle of the night, as it was called in the newspaper.
Last year, a police officer was released after she had taken over and killed a man who was on A1 one night in August 2014 near Payeren.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policemen -- who had responded to an emergency -- did in a justifiable way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "very extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once inhabited
The Venus was probably once inhabited according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 thick atmosphere could have demonstrated similar conditions at one time.
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation indicates that the Venus might have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and yet slowly moved on.
The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protect it from rapid poisoning.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent more.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow turn of Venus exposes its day side of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which works like a rain screen to shield the surface from a large part of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than those on earth today.
The model presented a history of Venus, similar to the evolution that was previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although she was probably a resident at one time, Venus -- over the course of billions of years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned out of ultraviolet light.
As their hydrogen developed, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained, the Venus, which we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus Climate Model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy returns as a coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche and introduced too little co-determination in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will seek a new trainer immediately.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in an opinion.
During the summer I thought about how I could improve this team in order to give him more depth, this needs it and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned to those of the organization.
He must also have a right of co-determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who was quoted by Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patric told me about this decision today," said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
During his debut season, Roy was awarded the Avalanche 2013-14 as winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the League.
He led the association to 112 points and to the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was hit in the first round of Minnesota’s playoffs and missed the after-season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches listed a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second Wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, strike out
Working struggles for the compensation of North Sea oil workers are suspended, while all the fighting parties are placing themselves at the table for a new round of talks, said negotiators.
Strikes against the oil service provider Wood Group were sporadicly performed on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the United and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to re-start the settlement process of the current struggle," it says in a common statement.
We will hold some full-day meetings in the coming weeks, which will begin next year in order to address the problems again.
The unions said that their last strike, the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year Wood Group has reduced its rates to its North Sea contractors by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in the company's rate is 10 per cent decrease for Onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts would give the company the space needed to get through the market failure.
Shell has released thousands of people for its part and has announced plans to end its oil and gas business in up to 10 countries, as it rationalises its business as a result of its mega-combination with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to the lower raw materials prices, an economic situation which had been strengthened by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
The Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have taken place since a generation in the North Sea.
The North Sea is important to the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few," he said in a statement.
In 2016 less than $1.4 billion is expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of $7 billion over the last five years.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the constellations of the Pleiades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the stars of the Pleiades.
The new data help the astronomers to understand why stars in the constellations rotate at different rates and in what context are the rotation times with the planetary rise.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebul, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The constellation of the Pleiades is 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars in this constellation, which occurred some 125 million years ago, now reach the adult age.
They're turning the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these giant stars emit large amounts of star winds.
Since this wind travels through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a detectable star spot -- like sunlight --
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.
Rebul compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars spinning slowly pirouettes smaller than smaller ones.
"In the ballet of the pleas we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebul said.
Since the stars of the Pleiades are so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The constellation of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebul said.
There is still much more to be learned about how, when and why stars slow down their rotational rates and so to say they hang their "sanction shoes".
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspapers their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial Baseball star emerges
The trains lived at Alex Rodriguez faster than the US Baseball Star in the best days from Base to Base.
After his emotional resignation, the 41-year-old professional against Tampa Bay Rays will be wearing his New York Yankee shirt for the last time on August 12.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," explained the 14-time All-Star Game participant of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Trimal was chosen Rodriguez as the most valuable player in the league, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract has protected him for 27 million US dollars a year since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, it will function as a consultant and youth coach - with full content.
As a player it paid Rodriguez a long time back with power.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994-2000), Texas Rangers (2001-2004) and since 2005 he created the Yankees made some milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players show similar values in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-olds should not be admitted to the baseball gym.
Because so successfully Rodriguez - top name "A-Rod" - was on the field, so contesting his appearance is outside the square.
Already in 2009 the Superstar at "ESPN" added that steroids prohibited between 2001 and 2003 had been taken.
In August 2013, it was closed for 211 parties due to a development in the so-called biogenesis scandal by the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered the main suspect to have been given an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal dispute, the gap was still reduced to 162 meetings.
"The League could have done me a favor for 2014, because I spent 20 years without a break," said Rodriguez at the time.
Also, his days of separation do not run out of silence.
While many baseball legends in their last games still have the big stage, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bank.
"My job doesn't include a divorce tour."
"My job involves trying to win every game," said Yankee Coach Joe Girardi.
In time Rodriguez, who was married to the actor Cameron Diaz and the relationship with Popstar Madonna and the actor Kate Hudson, became familiar with the fans of the Yankee-Earth rival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the followers sang at 4:9 a.m. on the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silvia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases
Acquired: Due to a positive doping test, weightmaker Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overestimated by the first official doping cases.
A acquired athlete would have won almost a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping cases have become known to the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre obstacle runner Silvia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polishweight Adrian Zielinski were tested positively and excluded in Brazil - just before the start of the ever-critically critical athletic contests, these messages come to an unexpected conclusion.
In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was demonstrated last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Court of Sport CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympics on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-olds had placed the fourth place in the finale over 100 m Schmetterling, only 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen would have to take part in the pre-wars over 50 m of freistyl.
Chen asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the opening of the B-test and a hearing.
The National Association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation from Chen in the investigations", Xinhua quoted a statement: "We will cooperate with the International Court of Justice CAS and accept the judgment".
The first time in history is no longer the IOC, but the CAS for the sanctioning of athletes with positive cases.
Also in the night of Rio, the message about the positive sample at Danekowa was guaranteed, and the 33-year-old went to the offensive itself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," that was "an incredible shock," she told the Bulgarian TV broadcast BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," said the light athlete.
According to the report, the prohibited substance is to be used for the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekwawa was temporarily suspended, according to BNT the B sample should also be positive.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissow immediately reported his criticism of the Athletics.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said. "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
Thus, for example, all weight gainers from the chronic doping-loaded nation must not participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case was also known as "Adrian Zielinski", the London Olympic winner in the class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tomasz three days earlier positive on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.
Both fight the intake, however, both must not start in the class up to 94 kg.
Prior to the start of the light athletes, especially the Danekowa case is another difficult blow for the reputation of the entire sport.
The IAAF World Association had prevented the full Russian team from launching up to an exception due to systematic doping, and the Kenyan race also produced numerous bad news in Rio.
In the sport of swimming, the earlier crimes in China also provided for severe conflicts between athletes.
So the French Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang hard.
"Sun of the pink pink. "
"When I see the podium over 200 m of frestil, I want to surrender," said Lacourt in French radio.
Sun was also at the centre of a dispute with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I don't have time and respect for doping predators," he said.
Sun was tested in 2014 in the Chinese championships positively on the Stimulant Trimetazidin, but only a three-month suspension had to be left.
Data Key: So Perfectly Express Hacker Your Solving Money
Programmers of repression malware are currently targeting targeted companies - and are successful.
According to a current survey by the Malware defence specialist Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the United Kingdom and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been at least once in the past 12 months, partly victims of an attack with Erpresser software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies were already target of a ransomware expression.
40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the damages required by the victims in order to be able to reuse the systems and data they attacked.
The operators specialize in their epressive software according to the observations of Malwarebytes in view of attacks in corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the potential solution is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently observing a frightening fast evolution of the damage software," explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in the conversation with the "world".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the actors discovered the compression software for themselves.
At first, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was horrifying in the past few months.
Ransomware works for a simple pattern: Once active on the computer of a victim, it looks for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as for archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the originals permanently.
The software then presents the demands of the oppressors.
In order to get the closing code to the files, the victims must transfer money - usually in the form of the bitcoin cryptocurrency.
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are looking for sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is stopped.
Therefore, the damage is higher if a ransomware is added.
22% of the German companies concerned reported loss of turnover by Ransomware, 13% even had to stop the business completely, in one case people were at risk of life.
In Germany, hospitals have already been victims of attacks, which can be seriously threatened by the loss of disease acts.
"We always say to the victims: don't count, you only support the problem," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the operators, given the state of the operation.
The hackers know that and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a current study, F-Secure's security researchers have investigated the user interfaces and contact with the oppressors and come to the result: The perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims by chat how they can pay by bitcoin, direct freely accessible support websites or decrypt anyway example files.
And after payments of a few hundred euros, private people have to be redeemed, companies have to negotiate in part and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencumbered.
In view of the potential high and relatively risk-free profits from the ransomware oppression, the hackers become more and more professional and share the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos explains: "A single person can write a ransomware about a week."
However, it is more likely that it is three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software building box to the actual expressors.
The previous Malware kits were created by buying the Malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a single, fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
"Contained in delivery is an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
Then the rapists are looking for further hackers to distribute the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So one logs in one of the forums in the background, buys the set from a criminal and orders another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
The payment is made per infected computer.
"usually the criminals then order spammer with the distribution," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
Over 50 percent of the company's IT-responsors in the Malwarebytes survey rely on being able to resist ransomware through file-backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the operators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If data encryption alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators are threatened instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski.
Thus, according to the type of data, the damage potential is even more numerous than before.
In the future, the actors could also take up a completely new agenda on the Internet for things.
Security researchers at the Defcon hacker conference demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the release of such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom to some of the victims.
If the operators then instead of heating in the future block a whole manufacturing road in a factory, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.
One for All Cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little cup and also the diversity of a minivan.
It sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new jazz, is in fact proved to be highly flexible throughout the day.
Although only 1.60 m high HR-V works rather small, passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the fund, it does not work at any place.
The materials of the interior are well-processed and appear pleasant, only the cockpit top is slightly down there.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles at the station.
There is not only a pocket room of 453 l at high and 1026 l at covered back loans, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: The back seat surfaces can climb up like a kinosessel and thus offer a stauraum, which is from the ground to the roof of 1.24 m.
The trunk can be loaded well, however, the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 PS accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide rotational ranges.
However, he should do his work a little quieter.
The daily consumption is 4.7 l/100 km.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-l-benzer with 96 kW/130 PS.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the drive should be something more direct.
The equipment does not allow the "Executive" option to be opened in the tested top version.
The security systems include the City Emergency Brake Assistant (works up to Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the tracer.
The collision warning sometimes irritates because it evaluates many obstacles as "relevant objects" in ranking.
The remote control is very reliable.
And the intelligent tempo control reacts to the traffic sign recognition and drains speed if necessary.
But the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touch screen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and a HDMI book are under the armpit and are therefore somewhat accessible.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are in order.
Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro-6 exhaust standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline not hanging: Storm on the airtight bridge
An airline is not liable for the crash of a passenger on the airport bridge.
As a liability is only conceivable in the case of risks typical of air transport, the Düsseldorf Oberlandesgericht argued (Ag. 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a record during the storm.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life, so the Court of Justice.
The airline did not have to pay the man any damages.
Disease: When the organizer pays
Sick holidayers only get back money after their trip when the cause of the disease is no doubt found in the hotel.
But this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms.
In the case negotiated, a family was seriously injured on the second day of their Turkish leave.
She spent almost all her vacation in the room.
Their illness led the vacationers back to a defective clearing plant, which was supposed to have polluted the sea.
The family was the view that the trip was thus indiscriminate and complained against the organizer.
The plaintiffs had no success before the court.
Even the clearing system was actually defective.
The organizer, however, only recently experienced the withdrawal of the complaints.
He had to leave until then that seawater was all right.
So he did not violate his information obligations, so the verdict.
There was no contamination in the samples of the water.
The illness of several hotel guests - perhaps by interfering with each other - belongs to the general risk of life.
Of the 691 guests, only 38 were sick.
De Maizière said that after the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The state had to be determined to respond to terrorist threats at the same time.
Surely our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
This triumph will not be granted to the terrorists.
If criminals were to leave the country faster, however, it would increase security and also strengthen the people's agreement on refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to implement the proposals until the 2017 federal election.
He also announced a further personal reinforcement of the security forces, "in the middle quadrilateral order over several years".
Sympathy for terrorism had to be punished again.
Video surveillance is intended to improve the new arms law so that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is particularly difficult.
The most recently debated obligation for doctors is to remain in line with the words of the Maizière.
However, in the dialogue with the doctor, he wants to look for solutions to reduce the danger of the public, he said with a view to mental illness.
In order to counter the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
For the prosecution of criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet) de Maizière plans the use of hidden detectors.
SPD Chief Gabriel said, "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security".
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has made a clear statement against actionism.
"This was an earmark for the sharpmaker in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the news of the Funke Media Group (Friday).
De Maizière had previously refused to sign a Burka ban from the Union and the abolition of double nationality.
A general prohibition of full disclosure is considered to be constitutionally problematic.
You can't forbid everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burka.
It is possible to speak about rules in road transport or for witnesses before the courts.
Green Chief Simone Peter suggested to the Minister that he always want to simulate action and ability with new anti-terrorism packages.
Left-Party Bernd Riexinger said, "Flott language and strengthening of the right of residence no longer brings security to people in this country".
Better traffic flow on the motorway
It stands regularly on the surrounding road - here a picture from November.
But this is to change: the legal challenge is to be extended.
This is a good message for all car drivers who are on the road of the environment every night when they drive over the highway (A 43).
On the next Tuesday and Wednesday (August 16th) in the area between the Hammer Street and the departure of Weseler Straße, the road is extended by 700 metres.
Drivers can then directly slide right from the Hammer Street.
The great advantage: Transport is taking place earlier, thus improving the overall flow of the section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU fraction in the area represented Münster-West.
The driver's ride on the trailer is particularly nervous between 17 and 19 hours.
Working days are enough to get back to the bridge over the Albersloher road and sometimes beyond it.
The main reason is the needle watch on the B 51 shortly before the departure of Weseler Straße.
From here, traffic is only unilaterally linked over the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt about one and a half years ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required carrying force to double the load traffic in particular.
As long as this engpass and the associated daily rate will last, the competent country operator cannot say.
However, it is to be calculated with years: because the bridge has an official residue duration until 2034.
For the extension of the legal loopholes, the country's operation has deliberately chosen the weaker time in school because it is to be counted with obstacles.
The transport is carried over unanimously at the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural Travel: Cultural Offers for Schools
The international class of the forest school visited the theatre "The Invisible House".
The association Nima's and the young theater now plan a music project.
Nima's association allows young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Forest School Children's House has visited a presentation of the award-winning piece "The Invisible House" of the Boy Theatre Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Travel" initiated by Nima's Association, 19 students visited the stage in the small house between eleven and 15 years old.
Since the beginning of the year, the Association, which has set the goal of the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Between September 2015 and March 2016, most of the young people of the class came from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria to Münster and spoke little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, it was possible for them to follow the course of action, so the press release of the Boy Theatre Münster.
The Nima's association, founded by Dr. Tanaz Westerberg from Language, and the young theatre will work together in the next play time in a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without refugee and migration backgrounds between 14 and 20 years of age will be given the opportunity to attend professionally inspired courses in the fields of singing, dancing, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre and theatrical language communication are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
In view of the increased numbers of refugees, the association counts with many classes who want to participate.
Rain Instead of Starbucks: Hope for better weather
The weather has made the starbuster sugars in southwestern Germany in the night to Friday a strike through the bill - but there is hope.
The night was hard for clouds and rain to observe the sky, said the president of the Star Warte Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is at night for Saturday.
The weather's supposed to be good, then we're sure to see a lot of stars in the sky.
The constellations are the most fast-tracked beaches, with 216,000 kilometres per hour.
They have their name, because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Restful Night: Tips against Sleeping Disorders
In the evening you wander around forever, in the night you lie awake for hours, in the morning it is already far from the windshield to think of sleep.
That's all but relaxing.
At the same time, you are in good company with such problems: according to Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently unrestable.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders occur?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there may be a variety of reasons for them, says Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What you understand on the ground is, but the insomnia, that is, a breakdown of sleep and sleep.
Just as many people feel that sleep is unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, a board member of the German Home Medical Association with practice in the Netherlands.
What's behind sleep disturbances?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Afterwards, organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medications, can be applied.
Sleep disorder is not uncommonly an expression of another disease.
"Very early awakening is especially common in depression," says Wess.
And it may be that different factors work together.
For example, someone who has an accident can lie down badly, wakes up every two to three hours, and begins, perhaps, to grumble about everyday problems and concerns, sets an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
Since when should you go to the doctor with sleep disorders?
Anyone who is not well asleep for a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is affected by the day should go to the doctor, advises Wess.
The impairment may seem quite different: you are tired, tired, unsleepy, have difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily reactive, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.
It is important to find out the causes of sleep disturbance.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medications - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
There is hardly any in Germany, says Prof. Ingo Vietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine centre of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, you should first contact your doctor for sleep problems, advise Wess.
It can be examined to see if the problems have a physical cause.
Who's supposed to go to the bedroom, and what's going on?
For the study in the sleeping laboratory, physicians advise, for example, in snorkels with respiratory dissipators, in painful daily fatigue, in sleepwalkers, or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, vietze explains.
In fact, you don't have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Just don't make a lunch break," says Vietze.
After the cable, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body you wear a noseglass, a chest belt and a sensor on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the deck shows the sleeping person.
How can the problems of the affected be tackled?
There are quite many job screws to which you can apply for a better sleep.
Wess count: Regular sleep and rest periods, not too long in bed, not sleeping on the day, not sleeping on TV, drinking and not looking at the clock at night - then you start counting immediately, and that's quite not conducive.
What the jungle camp has with missing medals in the swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Debler has voiced on Facebook the disappointment of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he won gold at the Doha World Cup for the first time and at the same time set up his first world record.
Now the former DSV-Athlet Markus Debilr has been protecting himself from his former teammates who are critical.
"In a country where an Olympic winner receives €20,000 and a jungle king €150,000 should no one wonder about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The promotion system in swimming sport is bad, but doping controls are very good.
So we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely at the topic or even operate it.
"I'm not saying that the controls should be set here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Debelr had to be notified nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That is exactly how you should deal with countries.
"Those who cannot be controlled for a certain time before WM/OS by the WADA/FINA independent controllers must not participate," asks the election Hamburger, who currently operates an ice component.
Airport: Bonds of luggage caught
Professional thief at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, Düsseldorf police officers arrested two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61.
The suspects had started several pockets and luggage counts as gangs.
By 21:30 p.m., civil officials in Düsseldorf Airport again recognized a band known to the police from past theft camps.
Since mid-July this year, the two women and two men had committed several crimes and had gone through community, work, and especially professional activities.
The Specialists of the Office of the Criminal Commissioner 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who had been sent to Germany to commit crimes.
They had taken over EUR 15,000 in total.
Old buildings, a few Linden trees, while still another headstone patch: The Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work at first sight, but the police count it as the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you go from east to west, you get to playgrounds, a freshly decorated children's garden and a bioload.
At the facade of a grey house, someone has sprayed "hate!".
A house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be built in 2017.
However, articles about this "trend district", as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls it, are preferably represented in the last few weeks by burning cars.
The reason is the house with number 94: Once it was occupied, the inhabitants have rented contracts, but on the ground floor still have rooms and are used for events.
Especially since the beginning of the year, Berliner Intensenator Henkel has repeatedly spoken against the project, the area as "No-Go-Zone" for police and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
On 22 June, after the rooms on the ground floor, which had been cleared by 300 police officers, the police patrolled for three weeks official statements with 30 to 40 officers and three crew cars on the ground, blocked parts of the road and kept visitors from entering the house with number 94.
Meanwhile, the rooms were renovated by construction workers on behalf of the unknown houseowners.
On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the premises were illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew under the delight of sympathetics and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the road seems peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the stairs in front of the houses in the sun, and others are taking a look at Späti.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neubauer, who has been living in Kyez since 1999, and Jana*, who is raising three children here, are especially generated by the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects they share the care of rising rent and generification.
It doesn't sound like it's after a election that most of the police were trying to protect themselves from vandalizing links.
The grave, which the Berlin Interior Senator and the police open between housekeepers and their neighbors, does not appear to exist.
Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working district, which has a low average income and a high risk of poverty today compared to the rest of the city.
Houses and their home projects have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990 many houses were occupied in the former DDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Street near Riga.
While the Mainzers were hiding under a large police offer in a regular street fight, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years the district has become increasingly the magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world: with them residents from DDR times and former houseowners share their Kiez.
This is also noticeable for rentals that have increased by almost 60 percent in new rentals since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognized on inserted discs or freshly cut façades, which have been cast with colour pencils.
No other street was mentioned so often this year along with the words "linksautonome violence".
One reason why not all neighbors view it as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: Crimes such as physical injury are almost exclusively directed against policemen.
Most of the crimes are causing damage to the industry, which tend to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neubauer, who has lived in a rented house for 17 years next to the disputed 94, there can be no doubt.
As for violent people, it is overwhelming: The people in 94 are their neighbours, who were certainly not.
Even the famous burning cars there are no longer in the rigaer directly.
For the studied architects, their street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than from others."
New building is deliberately pulled into the Riga Street - and remained.
That was why it was so important for the residents to return to their streets: from the police, politics and the media, all of which suddenly claimed the height of clarity over the area in July.
But in the eyes of the inhabitants like the New Buildings, the road will continue to be taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former buildings that oppress the old inhabitants.
"These are, in the end, properties that are not interesting for many here - rather people living here who are not so well-known," she says.
"Gevolt and destruction, I can't say good-bye."
But what should you do if someone never hears?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neubauer has little understanding for the trainees who are angry with color mines: The house projects and the left scenes were part of the Kiez.
Anyone who moves should be aware of it - just like someone who drags himself into a cage area, there can complain badly about noise.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in matters of integration and organizer.
She is also a local social worker.
Since July, Annika Deuschle is the refugee officer for Urbach.
The Sozialpädagogin supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group Refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else is involved.
Regina Kunde from the working class indicates that the honorary officials are more than grateful that Bogichle is now there, the venerable wool milk sauce, which has a problem above all.
In this way, some - less ridiculed rather than objecting to the multitude of tasks desired - meant that the administration wanted to write the place out.
An administrative force was sought with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just as an ovaries of wool.
But administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, work with people on the spot and also behind the scenes as well as networking.
The 31-year-old has been on it for about six weeks.
She's frozen a 50-percent post for three years.
"It was the highest time," says Regina Kunde, "that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and senior actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Soon new containers are standing in the Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been finding apartments for the refugees who have been recognized for some time.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living quarters.
The cost of building, renting or refurbishing these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility changes from the Land Council to the municipalities and the work centre.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been considered very difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.
It does not work until now, in which you are directed to private apartments, so Boishle.
Therefore, community apartments must be enchanted, as it is called.
So soon new containers will be installed in the Wasenstraße.
But it's just not done with apartments.
From the perspective is the word, Regina Kunde and Annika Douschle agree.
In addition to a firm stay, there are workshops, training centres, schools, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up.
"More places would be good," says Regina customer.
Many work in the Bauhof or help the housekeepers, perform non-profit work - and that motivates and is very orderly, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive external impact.
That's "no therapy for employment".
But activity does not mean just work.
The day needs a solid structure, says Deuschle and customer.
People needed to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with natives and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So there are also administrations and honoraries in this area.
It is vital that refugees get the feeling that they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.
You have to explain to the refugees that it will take a while and they can bridge the time meaningfully, for example, with language courses.
Whoever develops the feeling can never help anyone in Urbach, must not work and be useless, which will never integrate.
The clear majority was motivated.
But there are also cases of problems, says Customer honestly, "People who are not at all". Therefore, the work of Deuschle and Customer is always to motivate others.
That's all a mom job.
A difficult question: Are the two of them afraid of radicalisation after the recent arrivals, even in a small town like Urbach?
"No," says Regina Kunde quite clearly, "what some naive may call it." A risk can and will not exclude them.
But the helpers are already sensitive.
These incidents are also the subject of refugees.
They were afraid that the assassins would bring them to a complete end.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regina Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
In this way, local and regional officials need to look at activities.
They always have the background that a new blow to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, the policy is changing.
Actually, it's unfair to place them on site.
"In Urbach we have not yet arrived where we can," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Kunde also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already out of the way to integrate the people so far.
These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they have to be helped, both women agree.
The political world is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schnordörf: Breakers with Hubschrauber Search
For about an hour, the policeman flew out of several areas without success.
Two unknown men were forced into an apartment in a multifamily house in Lindenweg on Friday morning at 8.50 a.m.
The resident surprised the two and struck the unrest into flight.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, both brought bluejeans and black capuzen pullis.
They ran toward the city center.
For arrest, the police put in several strip crews as well as a police scratcher.
The arrest was unsuccessful.
If possible, the unknown came close to the apartment in front of the fact, or when they fled.
