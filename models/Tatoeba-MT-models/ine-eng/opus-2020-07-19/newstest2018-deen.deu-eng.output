Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A wrong institution where young people are supposed to meet today.
A burial chapel, where it is now buried for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small farmers manage the one-off reason of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories for days.
It gets nervous if land maps aren't up to date.
Everyone knows this because the car-navi showed a green grass instead of a road.
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas, an offer of the Geoportal Bavarian government, are all different than current - but that is why they are very exclusive.
Especially when compared to current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the München Merkur area have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a flip-floor that is not recognized as such.
In the large map, more detailed maps, called Urposition Sheets, were included for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bavarian Measurements Administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originated from the first Bavarian Measurements.
Her client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bayern since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and gave a topographical recording of Bayern in order - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801: It was the present neighbors who created the idea of a covered Bavarian map.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Measurement Management.
The Urposition Sheet for Munich dates from 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian Landesbibliothek.
The comparison of early today is the most impressive example of the capital of the country.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Sensing, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was named 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877, as Munich City Hall.
Today, I'm sending in the middle of the city.
The Houses of Dissendings focus around 1856 along the today's Plinganserstraße, which was first named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the revolt of the Bavarian farmers against Austria 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, nothing can be seen as a field - at first glance: When you zoom in, a smaller map appears with dozens of lines and numbers: handwrittenly numbered floats from the so-called "reception", from which the land tax has been deducted.
There are no farmers there today - but small farmers of the plant "Land in Sun".
A large green area is located north of the consignor.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810, was actually still a grass - and no concrete desert in the 19th century.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt you can read not only the street name "at the gasteig" or the height "at the air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße, people were once locked up with vague ideas.
In 1858/59 the Munich Kreis-Irenastalt "Auf der Auer Füften" was created.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - the psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwigs II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the polling of the so-called errors.
He also prevented staff from resorting to violence against the people," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of The Hague Museum, who has been involved in an exhibition with the institution.
For 280 patients there was first room, later extended to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity is no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the church institution in Haar 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper clinic München-East has been one of Germany's largest psychiatry.
At the area of the former Auerstalt, young people are now meeting in Munich Salesianum.
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with training companies.
Western is the football site of the TSV Munich East, east of the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in an architectural application to the construction of the Irenanstalt, which was destroyed in the Second World War in bombings.
The Marienplatz was named "Main Square" in 1856, which was called the "Buying Gasse".
The Second World War also brought about a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
In December 1944, the Allied bombs took many holes into the city.
A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a mining chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where these days the preparations and on April 5, 2017 the spatenstics are held for the second S-Bahn strain line.
With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared to today's air picture - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Citizens' rights group published travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colorings has issued a warning for colouring people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the State.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travellers, visitors and Missouriians to pay particular attention to travel by the State and to exercise extreme caution, as a number of worthy, racial-based incidents have recently occurred and are observed in the entire state," the Group's opinion says.
A recently adopted Missouri law, which makes it harder for people to overcome discrimination, as well as the criminal prosecution authorities of the State, which aim disproportionately at minorities, encourage the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"They have violations of citizens' rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are killed or killed," said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group quoted events such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under dubious circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no gas during the trip by the State and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The Council also points to a recently published report from the Office of the Attorney General of Missouri showing that black drivers in the state are kept 75 percent more than white.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be ready to bring bail or let their relatives know that they are travelling through the state."
Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report programme, which classified the State in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country.
The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to appeal to a company because of housing or employment discrimination.
In the past, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had passed immigration laws requiring the local criminal prosecution authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which, in the opinion of the ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Weidezaun project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.
The CDU agents Peter White and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on site.
At the Shwendemann family court, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schundemann first gave insights into his business, in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provides 40 dairy cows and also provides many young animals and accommodates guests in five apartments.
The "Black Forest Milk" is for him the alternative way of marketing for the milk of his cows, as Schwendenmann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes only regional.
Since he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he called the Weidezaun project "an important element".
I can't make a winning economy on such steep surfaces.
The greenland area provides a lot of work, much needs to be done with the engine sense.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," Schwendemann stressed.
In 2003, he took over parenting and managed this without chemical plant protection and pests, even if he did not conduct a bio-operation.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the Weidezaun project and is happy about the leadership."
At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers had to be supported.
It is hoped that this could lead to the development of the areas for a long time.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they will continue their business," stressed the mayor.
Farmers are often criticized for promoting
A total of 25 parceles of eleven participants were incarcerated in 2013.
The opening area shall be 40 hectares, which shall not be opened until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71,500 euros, half of it was funded via Leader, a quarter of it was borne by the municipality of Fischerbach.
So the farmers stayed at 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of weidezaun.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the teeth," Schwendenmann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You do a good job without farmers and rural women".
Peter White also said: "Here are the best food produced."
The Baden-Württemberg Landscape Board (LPR) enables the public support of Weidezäunen.
The aim is to keep the black forest open.
The requirement is that the presence of a funding clause designated by the LPR.
Furthermore, the area to be joined must not be manageable (up to 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by deforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaun project 2018, the application of eight participants is currently running with 24 parceles, who want to build just 16 kilometres of Zaun.
The opening area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than EUR 112,000.
Is nothing more sacred?
Now the White House of Trump takes over the status of freedom
The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.
The Americans appreciate these as well as any other – therefore the carefully staged storm Saddam Husseins at the Firdo Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic accent in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the president's proposals for drastic restrictions on legal immigration with the status of freedom.
To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty-imitators would have lit him if he had done it.
But he grasped its importance, and in particular the importance attached to it, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.
When Miller Acosta complained, "I don't want to go into a complete story here, but the state of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem to which you refer, which was later added and is not part of the original rule of freedom."
Miller is really right, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus' dying words, the only one in which a state not only invites some old immigrants, but the poor of the poor: "Your fatigues, your arms, / your troubled masses, who see themselves then, breathe freely, / the sad waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "sudden waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump's USA were not welcome.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: in fact, it is a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they were carrying out a highly political action.
The sculpture should show the links between French and American republicanism by representing the female corporalization of freedom in a decommissioned classical imagery.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And they have a very different name: the mother of the exiles.
The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a humiliating attack on American Nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.
The great scream Rush Limbuugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Freedom did not invite anyone, but rather was an early neoconservative that brought the American flame into the uninhabited world: "Lady Liberty goes on.
It is intended to carry the fact of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.
The spell is not supposed to brighten the way to the United States."
It's quite unusual that Limbuugh was hit by something here.
The importance of the statue is quite a question of the position of perception.
The great fantastic act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, sad, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships.
It is in the real sense to see the world from the perspective of people looking for refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.
And of course that's not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever like to recognize.
Their spells should not light the way, but burn the hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Elid Doyle remembers a time when only two shots belonged to the UK team
The executive director of the UK Light Athletes, Neil Black, says that the 16-chap Scottish contingent in the World Championships Box "will make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "it develops something special in Scotland" and that the United Kingdom's lightweight athletics must learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," Black said.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they've done.
British Light Athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medalists, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will be attacked against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000m route, while Elid Doyle was elected by the team to the team captain.
"Eilid is quite modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," Black says.
"A number of athletes, regardless of whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or practice, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Elid naturally brought were great."
The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner, who will take place at the 400m-herds in her fifth world championships, says that it is "incredulous" that 16 shots are in the British team.
So far, Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The middle runner Muir is leading this way and has set up five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1500 m and the 5,000 m running.
Chris O'Hare, which runs 1,500 m, is another shot that should be observed after a great season that included the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when she was the only other shooter on team Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team says that they are "extremely proud" of the fact that many of their countrymen not only belong to the team, but in some cases they are also involved in the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me, makes it something very special for me," she added.
"I'm obviously very proud of all the shots that belong to the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb the podium.
What about my speech as a captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it'll just be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Do not run for a public office if you cannot delay the burning of voters
Our country's father knew something about bad news.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything, from internal politics to his political principles.
He cheated on the criticism, I'm sure.
But he did not bring his critics to silence.
Because in 1783 Washington said: "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and stupid, we will be led like the sheep to battle."
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of this beginning of the week.
The Governor's staff dismissed the complaint as free, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," said many people.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican Governor in a overwhelming democratic state, which is an amazingly popular one.
He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan's not a reactionary hothead.
He showed a firm hand in leading his state and strict respect for the principles.
He was also very good at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and playing his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the governor's side - which is a public forum that is officially designated and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesman Amelia Chase defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who are pushing the peitsch online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And they are only real people who speak to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a pastor, not a troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profan.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not filled with hate, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment area of the message "The Post".
"I don't appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a position on the same topic, then they will be ignored by some rather than a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's employees call "concentrated spam attack" would probably be called "prejudice".
The Facebook era makes it easy to add a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past, if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical leads or arrest demonstrators and bring them to silence.
But that's exactly what happens digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for slandering Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this issue was last week in Virginia.
The president of the Board of Supervisors of the Louduun County violated the First Amendment, according to US District Director James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous writers applied to his leadership.
And even then Washington had an anonymous trolley.
People who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", wrote all letters to newspapers that undermine Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with the United Kingdom violated his office, according to the historical documents collected from the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he didn't bring her to silence.
Freedom of speech, differences of opinion and discourses are the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will hold the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, which led near the Archerfield Links last year to the end before he lost against Paul Eales, is connected with the new site and functions as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the association founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how it reaches its fame with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great state.
Jerry did a great job when he found this place.
He is a jealous advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great window for this course."
The English Eales is pleased to defend a championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"This really feels special," said the player in Southport.
"I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it.
Back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returned to action on home ground.
This event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburg.
"You want to do well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing it again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm happy about how it went so far."
With the Trio in the field, the former Masters-victor Ian Woosnam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty are the former champions.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrence are among the six shots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free, the parking space costs £5 per car with one seat and £10 per car with two or more seats.
All survivors go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Less lung cancer due to passovers
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died from lung cancer.
This results in a study by scientists at the University of Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer cases are due to passive seizures per year," said Heiko Becher, head of study.
In comparison, he conducted his own study on this subject in 1994.
At that time, there were still 400 lung cancers due to pass-overs per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections prove to be very complex
The construction works in the Village Street are in full swing and are "somehow in time", says the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze.
In the area of household connections, the situation is more complicated than expected, as in the background much is hidden, which is not found in the plans.
Transport, which constantly hinders construction, is a major problem for the construction of the company Stumpp.
"The ignore of the drivers from red lamps and extinguishers is already huge," Heinze reports.
The road is blocked and only the line buses are entitled to travel.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been busy working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were already very exciting.
But luckily, we were provided by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in Indonesian goldland
If Bardina Degei cooks the dinner, she doesn't use a herd.
She rarely even uses a hat.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Panai Regency in the restless Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally called "note" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the cooled knot will be taken and swallowed with yellow, unwashed hands.
Degei is sitting on the wooden floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, such as washing clothes with turquoise water from the nearby soup.
An egg in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, she was not assigned a field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, it can be dangerous to work late: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are the soldiers here.
"No one's waiting to walk around the village after 5:00," she says.
It is a rare insight into daily life in the Highland of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was taken up in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders should vote by public handover before the occupation troops.
An existing movement that affected independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003 the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, while the independent part of Papua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is in the desert. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from Jayapura Province to Nabira and then a 5-hour drive with the car hire.
There is no public transport.
The city with approximately 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo bays and well-painted roofs transformed by rust into different yellow brown tones.
Only very few Indonesians have made their trip here, because journalists and virtually no foreigners have hesitated.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans honored a God named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wearing this dress," says Degei and shows on her lively, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and her bright dress.
"Before we had only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grassberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Panai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has demolished the value of $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has valuable wood resources worth $78 billion.
However, these wealthiers are a source of misery for the Papua, which ensures that Indonesia's powerful military retains a stifling presence.
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid almost 20 million US dollars to a single officer from 1998 to 2004.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gans and are treated unhappily.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Popes have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and arrested by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua New Guinea in the 1970s were committed to genocide by the Asian Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We Will Lose Everything" means in a 2016 report of the Erzdiosis Brisbane, which contains reports on the horrors of the previous year, such as illegal attitudes and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims, as events happen every week," says Andreas Harrisono, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have strengthened, as Papua's resources bring a flood of natives from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development changes as Muslim economic migrants come from the rich islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warning Canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, a mixed vegetable served with groundnut sauce.
Local people are fighting to stay here.
"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Panai-Homer, who moved to Jayapura Province City to work.
"It cost the native Papua - the mother [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokovi, promised to address the inequalities and legal violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Panai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua, there has been little change, and today the natives feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, Panai is only two months after Jokow's dedication in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp fire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them that they should turn their lights on.
One of the soldiers attacked her tone and later came back with four soldiers, so local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk, hunted and beat the group with their rifles, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers set fire to the children's group.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set in fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Pappua men, women and children gathered at a football site in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - running in the circle and imitating a bird song - by Papua Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators started slamming stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, an internal radio command was sent to the soldiers: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," says an official document by TIME, which has not been released to the local media.
Jeremies Kayame, 56, head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for rest and asked the crowd to return home.
No one was listening in the mood.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who's fired, but says the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overcrowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The native man Alfius Youw was struck three times, so his cousin was the witness of the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was," said John, who like many Indonesians bears only one name, the TIME in a dark mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The Chief Inspector of the Pappua Police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers wanted to "safe" their station because they were attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the spokesperson of the Papuan Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many others injured.
News of the killings came only on the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.
For three weeks, Jokowi in Jayapura gave a passionate speech, expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and swearing to address the historical misconceptions in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately, so it will no longer happen in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he had set up an extrajudicial mechanism to address historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to dealing with these violations, but there are processes that have to go through," he said.
Then Wirtano withdrew when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5th and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "Everything will be regulated by law."
Viranto, who accused the UN of "crime against humanity", who demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence vote of 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been committed, including the Pania incident.
The families of the Panai victims took up such claims with fierce disbelief.
"I was interviewed four times in the last three years, but there was no progress," says John.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people in Panai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shootings didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniais neighbourhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between village residents and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring an unconscious man into the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drunk when he was fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Enraged villagers protested before the company's local office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing fires.
But natives say the mobile brigade (indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killing one.
"We were so in panic, we were afraid that there would be a crack," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lived near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here, so the TIME.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the accountability of the officials involved and for the removal of the police's mobile brigade from the area.
Panai was always an unrester for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the dissatisfaction of the family members of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by attacking sporadic attacks and kidnappings by Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Panai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a response to this, thousands of people in Panai have been arrested and voluntarily taken into custody in the past years, under the pretext of the "safety of national sovereignty".
Some never wake up again.
Among the people in Papua Panai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for natives.
Bread is just as far away from reach.
People here build on everything they eat: above all note and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
You keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
In the course of time, economic inequalities between the domestic Papua and the new migrants have grown, which have reached a larger number since the opening of new flights to the airport of Nabire.
The few jobs there are in the region usually go to the better educated and well-being migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or the necessary skills to run its own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, president of the Panai Family Council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Moreover, restrictions on international media reporting remain strained.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim China, the Asia Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowis's campaign to lift the reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development has not been fulfilled.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia's restless eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: Visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of press controls means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "diversity and widespread injuries" in Papua, including the Panai Shire.
These same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The spokesperson of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir pointed out the Group's proposals and said in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to forget the evidence for human rights cases."
People on the spot want more foreign governments to know about this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the leadership of the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura, visited on 4 May, locals broke their silence and harassed him "We want freedom", according to a source that also participated in the meeting, but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papua says they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Panai shoots," says Gobai, president of the Family Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Panai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a thief, are in poor educational and health services.
Gobai says that the Panai people, like other Papua, consider their voice to be a "guilt" that he needs to repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and threats, the Pani-Schuffers' families carried out a last symbolic act of pride: the body of a victim was buried on a site precisely in front of the police and the military station.
They know that justice may never come to them, but at least they let the perpetrators not forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with a reduced head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures the 'Torch' cloud cracker from Dubai for the second time
On Friday, a fire found in one of the world's highest residential towers in Dubai its gateway and forced hundreds of residents, from the 337 meters high, to flee 79-storey buildings.
It is the second fire, which is run through the high house in just two years, which is randomly called the Torch Tower (Fackel Tower).
The building was evacuated, no damage was reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept, and we woke up at the fire alarm and when people screamed.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said a resident who named George, Reuters.
Dubai Civil Protection authorities said that the fire fighting units at 4.00 p.m. Local time (0.00 p.m. GMT) had removed the fire and cooled the building.
The government said it was working to provide accommodation for the people concerned.
The event can raise questions about the security of materials used in external areas of high houses around the world.
A survey of the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 showed that most of the damage from the clothing, the external clothing for decoration or insulation came.
In Britain, the police said that they believed that the system of plates for insulation and wear at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid expansion of a fire in which about 80 people died.
No Davis-Cup reform: Next Best-of-five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has attended the General Assembly with his great Davis Cup Cup.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis-Cup single was not supported by the two-thirds majority, but also by two-thirds.
The very long, but therefore also highly estimated five-satet classics remain to be awarded to the traditional competition.
63.54% of the Member States agreed on the reform, and the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was therefore barely missed.
"We respect this decision, but we are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," Haggerty said.
You will continue to work to improve applications.
It was not until after many objections that the proposal had been put to the vote that the finals should be drawn up in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only relatively smaller details: thus the finalists in Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the first round in the coming year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in training places etc. are facilitated and the players will have to complete less official media terms before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US passengers bring prohibited items to the aircraft, find an inquiry
A survey of air passengers showed that more than 20 percent of prohibited items are deliberately or unintentionally smuggled past the checkpoints of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent of those entering the aircraft, while they are accidentally carrying prohibited fairs or other items with bells.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had discovered later that they were traveling in vain with guns, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - performed by a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers were rather missing the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had deliberately tried to fly with something forbidden by the TSA, 19.7 percent of the millennials were compared to less than 15 percent of the X-generation members.
The most common items that were deliberately passed on to TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent added to significantly carrying items with knives through the safety check, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had brought intentionally prohibited drugs to the aircraft.
The company said it asked travelers across the country to find out how many accidentally brought smuggled goods through airport security and how many had done so deliberately.
It is no surprise that the people who are the first smugglers - significantly or invisibly - carry through the security of those who were most often flying.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain about what liquids they can carry or how much.
It is no surprise, then, that the largest amount of liquids seized by the TSA is prohibited.
For a long time, people thought that TSA could view books as jewelry.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't matter: Ten thousand Tesla customers cancel order
Elon Musk is happy to present with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has so far suggested that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-changing figures on sales increases and even more huge paragraphs, Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has for the first time betrayed another, less shiny number: the cancellations in the new mass market model 3.
Musk had often spent over 500,000 pre-orders for the new car in the past months, the delivery of which began right away.
Now muscle is empty: Of the total 518.000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is only non-binding reservations.
In the event of cancellation, Tesla fully repays the 1000 Euro (in the United States of America 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds) "Reservation deposit".
At present, 455,000 such non-binding reservations are available, spaced muscle in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge of ambitious growth targets is not the demand, but on the production side.
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
2018 is expected to be - all models combined - 500,000, 2020 a million.
The request for this is obvious.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 bookings per day.
Whoever orders a "Model 3" today can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla can do it, its brand new, never in practice tested production routes without major interruptions with maximum relief.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are more delays, then the incompatibility of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent unsatisfied customers from going to chess.
EPA Chief Pruitt withdraws due to the withdrawal of Obama-Era rules to reduce emissions
One day, after being accused by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Authority, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce emissions of smog causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency demonstrated the needs of the state environmental authorities towards faster reactions than previous administrations.
He did not mention the complaint brought against his former office in a Federal Appeals Court.
It is about a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to meet the 2015 standards for ground-nut ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would be extraditing compliance in a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "uncircumulating in local decisions or preventing economic growth".
Pruitt, who was President Donald Trump's State Prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment, was for a long time a trusted opposer of stricter environmental protection regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that are opposed by the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry.
The sudden return from Wednesday is the latest legal reverse for Pruitt's regulatory Rollback Agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator had exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama's administration, the oil and gas companies committed to monitoring and reducing metals.
In an opinion published on the Wednesday morning, Pruitt proposed that his return to Ozone standards simply reinforce the EPA's willingness to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely implementation of the new standards.
"In previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then expected to be charged by groups of activists and others, and in agreement to set the deadline for implementation," Pruitt said, who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in regulation through judicial procedures, and we take time seriously.
We also take the law and authority that gives us seriously."
Nevertheless, the EPA opinion said that Pruitt will at some time use his "power to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules "based on a sound policy and the best available information".
The Republicans at the Congress insist on a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.
A draft legislation approved in the last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had accused the EPA this week, said that the group intended to maintain the legal pressure.
"The conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and those over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ground ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The emerging smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of the public health and environmental protection community enjoyed a surprising exchange of courses over Pruitts.
"It's disturbing how much pressure it takes to take this reasonable step from the air-protector who we're going to breathe," said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the ideological crossroads of the Trump government to offer themselves to environmental polluters and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius' Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a ceremony at 4.30 p.m. on Sunday.
Whether its idyllic location and a beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hilarius facility a popular place to stay.
The visitors of the sixth Benefiz series can be delighted by this powerful place.
The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have caused the friends and supporters of Tumlingen to worry about them.
Walter Martini points out, "It's a unique little village."
In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württemberg edition book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen and the Vogetti" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.
According to the decree, in the Tumlinger Berg, apart from the simple parish church, there was also a royal court, to which the church or the right of the patronage belonged and not reversed.
So there were also people there.
As illustrated by the description of the Freuddenstadt of 1858, in addition to the Lower Village and the Upper Village, which are still to be recognized today in the local image of Tumlingen, the "Berg" of the third, the ruling village corner of the village.
Old maps from the time around 1600 undermine these historical events.
The right of the patronage was derived from the right of the early Middle Ages to own the church.
A Lord who built, equipped and occupied a church with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.
This was linked to the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The size of the two splits at Christmas in 1673.
The newly created bells were released for the first time in 1692, but later had to be released in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648), the windows were locked and the bells were stolen.
The roof was empty.
In 1796, French troops were encamped near the church.
They broke out the office and church chairs and used them as fuel.
The rest of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof also served as the last place of rest for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuschurch was destroyed.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On the New Year's Eve in 1834, a storm broke into the church tower and half broke in.
To prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower tower that still exists today was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffig Renters" as successor to Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius plant.
On Sunday, 16 July, the friends and supporters of Tumlingen invited the 6th serenade to St. Hilariusskapelle at the old cemetery.
This is designed by the Combo of Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with the word contributions of Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks for the final word.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
The reception is from 3.30 p.m.
In the wake of the serenade there is a turning point in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view of the meadows to the forest," the organizers present the fantastic view.
The serenade only takes place in dry weather.
The organizers are looking forward to many supporters to receiving the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important to the Tumlingen and Earsweiler.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms.
The association wants to examine the approval of windmills.
"Boisheim resists" does not see any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Land Council.
The Boisheim Association has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the establishment of planned wind power plants in the Boisheim network.
She was lawless.
The association argues that no wind power plants could have been approved at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Net, since at the time of the fours only there was a wind power concentration zone at the city border at Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind energy plants are possible in principle, while the concentration zone also results in an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.
This zone is intended to prevent a "sparing" of the landscape.
Although the city of Foursen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim network a few days earlier by changing the area use plan, the district government had not approved Düsseldorf because of a form error.
"Because of the lack of planning legal condition, the consent granted is still illegal and therefore also withdrawing," said Christoph Erkens, president of "Boisheim resists".
Current state of affairs: The city council has again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim network before the summer break; approval of the district government is still in place.
Recognition: "This is why the granting of an authorisation for the establishment of wind power plants is legally excluded."
The circle confirms the entry of the call.
"The corresponding letters have been entered during the fourth round since last week," said one speaker.
The circle takes it to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not likely to lead to the termination of the procedure.
In view of the ongoing proceedings before the Administrative Court, on Thursday, the board did not wish to comment in substance on the arguments of the Boisheim Association.
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans on an area on the Boisheimer Nette the construction of four 200 meters high windmills.
Already last year, the company, in which the city of Foursen is directly involved, had concluded agreements with the owner of about 65 hectares of large land.
With the creation of the four wind power plants, the electricity demand is about 11 400 households, which corresponds to about one-fifth of the electricity demand of all 4 households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, the Foursen City Council provided green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in the Linnich Windpark at Aachen and for participation in a wind power plant in Öbach-Palenberg in Heinsberg district.
Car and tractor crashing together: woman dies in a terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwalmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-kreis).
A woman was killed.
Two other persons were slightly injured.
The road was closed for hours.
According to police reports, a 17-year-old woman from Bornich with her PKW was accompanied by L 333 towards Bogel as a companion with her 53-year-old mother.
City and dealer plan "home shops" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are going to discover the shopping opportunities in the city in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to lure the inhabitants to the shopping boom in the city centre.
As the president of the Business Association, Christian King, announced, the "home shops" weekend should make customers aware of what offers their own city apart from the usual supermarkets.
It is therefore planned to be a market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, domestic companies are expected to present themselves with their training sites.
In addition, the town's shops are to be invited to the "Maturday Shop".
The action is not only aimed at the inhabitants of the city and the nearest region.
In preparation, advertisements on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags pointing to the weekend of the event, Christian King.
The City Administration and Trade Association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
Thus, the trade association and the city go to another stage of the project "Attractive Inner City".
This includes new offers such as the first "Activ Day" at the fountain festival as well as sales Sunday, conversations with all business operators and hosts to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the discount on parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, the potential of customers is to be opened up again or again.
These include curators and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost their city when buying from the view.
In the end, everyone had to contribute to the city of the interior - up to the tenants, the businesses of the whole city and the associations.
It was applicable to overcome the lethargy that had spread in part with a network, the king had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Centre in Mühlhausen, shared that on the third day of "home shops" were participating for the first time in five Thuringian cities.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherrode.
The day is intended to "purchase for the value of local trade and demonstrate its importance for the common good of our cities", says Streich.
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that each citizen can influence its own direct environment with its purchasing behaviour.
Two deaths and several injuries after explosion at U.S. school
During construction, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine others were injured, some of them hard.
According to the firefight, on Wednesday (placetime) he was still a victim in critical condition.
A man died when a part of a school building exploded in the explosion.
A missing person was later also buried.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a result, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
At the time of the holiday, only a few people stood in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump put pressure on Mexico after secure transcripts of phone calls due to the payment of the border wall
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. president taunted him because he had publicly attacked the wall. According to reports, he said to him, "You can't tell the press that."
Trump began his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States, and he was unable to allow Mexico to pay for the project.
Transscripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed an intense exchange.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull said that a trade for the United States of refugees who emigrated to Australia was "laughing", "mies" and "mud" and that the existence on the trade that the Obama government had given him would make him look like a "depp" after he proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees into the United States.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he had said Mr. Turnbull, "this is the most unacceptable call for all day."
Moores Ford Massacker: Activists lead racist lynchact as a call for justice again
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of viewers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rushed to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, the bridge could reach, a group of white men with guns came out to block his way.
The leader of the Mobs - a middle-aged man in a needle - took a long train to his cigarette and looked through the wind protection disc.
Drinnen swooped in fear.
"We want this n----r Roger!" cried the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
Crying broke the silence when a young black man was crushed by the escort's seat.
Luckily, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22nd, is only one episode.
But when a snake is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience is very real suckers.
Since 2005, lawmakers have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to follow up the night, in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were guided by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
"It is really inconceivable that no one has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the organization of the succession.
"It's a dirty spot on a story, but it's a burden to our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifelong citizen lawyer.
For him, the legacy serves as a dramatic call to action and reminds the Monroe community of an annual reminder that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he said.
"We cannot attain salvation and reconciliation until we receive justice."
A medical doctor puts a bedcloth on the corpse of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynchen on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI records received from NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding graphs were suspected in the lynch process.
But no one was ever accused.
Although suspects have been on free foot for decades, citizens say that the dual motivation for the lynch-actions throughout the city has always been known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court allowed black citizens in Georgia to give their vote for the first time in the summer election.
At about the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcom had a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight down - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, as the FBI said.
He was taken to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they were away from prison and the Moore's Ford Bridge approached, a lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and arranged the murder," a FBI report concludes.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the murder, eliminated evidence and confused the identity of witnesses."
Brooks formulates it even more.
"It was a right-wing massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you are allowed to register and if you vote, this will happen to you here."
For almost a decade Cassandra Greene has led the annual recovery of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Its presentation is spectacular, interesting and is founded in a kind of deep racism, by which many would like to believe that it no longer exists in America.
It's hard to look and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the link, because then we're confronted with his madness in us all," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've done."
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, almost 30 actors – a dozen white and the rest of black – pushed themselves into a room and listened when Greene started a well-played overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is a Greenes co director.
He's been playing the role of the chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said.
"But I think it is very important to have this story in life because we do not want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The piece begins with Malcolm, the horse attacked and harassed him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n-- he, get away from my property!"
Rascona refers to the fire.
There's a break.
And every one of them will burst into laughter.
Green laughs the most.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still looking.
"I just don't think that white people said an-- he."
"Yes," exchanged one of the other black performers.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'."
And right there the energy moves in the room, a feeling of friendship replaces the discontent.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharp and repressive.
Absolutely nobody laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are shrieks, shots and then quiet.
A woman, dressed in mourning, stands over the bodies of the actors and carries out Billie Holidays mourning Lobrede "Strong Fruit".
Her voice breaks with every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it is a group of about four dozen spectators sweating and tears out of their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple from Ithaca, New York, drove to see the performance, many just come down the street.
They've all been experiencing a strong humidity for almost eight hours in Georgia when Brooks takes her on a pilgrimage to the graveyards of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
To this point, the murder remains an anecdotes, but now, when you stand in the same country where the Lynch murder took place, the air feels spensibly.
When the last notes of the song turn off, Greene invites the amount to come closer and inspect the body name.
Children hook up on their heads, register the fake blood and the quiet bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," muttered a little boy as he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the amount - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch seil and remove their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his associates and then tears in her arms, the emotional load of the performance breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know it's not in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience will meet with the actors for dinner.
On a table, a white couple from Atlanta are cheering up about the set-up with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski fought to find words that left the performance.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... come from people who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said.
"What really does this to me let me believe that the Lynchen is still going on," she added, "it's only today called police shooting."
In the same room Tyrone Brooks Hof keeps on his table, he eats and remembers the rights of citizens.
He said he's already started planning the show next year.
"The rendering is in a way inspiring, because it describes the fear of what we have brought, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It is so if we learn nothing from it, it can happen again.
Whoever doesn't study his own story, whoever doesn't know his own story, is doomed to repeat it."
The Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf is setting up a bon-free stage in front of a giant, six-story stage.
The rotational stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) is a scrupulous street corner as well as wall rest and danerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes-Oldtimer is parked in which the Rhenettötters pose as rock girls, or alternatively an isetta.
Stacked oil fibers remind Castorf's Leitmotiv - money, power and gear - that is drawn by his "ring" stage.
The three Rheintötters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as wonderful as already in the "Rheingold".
Kess leads them to Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), in Hollywood-Manier, tear down a body in the trunk and give the Krawallo-Clicke.
Stephen Milling sings the lovely cool garden surrounded by the aura of a weight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he strikes victory cold.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eichei) must also believe in it.
The audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and Principal Janowski, who are modest and handcuffed to the Merkel wheel, are celebrated.
There is a big deal for the festival orchestra, which is shown on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in military leisure clothing.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his team was excited.
If he had yet to have a valid pepper concert over him in 2013, there were five years later great joys in which the single "Buh" calls went under.
Captain Katharina Wagner may have been pleased about this.
"It is noted that the audience has grown up with the "ring" in a way," she had said shortly before the dpa performance.
The public not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it was also an understanding for its view.
I'm drawing a positive summary.
Max Quantity works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've been working at the school all day.
How are your experiences like that?
Quantity: It's a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to deal with different people, young people, refugees, young adults.
You're 26 years old now, so you're a late volunteer.
How's it going?
Quantity: I've made Abitur.
And then a building engineering study, let's say, successfully interrupted.
I recognized that it was wrong for me and I wanted to do something else to work with people.
And then I asked what you're doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is on the spot, perhaps at the focus, is real.
And that's it?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I'm going to start my study in social life in the winter semester.
I will study twice, probably in Jugendamt Herne a social worker training and study in Hamm at the university.
Is it not unusual to have several different places of use while volunteering?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
I guess it always comes to where you make your FSJ.
It can be done from old age to youth work - in all possible aspects of social work.
With me, it was very different.
I was also partly in the OGS, that is, in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly the right thing to do.
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really goes.
Other than in the engineering studio?
Quantity: Well, of course, here it's not about calculating statics.
You always have other people in mind who have a completely different history behind each other.
Whether a refugee, or a youth who has been taken out of the family - one must always look into it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any fear of contact?
Quantity: I'm not the type for that.
It's an area that has a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also some negative moments, but that's how life is.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividends to reinstate the business
On Friday, the British education group Pearson said that it would cut down another 3,000 jobs and cut its dividends by 72 per cent, as another restructuring programme would be launched to overcome the pressure facing the company.
The decommissioning announced mainly by Director-General John Fallon for the end of 2018 and early 2019 will also result in his previous restructuring, where 4,000 people had already lost.
In May, Pearson announced in a third cost reduction programme a cost reduction plan of another 300 million pounds (394 million US dollars) to revitalize a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning.
The company, which had sold its participation in Penguin Random House to the partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it reached an increase of 1 per cent in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Kabul's convoy attack: Nato soldier killed in a suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a soldier of the nato, and injured several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a statement of the Nato was given.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians died in the Qarabagh district.
Bombing is the last violence Afghanistan has experienced this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide killer killed two people near the Iraqi message in Kabul.
In a Nato opinion, the explosion occurred on Thursday night when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised bomb rate carried by persons".
The statement says that all the injured are in a stable state and are treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby bay.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1.662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On 31 May, a violent bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's most deadly militant attack, since 2001 the US-led troops forced the Taliban out of power.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump weighs on increasing the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicides in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, their policies, and especially in the name of President Ashraf Ghani in recent weeks.
EPA decides to delay the smog rule on complaints
The U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has decided to postpone the regulation of the Obama government, which states are obliged to freeze the emissions of smog-induced emissions, one day after 15 states complained to the agency for the move.
The EPA announced on Wednesday the decision to proceed with the so-called "Ozone Regulations 2015", and said it showed the Agency's commitment to cooperate with States.
"We believe in dialogue with and react to our state partners," said EPA Chief Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the intention of the EPA to measure the ozone conditions - in which some of the country's emissions of pollutants are to be measured to determine where cuts need to be made in order to comply with stricter air quality standards - to delay one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 most democratic states, together with the area of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to recover a wide range of environmental concerns raised by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda which, according to Trump, is intended to stifle economic growth.
However, efforts have triggered the return of the democracies and nature conservation groups, which are concerned about the effects of higher emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that the intake of air, the ozone, contains "reduce lung function and can enhance respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Community would like a common area
At the end, the decision was clear: in the case of two votes, the municipality of Fluorne-Winzeln decided to set up a Community space in the future old age facility.
Before the discussion there is an important information: the purchase contract for the missing property is signed, said Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will continue until the territory of the church community is in the community, there is no longer a planning barrier for the project to be approved by a private investor.
There is a debate on a Community area.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to oppose the community.
On the ground floor, he would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipality are required to provide for such a Community space not only as a meeting point for the residents of the old-age community, but openly into the community.
For example, the word "strickcafe" made the round.
The decision, which has already been decided on in the last autumn, will be slowed down by the possibility of funding for the current budget.
The building is located in the refurbishment area.
The establishment of a Community area, as reported by Tjaden, would be eligible for 60 per cent of 30 per cent.
The proposal for a decision is designed to signal to the investor that in this respect it is not intended to be thrown into a bond between the legs, the conclusion that both satellites - which is devoted to environmental construction - as well as pultdach - would be possible, which reduces the plant height and makes the construction more economical.
Needless to say, not only does Wilfried Sohmer mean this supplement.
If it's helpful, he's going to pass the groceries on his own.
This is not so easy for the Community.
Daniela Call refers to the many own buildings with which you do not get so far, for which you now deny yourself in the community room from the window, she says, "I am making it difficult for me to do so."
Yvonne Staiger speaks out for the Community space - however, absolutely against a municipal participation.
It then sees a hidden subsidy to potential or even outside investors.
That is not the case, because the acquisition of the area does not provide an allowance, but it is a genuine, marketable counter-value, in the event of doubt, the opposite is the case.
There are three advocates in favour of the application to split the proposal for a decision accordingly.
That is how two votes remain in the original programme, which Stefan Haller sums up: "If we take this decision, we will take a huge step towards closing a huge accident in our infrastructure."
Collision with car: Wheeler is dragged on the road
When crossing the road, an 82-year-old biker was picked up in Garath on Wednesday by a car and seriously injured.
As the police reported, the 82-year-old Langenfelder was on the way with his bike on the road of the Black Road from Hilden.
The senior wanted to cross the road along the road At the Buchholzer Busch.
A guide driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelds drove on the road, however, he apparently did not pay attention to the traffic.
He was with a car that controlled a 66-year-old Hildenerin.
The man was dragged to the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital by a ambulance.
FC Bayern Munich must abandon David Alabama and Thiago in the supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without it: David Alabama has to let the game go against Dortmund.
With personal care, the FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first time in the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the Pocal winner.
The staffing of the German football record master Bayern Munich will be increasing before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30/ZDF and Eurosport) at Pokalsieger Borussia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also ignore David Alabama in duel with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
In addition, the Munichans Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boaeng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the past six test games, Ancelotti has made the physical state and the missing balance in the game of his team.
"We know that we are not in the best physical constitution," said Ancelotti and added: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn't good lately."
The 58-year-old, however, believes in an increase in performance in the first official performance of the season.
" Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team's ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "hard, intense game".
The duel of the two German football weights draws the fans into their band.
The party was sold with 81,360 spectators, the Deutsche Football Liga (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walk in the resin of stars to stars
In Harz, the first "star path" is to be created in the Federal Republic of Germany.
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planet trail in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" is contrary to the need for information from many Harz visitors, it said.
It combines nature, science, movement and sports performance.
The members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and star images.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "very affordable installations in five to six locations" in Oberharz.
Inquiries came from St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Highgeite and Sieber.
The information on the tables should be supplemented via the Internet.
This is why a good mobile reception plays a role in the selection of locations.
Freedom of access is also a criterion.
Later the star path will be extended by train.
"On the star path, the viewers learn a lot of knowledge, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
They also learned why stars had different colors or why one star was brighter than another, although he was considerably further away.
It will also be communicated in which star picture is a selected star and when it is best to see it.
Since 2014, the association has been operating in the mountains of St. Andreasberg, the highest value in Northern Germany.
The location in the heart of the National Park Harz, according to information from the Federal Nature Protection Office, is among the six darkest regions in Germany.
From there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy are often visible with a simple eye.
In the Uni-City there is something similar to the planned constellation - the planet path on the initiative of the Association of Planetarium Göttingen since 2003.
Starting at Gebhard's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planet's path leads up to the Hainberg and the Star War - as well as an "outerworld" location in Diemarden (Jemende Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
Stealings with the individual planets - including the pluto degraded to the twin planet at the end - are exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth thus shrinks to a ball of 6.5 millimetres diameter, while the exact sun, 75 meters away, still measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet's path is good four kilometers.
While light from the sun to the Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to stand with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in the world room.
The march to the next fix star would take another half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, to Garcia, the unbeatable World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion, the flur went down to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super-Federal Weight Champion.
After Garcia's victory, by unanimous decision on the former Four-Division World Master Adrien Broner on Saturday on showtime, both fighters are members of the Top Five Pounds for Pounds list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
I wish you a lot of luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the couple posted for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect size order".
"I am a former spring weight," Garcia recalled.
"I'm up for Broner [at 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to light weight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let us give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Climate asked whether it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year in order to agree a date with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) that also has an interest in the fight against the winners of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for it," Garcia said and later expressed himself openly to fight the network offering the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready ..."
Garcia said he estimates Lomachenko as "a huge fighter", and he may participate in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko kept up with the generous praise for Garcia and said he thought that the triangular champion from Riverside looked very slowly, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the Ko-Out.
Garcia said the focus is to show the impact, then boxing.
They both said they could feel the moment that was built up for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that must be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I am more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighter, and that's Mikey.
It'll be a great fight."
Four injured by tires
In case of an A7 accident, four persons were injured in part on Thursday afternoon.
According to the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle shortly before the point of connection.
The pkw turned right into the booklet, where he crossed and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four satisants - two adults and two children - were partially injured in the accident.
During the first delivery of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was blocked north for about an hour, followed by traffic on the left lane at the accident site.
Fortunes Hoffmann: "Drier chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2:2 the season up against Braunschweig that the optimization of the resistance formation will lead to Aue points.
With the first season, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result too, there would not have been the two opponents at 2:2 against the brougham.
"These were two opponents too much, and we need to take better care of them in Aue," says the opponent of Fortune Düsseldorf.
In the Erzberge, the triier chain is also to be further optimized.
And a door after a break, the Fortunes don't want to catch up anymore.
"For the future it will be so that no one will stand on the line next to Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better qualified after the experience in preparing with the trier chain than with the quadrer chain.
"I still don't know how we're going to act in the eye," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "because we have players who can build well in the trier chain on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann," Hoffmann said.
"The prerequisite is, however, that we are even better at harmonizing and we do not make so many playback errors in the building."
Of course, Hoffmann also leads to Aue to win the game.
"If one can speak after an inconsistencies from a wrong start, he doesn't know.
The performance could be quite okay," Hoffmann said.
"But if we stand there on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the podium, we will certainly be able to talk about a proper seasonal upturn."
His coach didn't want to know anything about it.
"The start of the season is only after six to eight days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak for an advantage over the eye, just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be interrupted because of a storm.
"Now they can start the season almost with a home game," Funkel and Hoffmann said that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher, as they did not have a heavy and complete game like Fortune against a favorite rise in the bones.
"But they don't know 100 percent where they're currently," says the Fortuna Interior Defender.
Although the guests from the Rhineland go as a lightest favorite on Sunday to meet at the final (fast) stadium of Aue.
"That we take them away, only because we have the claim to come under the first six, is Bloodsinn," says Funkel, whose balance in only one defeat against Aue from nine games is completely positive.
"There is no team in the second federal league, which must be beaten from the front," explains Fortunes Chefcoach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and excessive."
And so Funkel doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish Asylum Assessment Test published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method for medical evaluation of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years old. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish authorities for Forensic Medicine (Jätsmedicinalverket) began to carry out the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they should make the assessment of the age more accurate after the Swedish Migration Authority (Emigrant Code) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, 6,880 were sent to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the time of mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "maybe 18 or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "maybe under 18 years of age".
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent in the past few months.
"We don't see any big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are quite constant," he said in The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged as over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases that "suggest that the investigated person was 18 years old or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results published in 581, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-ray recordings of wisdom plates and MRT recordings of knee joints, then analysed by dentists and radiologists, were also criticised in a number of areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of human biological tires to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
To evaluate the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't do as much as we could," he said to the Metro newspaper.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of a child being misjudged as adults is low.
The biggest risk lies when the person is barely under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent."
Full Plan
The work on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is well advanced.
On Wednesday, a 7-ton part of the heavy concrete was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Licht, Bauleiter at the Department of Roads and Transport in the Government Bureau of Freiburg.
At the same time, in April, the work began on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The building site is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the timetable will be respected.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads through the Trombach.
It is a concrete rolling arc bridge that is covered with red concrete and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly repaired.
The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They're made of red stone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1,30 metres wide on the north side in the middle of the morning and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is a border anchorage which is also used as an operating route.
On the south side of the bridge is to be used on Friday a 2.20 m wide bridge cap.
It is then to be followed by the pedestrian.
The special thing is that it is part of manufacturing, a patent of Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
Special feeling of fingertips has called for the release of pipelines through the construction in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a glass fiber cable attached to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed in advance of the work by handbook about the project.
In addition, fish and crustaceans had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the building and the Assembly Hall in direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a lamp.
For the construction work at the bridge at the Lauterbacher village entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannhof" and "Sieben Linden" is fully blocked.
The cost of the three bridges is EUR 700 000.
The whole country is funded.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest with German potato salad
It is not so often that parties draw on a string, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), what else is difficult to bring under a hat comes together.
The parties represented in the Kreistag Volkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left) are part of a broad alliance, which on this day shows a peaceful flag, because the AFD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites the poster "great election campaign".
And famous names begin - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24th, and the Deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AFD students, but demonstrate.
The motto "The Eiffel remains."
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "All on a table" on the well, but is now taking place at the park below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colourful picture that's available there.
And what Christa Karoli, president of the Forum A world and one of the major organizers, is quite happy: "Greatly how many people have come together here."
There is music and every amount of food, including a "urdeutsche cartoffel salad which could also eat AFD without problems", says the woman who brought it.
The police have ordered many officers to go to Gerolstein, and it shows the presence at the train station, which is only a few metres away from the venues.
How did the AFD actually get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes reports from the AFD Volcanoeil, he has been working on such an event and has received the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun, but there was a discount because of the already built Laurentius farms there were not enough parking spaces.
Well, the rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here."
With a view to the event at the rondell foreplay, he says: "This is the good right of people, the main thing, it remains peaceful".
The same is true: At 20 o'clock, on the round floor, there is a band for entertainment, in the town hall of various speakers, including the Rhineland-Pfalzic AfD chairman Uwe Young.
In the hall are about 200 listeners who expect the top candidate for the federal election, Alice Weidel, and the Federal Vice-President Beatrix of Storch to hold their talks.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
A little more than an hour lasts the AfD event, the guests on the ground floor have a longer breath, but also there it is said to be clean after 21 hours.
The police can suppress - no special events.
Trompete Trompete Trompete Posaune
A resurgence with the Wolfe Posaunist Frederic Belli there is in the series Haslacher monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 20 o'clock in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he plays a concert under the motto "Black Sea Meets Black Forest", or also "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German training with roots in the blast music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchestras.
This is how Petkov Solotrompeter is the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederick Belli is a soloosaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both unite the desire not only to exceed the limits on their instruments, but also to blend the boundaries of the different genres.
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach joins the two as in a new fight, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" of jazz award winner Nils Wgram, classics, jazz and the free play are mixed into a fascinating work of art.
This core part of the programme was launched only this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it specifically for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher Monasterkirche with its special acoustics will be included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything," says Kristen Stewart openly about her bisexuality.
"When I bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh, that was cool, what's next?'
The most well-known relationship of the Hollywood star was that of her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who finally became bitterly separated.
Nevertheless, the brown performer assures against the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was in love with everyone I've dated.
Or do you think I would have played it?"
After her separation, Christians admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived and seriously believed in dualism.
So it's never bothered me or prevented me.
I just never wanted to be taken seriously."
Especially among them, she said, "Bang Showbiz" but in school time, when she preferred to dress like a drum: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I'd look like a bug.
I really felt attacked, frightened, and embarrassed.
Now I look back and think to myself, 'Girl, be proud of you!'
Especially to the public, they do not like to say their love: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that upsets me.
And maybe some call me unappreciable, but I don't like to have to justify myself before the whole public."
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he is changing the party
The democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday evening at a announcement with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have gone away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and thoughts ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I cannot help you any more if I am a democratic governor."
The news broke out in jubel.
"In the morning I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump previously promised a great announcement at the West Virginia Rallye.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, according to Forbes, the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes finds that he owns coal mines in five states, and has inherited a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening, saying: "The change of the party of Governor Justice is another blow for a democratic party that would prevent us from working rather than making our country great again."
"With only 15 governments and the control of the smallest legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from above to below without leadership and is unable to find a positive, single message," RNC President Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian excuse for doping scandal
The world leader of lightweight athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious apology from Russia for a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be taken back into the sport.
Russia's Leader of Light Athletics Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the evening of the Light Athletics World Championships that the ban on his country from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all athletes who were taken away at the competition for gold and silver medals".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban, which was banned in November 2015 following a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) on State-funded doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told the reporters.
"The entire Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognized itself that it had experienced some pretty hot times and would do everything possible to ensure that the Federation was redesigned."
Coe said he was also "enjoyed" that Russia would accept the criteria for its re-introduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to re-use Russia," Coe said.
"We need to do everything in the coming months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupted system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will become neutral players at the Lite Athletics World Championships that start in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for re-setting.
Drug tests are still insufficient and banned trainers are still working free, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Traueract for soldiers destroyed in Mali
At a mourning party in the Nordic Fritzlar, about 1,000 people thought of the two soldiers killed in Mali during a helicopter crash.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the city of Dome under high security conditions.
For an unexplained reason, the defence minister Ursula of the Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
She referred to the two pilots who were killed as "the master of her profession".
"We refuse this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old staff chief from North Hessen were killed on Wednesday one week ago in West African Mali.
Her pain was transferred to Germany and accompanied on Thursday by a German army guard to the Fritzlar Dom Sankt Peter.
At noon only the members of the church were separated.
Then the mourning celebration began in the family circle, close friends, from representatives of the Federal Defence and politics.
Among these were Hessen's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Federal Defence Inspector Volker Wieker.
Trauer guests put roses down, the relatives stood arm in arm at the wounds.
Before the church, Fritzlars and many soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas wall.
The Minister of Defence of Leyen referred to the defeated soldiers as "highly decorated" and applied experiences.
The Chief of Staff has built up the air operations of the fighter tiger in Fritzlar and has been one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also stated: "If this occupation could not be avoided, it would not have been conquered".
No doubt at the UN mission in Mali, the minister of Leyen did not show: the use is dangerous.
But he was also of high importance "for a country from which we are separated only by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the pain was brought out of the dome.
When and where they are ordered, the German defence did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife.
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), will not be ordered next to his wife after his death.
This was shared by the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is added to the Domkirche of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already prepared a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with the decision of her husband, it was further stated in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried, it's still unclear.
But he did not intend to be involved in his French home.
Prince Henrik had never made a hill out of that he was not happy with his title.
After the throne of his wife, Margrethe, in 1972, would like to become king.
In 2016 he went to rest and also left the title "Prinzgemahl".
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not consider himself equal to his wife - not even after death, said Lene Balleby, the chief speaker of the Danish Royal House.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will finally be, it is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be involved in his French home, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's worked for in the last 50 years.
The native Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked on the subject in the French Embassy.
While his later wife was always fleeing the sympathy of the people, Prince Henrik had a difficult situation in his nearly 50-year reign in Denmark.
In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "Just a few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticised.
My Danish was swinging, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk waste instead of steaks, lemon instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, which I smoked instead of Virginia-Tabak, and who in this country had the call to be the brand of society-critical intellectuals, I couldn't hope to survive.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
That was the same two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants a quick new choice
CDU and FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony
President Stephan Weil (SPD) of the Netherlands is not returning after the loss of the red-green majority of the government for a rapid re-election of the country day.
Because on Friday, he spoke for the resolution of Parliament.
In the past, the surprising withdrawal of a Green-Deputy from her rural group in Lower Saxony had shaken the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the country day election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its low-voting majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The previous Green Deputy Elke Tvesten justified her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her round of elections in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained in Hanover on Friday.
CDU fractional head Björn Thumler wants to recommend his group to take it.
Thus CDU and FDP together have 69 seats in the Low Saxony Landtag, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new land day is scheduled for 14 January next year.
Thumler said that the red-green country government should now decide whether to continue ruling in this situation without a majority.
However, Stephan Weil considers it essential that the land day decide its self-resolved solution as quickly as possible.
The CDU fraction is expected to decide on its follow-up on Tuesday.
The country constitution also foresees the possibility that the country day will draw the Prime Minister's confidence and select a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be legally examined clean," said Thumler.
"All questions will be discussed in peace if they are legally examined."
Thumler called Twesten's step "but something's wrong."
The politician himself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She became a member of the Black Green Party.
The Greens called on the debatable Members to return to their country-of-the-art mandate.
"We naturally assume that she will return her country day mandate to the Green Country List with immediate effect," said the presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The group president of the Green Anja Piel said: "We regret the decision of Elke Twesten extremely".
You have deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the Group.
"Even in the background that there were no substantive differences, we cannot follow this step."
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condemns the misconduct of the Lower-Saxon Green-Deputies Every Twest to the CDU as a traitor.
"The behaviour of the former Greens in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of voters, but also a betrayal of Red Greens," the Federal Chief of Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly re-elect the country's day.
The second-largest exit costs the majority in Niedersaxsen.
Politicians place their personal interests in front of the good of the country "in their insults and in their hunger," SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil criticised.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony joins and tries to beat political capital."
Niedersachsen CDU fractional chief Björn Thumler wants to recommend his MPs to include each of the tweets in the CDU.
The head of the SPD Group on the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, suggested that Twesten, with personal career memories, fake the outcome of the 2013 elections.
The CDU was then the strongest force before the SPD, but the SPD and Green had a thin majority of a voice in the day.
Minister for Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisons, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discusses tested eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in the interview with the editorial network of Germany (RND) speech and response.
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp.
At the Consumer Protection Portal www.Food Warning.de, the federal countries provide the latest information on the egg charges concerned.
The eggs concerned should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we know right now, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the supply - because the key role of the clearer is not really being achieved by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal countries.
Nevertheless, my house has been suddenly switched off and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany's concern.
All information and risk assessment are available to the consumer.
Trade has the same responsibility as the manufacturers to ensure that the products sold are transportable and health-free.
If the maximum residue level of 0,005 mg/kg is exceeded in eggs, they are not transportable.
Unloaded eggs, however, can be sold and consumed.
This time the companies are not to blame.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to the current level of knowledge, production companies do not incur direct debt.
However, they need to be counted on as a result of unfair practices of service companies with economic damage.
As always, there are too few controllers in the event of a serious accident.
Is there only a lack of staff or the key responsibility?
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the process.
However, it is also true that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100 per cent.
This is precisely why a consistent clarification of such events and the transfer to the public prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may occur are of crucial importance.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect an unfavourable explanation from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarm in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers and consumers have the right to obtain food exclusively safe and transportable.
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food business, consumers and consumers are correctly encouraged.
By means of the restricted means, manufacturers, traders and consumers have become in a situation which is absolutely unnecessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the behaviour of food-producing animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This must be done consistently at all levels and with high pressure.
I expect from all the competent authorities that the matter will be clarified promptly and indiscriminately.
How the financial rules of football on Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unhindered expenditure of the European Football Associations will not interfere with the transfer of Neymar's world record from Spanish Barcelona to French Saint Germain.
There will be some consequences for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the leading organisation that monitored the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair-play rules, which were launched by UEFA in 2011, mean that PSG must at some point prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without significant losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilians out of its contract, and Neymar will receive an amount of several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's transfer to France.
The PSG can certainly make money loose so that Neymar sign and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the power-rich family of Qatar.
Associations can spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but they have to counter legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as President of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that associations that had incurred enormous debts in their pursuit of success had effectively deceived and risked ruining themselves if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP withdrew from the concentration on the club's debts to monitor its losses.
The change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich originally in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher issue.
During the current three-year FFP settlement period, which runs until 2018, Clubs can incur losses of EUR 30 million.
And although Platini in 2015 has fallen by the presidency in Hungary, his UEFA successor, Alexander Ceferin, continues to try to deter excessive expenditure.
"Surely FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, compared to The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a scale, it can distribute the amount for the settlement of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the redemption amounts for the next five years can be set at EUR 44,4 million in the year-end.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has been hit by the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, who is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars) which was reduced to 20 million euros later - and it was arranged that the team members for the 2014/15 Championship League remain limited to 21 players instead of the other normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to list their financial supervision by raising their income by companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a Danish company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsorship was to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this as legitimate income.
That is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of sponsoring the PSA was raised by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar on payments made by the WM 2022.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar will become WM ambassadors and that such a manoeuvre could be easy to find for UEFA regulators.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more sensitive to any attempt to comply with the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke under the condition of the anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not competent to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16, with a turnover of 542.4 million euros, has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year still need to be published.
PSG expects Neymars to arrive a blessing for sponsoring deals, marketing and trikot sales.
The association is expected to increase its turnover by at least 30 per cent after the signature.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymar's escape by claiming that PSG would damage the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said the president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, of the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's last ownership of PSG.
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wender, whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations against a state that is financing a association.
"It is the consequence of ownership and has completely changed the entire football landscape in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fairplay because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big actor to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new shoe supplier
In the past years, Chocolate Frey has made table chocolate for the Swiss.
Now there is a possible end to this cooperation: the airline re-writes the order.
Swiss speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report of the newspaper "Northwest Switzerland" on Friday at the request of the news agency.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"We are very pleased with the current supplier Chocolate Frey," said the speaker.
Around 17 million small redboards packed to 14 grams per year distribute the flight attendants before landing to the passengers.
The Swiss did not want to make any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwestern Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros daughter achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But more important is all the advertising effect: for a shoe manufacturer it is a prestigious order.
How many applicants there are in the new tenders, the Swiss does not want to betray.
But only Swiss manufacturers come in question.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolate Frey wants to work on a renewal of the Spring 2018 Treaty.
For sda, the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for an opinion.
Schocoladen tables have been distributed by the Swiss on board their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with Migro's daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tables in cooperation with Hug.
The possibility to place the logo was introduced by Switzerland two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolate Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-distance flights, the customers of the First Class with snacks from the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class naked passenger shoes from Lindt and in the Economy Class shoes from Chocolate Frey.
On the short run, Swiss shares chocolate Frey's Shoggi, both in business and in economic class.
Light Athletes - Discus-Olympiazer Robert Harting reaches WM-finals
The three-time world champion fights for a medal on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, the Olympic winner of 2016, was defeated in the national WM decision and was only able to watch the discussion competition from the Tribune.
With the first attempt, the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, 65,13 metres away, qualified for the final match.
Nostalgie goes to "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" in the Nice
This repetition of the story is also nostalgic because of the glorious days of the 80s, for the 90s-year-old Grunde-era (as the predecessors David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves – that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact it is equally a parody and a body of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a Franchise, it feels like the time would be short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humor (it included an original story for a speaking dose of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By squeezing on the core of the Gag - actors of middle age play noble children who will grow up - they nevertheless made it impossible to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the cast principle, including a riff on the stalker movies of the 1990s such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Shakes the Wave").
At one point, an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991" stutters a character.
Many of the central stories are the same.
The beloved Coop (Mr. Shawalter), now Roman author, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his youth.
And there's another crazy-looking plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the Franchise.
It is particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, the Matt Dillon's under-reliance of "singles", whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old knocker.
It is the moments of random madness that could warm this Franchise like a kind of repeating "Seven Up!" series until he achieves what I accept as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the band how she will visit the movie premieres of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even the "GLOW" with its east-west Rinkamp iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-satisfied Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are synchronized in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, how Americans might do it with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truth of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who wears a reagan mask - that it often plays like a single one.
In six long episodes, the comedy is not fast enough or often enough.
"Comrade Detective", who was edited for a shorter time, could better deliver his Agitprop satires, as Gregor and Joseph are constantly visiting the American message, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men who sneez a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a feed for a situation.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own younger history and with theirs.
Fight against drug mafia in the country
The police have won a battle against the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest-Baar-Creis, in Rottweil, Constanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the State Prosecutor Konstanz announced on Friday.
At the time, 15 accused persons between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and already issued arrest warrants against them.
The officials also secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, guns and several hundred thousand euros.
At the same time, two persons were arrested in Italy.
Against the two suspicious Italians, there were German arrest warrants.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
A total of over 300 police officers were in use.
The members of the Mafia are accused of organised drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder, robbery and oppression.
Since the summer of 2016, the State Prosecutor has established a constant anti-organized drug trade in the South German area.
Between the state prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a regular exchange and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, four officers from Palermo were also accompanied by the major deployment on Wednesday morning.
The survey showed that Italian nationals were particularly closely related to the Italian Mafia.
An event on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired early in the morning in a guesthouse, was also allowed to go to the band account.
Mode of complaint large gaps in the foreign register
"Data of citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the foreign registry in Germany shows significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious shortcomings in asylum procedures.
The Commissioner for the Refugee Management of the Federal Government, Frank-Jürgen Way, noted a media report on major gaps in the foreign central register.
Failures to the data recorded there could lead to "partially serious decisions" in the case of asylum procedures and removals, cautionedly in an analysis that provides the "South German newspaper".
According to the data, ten million people with foreign nationality are recorded, including some 5,7 million non-EU countries.
The data are thus managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Since the data has not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts has not been good.
In individual cases, data were found from 1921, "of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register".
"Failure data can slow down returns", the report goes on to say.
In the statistics on persons with disabilities, EU citizens are also included, who should not go abroad at all.
However, such misappropriations led to "a distorted debate on the handling of exit duties", which is why it is said in the analysis.
In the meantime, the Federal Government has apparently begun to send refugee families with under 16-year-olds back to Italy when they have arrived from there.
This emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrück newspaper".
In the paper, then, BAMF conducts such procedures "for families with children - with the exception of infants and children - to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, it has been practically impossible, so the newspaper has referred to the difficult situation on the spot.
According to the Dublin Agreement, refugees of the EU state are responsible for their first achievement.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that country can send him back to the country of origin.
For reasons, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the capacity of admission for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly."
Italy has provided guarantees for the admission and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (EGMR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The spokesperson of the Left Party on the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticised this decision: "Familys with children are threatened by the lack of human rights conditions in the Italian asylum system and a danger of child welfare".
2nd Best Result
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichbach already provided the blood supply to other people.
At least twelve of the citizens who were awarded on Friday.
All ahead of Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, the community appreciates the repeated willingness to give blood at the meeting of the municipality.
"It is brilliant how our body is designed for it and we pay the donors respect that provide their blood to strangers, even useless," stressed Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained the circuit manager of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maizenbacher, for the cans are placed in their parts.
That's how three people could benefit from a blood transfusion.
At the same time, Maisenbach reported on the actions carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"In this year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRK-Creispreparation Manager.
Obviously, the change to the theater house led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago.
Already Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multi-purpose donors and were awarded 50 blood donations each.
Half so many books Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfomer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Veter gave up to 500 millilitres of her life so many times.
The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "tracked" when it maintains the interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure.
The Bank’s Monetary Committee (MPC) policymakers agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking an increase this month, as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and 1.6% for 2018 and warned that pressure on household income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to almost 3% in the fall.
But she pointed out that in the coming years, interest increases would be needed to raise the inflation fuelled by Brexit and said that credit costs might have to increase more than expected in the financial markets.
The members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mammut economic package, which was issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.
Minutes after the interest rate decision, the Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on household real income continues to weigh the consumption."
On the interest rates, she reiterated that "a certain penalty of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool inflation and a "something bigger" level than the markets expected.
The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "stepping" and "limited".
The bank's growth forecasts for this year and next year as corrected below are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 Euros.
The decision does not change after the latest disappointing growth rates have dampened the rising expectations of interest growth and GDP has risen to 0,3 % in the second quarter of the previous three months.
Growth will be expected in the third quarter at 0.3%, although it will be easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year.
The latest inflation report offers little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and low-cost increases, as the increase will get worse before it becomes better.
She added that in the next few years, monetary policy could not "stop" income collapse, but she added that the wages will be "clearly" recovered by the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak fund, which will compensate for some of the lower consumer expenditure.
The decision will come one year after the interest rate decrease to 0.25% in the last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the sinking of the fund.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until prices and the economy are fully reached.
Before the Bank’s last judgment on interest rates, the call for interest increased after a rise in inflation, as inflation increased the pressure on hard-duty households, with three political decision makers calling for an increase of 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank said that this was expected and will be reintroduced in the coming months.
The Bank said that the overrun in relation to its target of 2 % was "full" to attribute to the weak fund.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market should become more competitive once again, since the creditors are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who run the existing deals and close the new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."
NHS (National Health Service) is expected to send HIV drugs to 10,000 people
From September onwards, patients will be given access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the drug in NHS.
NHS England reported that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken before sex, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86 percent, is now being delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.
He declared himself willing to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal had confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court last year, according to which the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the fact that the local authorities should finance it.
On Thursday's announcement, NHS England-Chief Simon Stevens welcomed the "significant new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to be able to register people, and further clinics will follow in October before it is introduced in April 2018 throughout England.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV to infected people at risk.
PreEP before sex is taken means that just enough medication is available in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or two hours before sex.
Those involved in the treatment include male or bisexuals, transsexuals and persons with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and are registered with a home doctor may also sign up for a possible participation in their local sexual clinic.
The programme will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract for the supply of medicines this week after an international competitive purchase.
The study will assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence, how it is used, taken and implemented in a large way.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should complement and overcome the extensive and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the continued progress of more than three decades in dealing with one of mankind's greatest health challenges."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at people who are in need and at risk, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV will be released.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been obtained, we are in the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health of Shadows, said: "The start of the pre-EP process is welcome and overwhelming after months of delays and sudden implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will help to bring us closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society'.
Living the Big Life: Intermediate Shot and Clever Designer Tricks These little Earls Court apartment have turned into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court Apartment in 2014.
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof for the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet of large apartment has been completely taken over.
Originally a one-room property with a carved layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add a stairwell and an intermediate chair to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
That was my request," she says.
To this end, she commissioned Erfan Azadi's architectural and design studio Duck & Shed from Notting Hill to use 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The deck was not large enough to place two spaces together, so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate space where one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the default.
"The steel work is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked together, without having to book us.
It was not just to build a simple platform, but to lay the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama.
For the intermediate shot, a classic copper-lit window of retrovirus looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.
At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all bees and glasses of Joanne.
By observing a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Cumbersome kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it's a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went in there," Erfan explains by the reinforced, reinforced MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you move the door, it's very easy to move."
Thanks to the clever use of space and stauraum, Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate broker will enter and calculate based on the soil size."
Here they have managed to expand the surface and use high-quality materials that provide the space with its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," Erfan says.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical plugs in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that an apartment can transform from something standard to something completely amazing through good design and increased square meters.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave this.
Brothers fight for a 500 million US dollars real estate empire
Two brothers are located for four decades after their Italian family founded the Dynasty, in a conflict due to one of the largest real estate empires of Victorias worth over $500 million.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul. He brought him to the Supreme Court to explain how his property and business assets should be divided.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers owned 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail businesses.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centers in the city.
After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin, described by Paul as "main operator and dominant personality" in the family De Lutis, has about two thirds of the company's assets and about one third of Paul's assets.
A legal act says that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul holds a value of $176 million.
The division of property and money has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought was best for objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit.
The first hearing of the Court of First Instance was held on Friday following several cases.
The brothers are now also fighting to control the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claimed, excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but Paul proposes to manage some holdings incompetence.
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to put up with the dispute.
"My Italian heritage says that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports of companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and lawyers' offices held on both sides.
Ms De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy and delicate business in the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used security to buy the Collingwood property, where Colin opened the first Jeansload of the family.
Colin says he started there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons.
"Luig often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis company group, and Colin claims that Mark was paid $26 million while leaving the company.
Both Luke and Mark are, as Paul says, "have become offended over the conditions of their financial separation".
Colin stayed very back, although he was a former AFL board member and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire of the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin responded by texting to say "I really can't say much", because the case was before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to accuse me and draw our family names through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "always hopes for a solution."
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
"Our case will be resolved in the near future by the courts," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and have failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including the news media reports - in the hope of keeping the Chief on a more uniform course.
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"As John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with leading employees on his first working day, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that entered the President's hands.
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to warm Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship to television is back many decades - and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"When the candidate Trump was upset about an unfair report, it was productive to show him that he had received a fair report from the authorities that were to be convinced," said former election counselor Sam Nunberg in February towards Politico.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former election officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant price of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know about others - that Trump's Tweets would have contained more fuel without their intervention.
We'll probably never learn anything about the Tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his employees made it a few times to keep trouble from him, then their efforts were rewarded.
But no one has ever been able to prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a white house that consists of competing parties are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world.
Politico - which is very busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of the consultant to provide the president with questionable information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmaker:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he's going to find out where they come from.
That's exactly what happened in late February, when someone was reluctant to print a copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of Internet Provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Chief Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a heap of Lecks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of skis, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence, or that in the past he had made false predictions and rejected them.
Trump read the article and started asking about Walsh."
Goldmaker added that then Chief Reinance Priebus and Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper frame that receives the Trump".
How did it work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
He may prove to be more effective manager than a preebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted offenders receive a post from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the assistance of the population will be offered and expected.
The police in all of Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the sought-after offenders are of course not known, information from the population is expected and encouraged.
On Friday, Europol reported on the action following the "EU Most Wanted" event calendar from winter.
The experience has shown that many refugees are hiding at holiday destinations, which has been called Europol.
21 posters have been compiled for wanted offenders from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016 there has been the website www.eumostanted, more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed.
36 of the online visitors have been able to be arrested so far, at least eleven of them due to indications after publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a grave and return to the 'Millionary Row'
Some of the most prosperous households in the West Midlands are once again standing with some determined travelers at war feet, who have negotiated a tomb drawn from the community to claim a field in front of their masters' houses.
The travelers parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a well-being street of Solihull, which is called the "Millionary Series".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they had been expelled in May, but without being frightened by a grave excavated by the Council in order to prevent their contributions.
The tactical group found a gap in the defense systems and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained uninhibited to find a way.
Angry residents have harassed the Solihull Council, who said it was "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said, "They were taken there on Monday night after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passengers.
The Council must be forced to implement in fact by shame, since it was useless in dealing with the problem.
Travelers were there in May, were moved on and are back now.
The more they arrived last night, probably more today."
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect its parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the Council can't stop it."
A non-named resident said, "It's ridiculous, we've just seen the last round of these travelers just to be pushed by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you've even seen a horse in the parking area."
A spokesperson of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the country outside the Streetsbrook Road and work with the Solihull police. We take the necessary legal steps to move them as quickly as possible.
In order to support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many residents report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the Court must examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof Waldhotel Luise
From the former Birkenhof hotel, the Waldhotel Luise is located.
The house before the gates of Freudenstadt is now renovated and is to be reopened on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Birkenhof Hotel by the then Ambientesgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, about 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also incomes by the tax.
In the autumn of 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in the numbers of refugees who arrived in the county, the hotel building was offered to the Land Council as a collection meeting, which provided controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not incontrovertible at the time in the municipality.
But above all, the mayor of Freudenstadt, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel location and spoke of more serious interests at the house.
He should be right.
The group of Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer with seat in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a three-star Plus category house under the name of Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the city of pleasure.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
You are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Birkenhof Hotel, building protection containers have been standing for a long time before the entrance, and when you enter the house, you will see what extensive renovation work is being done.
The floors were dug out, roofs were partially demolished, old bathrooms were removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building.
There's still a lot to be done by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the black forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large comfortable showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are built.
Everything is to be "beautiful" later, as Thomas Schererer put it.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out there."
The swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are included in the equipment.
You don't want to be positioned on the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already on a elevated downtown level, sheerer stresses.
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to build wide, explains Schererer further.
Both individual holidayers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
Talking to OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause has already led, as Scherer.
The city's performances are similar to that of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
Mr Scherer does not want to determine exactly the amount of investment required.
Just under a million euros, he's counting.
The external installations are also brought to Vördermann, which is already clearly visible.
In an indoor courtyard there is a large terrace that will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Peace City is a good market".
Russia-Affaire: U.S. Special Mediator introduces Grand Jury
In the Russian affairs of US President Donald Trump, special mediator Robert Mueller will have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
The board took up the work in the past few weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal, calling on people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper considered the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his findings.
The CNN broadcaster reported that there were already first lectures of the board in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US Home Services have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time, aiming to have joined the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller investigates whether there was an agreement between Trump's election team and Moscow.
The focus of the investigations should be on several men who acted as advisor to the Republican's election.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more Trump's private and business environment under the Lupe.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Mediator Trump had personally stepped into the centre and examined the proposal whether the President might have impeded justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in possible cases of crime and decide whether charges should be brought.
Therefore, Grand Jurys is also known as prosecutors.
In general, they are activated when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.
The board may also be activated by the Public Prosecutor in order to propose persons for admission under oath.
According to the CNN channel, pre-trials have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Those involved in the meeting were invited to make a statement, as stated in the report.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his then election leader Paul Manafort were involved in the conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday night at the US television show that the deployment shows that Mueller does not allow himself to be intimidated in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary.
However, it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be activated at the end to decide on the prosecution.
However, the establishment of the committee was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new discoveries, the President used a speech on Thursday night in West Virginia to represent the Russian affairs as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The history of Russia is a total invention," Trump said.
The topic gives the Democrats an opportunity to "sympathize well because they have nothing else they can talk about".
His Special Adviser Ty Cobb stated in an opinion that he knew nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But these also usually work in secret, he stressed.
The White House endorses any measures that have accelerated the work of the Special Representative in a "fair" way.
The former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that he will not be identified against the president.
There is no reason to assume that there has been a change in this, it was further stated in the statement.
But Mueller was used only after Trump Comey was fired.
As a result of this draft, proposals against Trump were made, and he wanted to prevent justice.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to set up investigations against the then national security advisor Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure from the investigation.
After presenting US media, the White House collected material against the special mediator and his employees.
The solved speculations about whether Trump would want to release Mueller.
Unlike an independent special mediator of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair of late President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the demands of the President of the Ministry of Justice.
However, several senators of both parties want to avoid such a step.
On Thursday, two groups of Republican and democratic senators presented drafts of legislation that would no longer allow the Special Ombudsman to be released as easily as possible.
Antarctica: Giant Iceberg is driving in Antarctica
In the West Antarctica, a giant iceberg has emerged from the barely seven-fold size of Berlin from the Schelfeis.
This was shared by the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The heavy over one billion tons and 5800 square kilometers of colossus is now driving north and will probably take two or three years until it is melted.
It has a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres of one of the largest ice giants that researchers have recorded in the past three decades.
A danger to humans does not come from him.
To the extent that climate change has played a role in the end of the iceberg, it is unclear by research rankings.
However, there has been a series of unusual mergers of icebergs in the region for about 30 years, says the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a fact-finding background.
According to many researchers, this can be associated with global warming.
The now broken colossus was a part of the Larsen-C-Shelfei.
Shelveis swims on the sea and is eaten by large glaciers.
It therefore continues to grow into the sea and regularly collapses.
The Larsen-C-Shelfei is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
In the north of this shellfish, the balance of growth and abstinence was disrupted a few years ago.
A complete shellfish is falling down there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
Some people say that the Larsen-C-Shelfei is in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it is now.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and may break if a key is broken.
The melting of Schelfeis and Iceberg does not increase the sea level, as it swims on the water and forces as much water as it does after melting itself.
However, the loss of the shellfish leads the glaciers directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.
This could increase the sea level, however, only to a small extent, the British research project on observing Antarctica (Midas) writes.
The Larsen-C shellfish is the fourth largest shellfish of Antarctica, according to AWI data, with almost 50,000 square kilometres.
On the transition from mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, on the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
That's where it breaks down regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.
"That's the biggest withdrawal since the beginning of the recordings," he also confirmed.
Amongst the scientists, it was disputed whether the Larsen-C-Shelfei will grow again or go back long-term and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Even though these researchers have not caused the interruption of this giant iceberg to the climate change, many of the Antarctic peninsulas have collapsed in the past decades.
This long layer of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic peninsula's ice area has fallen by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic peninsula has warmed itself by about three degrees in the last 50 years and is one of the fastest-growing areas.
CDU wants home fare on staff
As it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy free-standing places, the CDU asks to leave the employers' association to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the Kreistag 41 has won new positions in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the board of directors in Metmann.
Now 17 trainees have their first day of work behind them.
The teaching sites around the circle are obviously very desirable.
Around 620 applications were to be made for the places to be granted this year.
However, the circle still lacks staff to handle the increased requirements and tasks.
At present, there are still 50 unoccupied places in the Mettmann district.
Among other things, doctors and engineers, as well as the general administration, are sought.
The CDU now wishes to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the Kreistag and address the lack of expertise in the administration.
The administration is intended to "make a concept for staffing and development" at the request of the parties.
The aim is not only to meet the short-term needs of professionals, but to counter the future-oriented shortage of applicants, that is to say.
The overall concept should focus on the inside and outside, show concrete measures for Quereins and include training offensives, call for CDUs, FDPs and UWGs.
That's what happens after a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know before.
Other cities hire good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The speech is from a regular "competition of public employers".
A large number of employees are excluded from the service by sickness or old age.
So the maximum time to act so that no more positions remain unoccupied.
But Klaus-Dieter Peoples, the leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint application with his party.
He soon took care of a fussdic surprise in the Kreistag, when he questioned the staff costs publicly and amazed the other parties.
Peoples want all the possibilities to be checked to allow an exit from the municipal employers' association.
"If we do not reach a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the board of directors should strive for a home tariff, as peoples say, in cooperation with the surrounding cities.
In this way, the CDU tries to pay the employees and officials better than it actually provides the tariff support for the public service.
The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money is only available if you switch to a higher level, which is oriented towards years of employment.
But the tasks of the circle have been growing in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up, in which employees would take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act.
Not recently because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hengele and Circuit Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy reinforces the tone of NGO-migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs that the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean should not continue to do so if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily newspaper La Stampa.
Minnitis Warning came one day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German aid organisation 'Youth Reveget' because their team had worked effectively with human dealers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on the detailed submissions made by Italian public prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, and the salvation of human life remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organisation said in an opinion on the social media.
"We can only assess all the charges currently raised after we have collected all the information and are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been watching the boat of 'Youth Retett', the young man since October.
It is assumed that its occupation takes on hose-boat Migrants, which are delivered directly to them by human dealers, and that the smugglers can leave so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast, according to the State Prosecutor's record, the content of which was published by Italian media.
The occupation is suspected of shifting the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue efforts in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats like the young people must have an Italian police officer on board, who is monitoring their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue have so far declared themselves ready to stick to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Active Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring "essential changes or obstacles" to their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize-winning organization is doctors without limits (MSF).
At the same time, Minniti said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy had declined significantly in the last few weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and to cooperate with local mayors had borne fruit.
"In the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the Minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe.
Increases and Trials
Nine Weilermer biker, the "Berliner Outposts" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in North Pfalz to enjoy four days of trials and sightseeing.
Three friendly guides were available.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Michaelskapelle above Didesheim.
There were views, partly on towers, from which you could look far across the forest and the prelated levels.
In the meantime, there were ever-long increases for the long trials.
On the second day, it went to Bad Dürkheim to the Salline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, the point of view was selected at the point of view, connected by "floating" trials and moderate increases.
In the last two days many heights were again mentioned.
caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and cottages brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers in the free-of-air restaurant smell the healing sun.
New city was also controlled.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 meters of height, the group had known the Pfälzer forest from its best side - sport and culturally.
Console instead of Rasen - Bundesliga is equipped for E-Sport
Are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future instead of fighting in the wind and weather over the stadium terraces?
The fact is: E-Sport is the longest to become a serious industry, become a lucid business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gagens.
This has also been recognised by the first federal leagues that are increasingly engaged in this area.
In early 2015, the VfL Wolfsburg, later followed the FC Schalke 04 and lastly the VfB Stuttgart, which established an E-Sport Department in mid-July and took two professionals to the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope that this will inspire a whole new young target group for the VfB," says the board of Jochen Röttgermann.
He's sure that "there's still a few associations up on this train."
In the coming weekend, the FIFA World Football Association in London organizes the first "Interactive Club World Cup", where the players of different clubs joined each other.
Besides Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven qualified themselves.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.
The former trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen currently advises an agency for virtual football players.
"The real football has to be intertwined with the 14 to 30-year-olds, that young people are still going to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The unions tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asians.
With prominent E-Sportlers under contract, you could be online more often in these markets than just sending the federal league to Asia once a year.
What's going on?
In e-sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or also the FIFA football simulation are run at competitive levels.
For the longest time, as in normal sports, there have been leagues in which the professions came up against each other.
And in the Asian games 2022, e-Sport is already part of the official program.
But is it a real sport at all?
For many, the idea is certainly necessary.
Ingo Froböse has also long dealt with the question.
For the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, e-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sports - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also needs cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a rapid response capacity.
Professional gamers should not only train their body at the console, but also take care of their diet.
"The fat player is a good player."
But Frobose also sees problems: "Doping becomes more and more a topic".
Controls are difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing.
Positively, the scientist has the high integrative effect of e-sport.
The players are international on the way, this is like a large global family, as there are no intercultural obstacles.
A study of company consulting Deloitte and the Federation of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) tells the E-Sport to rapid growth.
In 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and large tournaments.
In three years the turnover will be at 130 million.
Against the barely 2.4 billion Euros of the football league, this is not enough.
However, the e-sport is "not far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey", the Deloitte consultants write.
Many countries are still international.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-Basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate at the US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood-Schaupler Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport-Wettan supplier Unikrn.
In Europe too, there are a number of things that are going on.
In a Norwegian school, E-Sport was introduced as a teaching class, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, the football associations are currently obliged to set up an e-sport department.
"In the European comparison, Germany goes back," explains VfB CEO Röttgermann.
Only to fall into nostalgia, and to explain the old times, today is not enough.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time setting up the company in the modern market.
"We live in a digitized world," says Dutt.
"There's no point in the fact that it's just like it's always been at football."
Gift eggs ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
In the meantime, almost all the federal countries are affected by the scandal of poison-damaged eggs.
Aldi South and Aldi North have reacted and taken all eggs out of the sale in Germany.
Only eggs that do not contain fipronil should be taken into the regals.
Michelle Carter convicted of the texts that Conrad Roy forced to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and have been sentenced to five years.
Carter was sentenced in June because of the dangerous murder of Conrad Roy, who took his life on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said on Thursday at the hearing: "My family is unbelievable.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until he was summoned.
She was confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy had suffered a mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter stood there with tears in his eyes, with his hands folded and his eyes directed down when she was convicted.
"Your actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended her life to make her own life better.
She didn't take responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "wonderful situation which they utterly regret."
Justice Lawrence Moniz said, however, that he did not find that her "age or maturity or even her mental illness have a significant influence on her actions".
A public prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is "no day on which I do not trust the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I care about everything. I try to be there for his sisters in spite of all the pain we will have for eternity," it says.
Roy's sister, Camdin Roy, said that she'd be "followed" by the realization that she'd never participate in her brother's wedding or be a aunt for her children.
"No longer having this only person with whom I have been with since my birth every day is a pain that I will always be with for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to be a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another person to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Get up, jump from a building, climb yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he and his family were on vacation.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention by Roy's death and ordered that she benefit from any press of the case.
The case has divided the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British companion in Italy in 2007 before she was released two years ago.
Mrs Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michel Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new FC Bayern mini-lahm
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is not a coincidence.
The FC Bayern trusts the confed-Cup winner to a great season - extra motivation doesn't hurt there.
Something else was there on his seat in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even though the extra garment was very, very small.
But then, on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer were to be seen, he kept the bond he had assigned to him.
"The coach didn't announce it," said the confed-Cup winner afterwards, after his first use as Bayern captain.
Well, the unit could have run better than at 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of the coach, Kimmich, could also show.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was selected in the C-Elf that was made up of young players, debuters and just from the holiday profession as the game leader, but he.
Zuckerl is one of the best people to share with those who are very concerned about keeping with Laune.
So whoever has been chosen to enter the legacy of Lahm, a small extra motivation can only be used well.
Kimmich confirmed: "That's what you want as a player: take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old fought as a mini-lahm over the field.
Right back, that's his position now, the white tie on her arm did the rest of it.
And at all times Kimmich acted in this initial formation as the one who can best take care of the rudder.
He gave instructions, tried to link the unplayed body.
He had the full view, while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal in order to overcome his lack of fitness (he hardly hit); Renato Sanches in order to get out of hell to the services of the Asian trip (he only hit the condition); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle in order not to negatively occur in their first appearance in the Bavarian trikote.
But that worked out very well.
Süle lived next to Kimmich, Rudy before the rebellion, both acted sovereignly.
The famous Napoli storm was often difficult, and also tried to succeed a few times in the construction of the game.
His colleague Rudy said that the result "was not as we hoped".
But he also showed proper performance at the debüt.
Game shift, temp change: "For this style I was picked up too".
As this unusual Bayern world is still for the new entrances, one looked at the party as soon as possible.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich agreed to take a few silly statements behind his new associates.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What is going on here, I have already noticed.
At Bayer, you just have to win every game."
Still, he doesn't have to bring the new one any more.
Alabama Motivated ÖFB Women
David Alabama believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's most famous footballer has just reported on the game on Twitter and the ÖFB ladies wish everything good.
The Bavarian Legionary is almost a club-collegiate of ÖFB-Captain Schnaderbeck and fevert with our Lady.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and the Champions League winner should be a special motivation.
The famous Bavarian divers may also need our ladies.
Entrepreneurship satisfied with Rhineland-Pfalzian Minister: Economy praises Knowledge Tempo
It was often inconceivable that the relationship between the country and the regional economy, even though Eveline Lemke (Green) was the Minister of Economic Affairs of Rheinland-Pfalz.
This is shown after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V's demand for a change in economic policy - at the same time, the old minister.
Frank Natus, president of the Trier Company Association (VTU), says: "Wissing raises the desires of the economy that has blocked Lemke".
Natus sees the biggest turning point in the infrastructure policy: The closure of the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now in the country's priority list.
Even this year, the Ministry hopes for a plan-fixing procedure, which is due to be built by 2021.
A role in the plans of the country is also played by the Trier Western Movement, which is in the urgent need of the Federal Roadmap.
The aim is to operate the route in December 2020, says Minister of State Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees a guide in it to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier strives, as Wissing suggested, to use a Rheinland-Pfalz label for wine to increase the paragraph in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been absorbing for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company, the IHK praises.
In the new Master Bonus, the Trier Chamber sees an additional incentive for young learners, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A prize of 1000 euros is provided for the permanent master's exam and 2500 euros if graduates become independent within 10 years of master's training.
The country's home task list, however, remains for a long time.
The planned road construction is quick to create facts, while the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, chief businessman of the IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers who want to set up a mobility for the country operation, only 29 jobs have been occupied so far.
The IHK calls for more orders to external offices.
The CDU fractional visa Christian Baldauf refers to the calculations of the Court of Auditors that the country invests in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the acquisition of roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects another concept of the country, as he wants to address the lack of expertise in the region.
In addition, the former expansion of broadband in the country is pleasing.
In 2016, regional companies had assessed the network supply in an IHK survey only with footnote 3.4.
They complain about stacking internet connections and interruptions.
Former Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and remains in the Supervisory Board of the Pro Wind company.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private college in Karlsruhe - where she was already disembarking again after four months because of disagreements.
Audi is supposed to change 850,000 Diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a reaction
One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW president said that the company believed that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", and thus referred to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - to prohibit or restrict the use of vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the companies as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of Die Automobiles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with the rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered to be carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost of installing the exhaust gas emitted by Diesel vehicles for the automotive manufacturers also adds to what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of interrupting the powerful auto companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid the errors of cars that could regulate the use of so-called off-road devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the requirements when a car was tested, but would be back on normal driving conditions.
Several employees of Volkswagen were charged in the United States, and others were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to court in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to deal with emissions in Europe, and an inquiry focused on the United States was extended.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury car manufacturer contributes in proportion to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message has flow on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order to also accompany the Isar visitors, on Saturday morning, a river runs through Munich, which has a special message.
If it goes back to the Isar on Saturday, it will see a great river between the Flaucher and the Reichenbach Bridge.
And that's not the usual river, with Isar tourists.
Except for the farm trip, I'd like to explain.
On the river you can see a great info-transparency.
It shows a Müllberg.
The launch of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True Love is ..." the understanding for the Isar is to be enhanced as a protected wild river.
Since last summer, the river has flowed over the Isar and this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a careful and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillaless boneless noses and the laugh against the suffering
Mordillo was also one of the most widely published cartoon characters, the bone noses of his figures are his trademarks.
With 85, the Argentine artist is still working on a film.
His message: Laugh, "because there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, among other things, he went through as a sign of luck cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day of my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris he reached the end of the 60s of the breakthrough: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Every time, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, round Mordillo figures take place in drawings with the ship's tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, he is sitting on his own records today, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for large and small, T-shirts, pluss animals and watches, his grotesque figures continue to be widely distributed worldwide.
For six years he's been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures.
The main person in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - the most popular animal in its drawings - who has a thousand-end rider as an opponent.
For the first time, his figures are speaking in the 3D film, which is due to come to the cinema wall in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're gonna say, it's weird for me," says Mordillo.
The spinbook is not written by him.
That's why he's putting on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is worthless.
lavender from the Provence of Climate Change threatens
He has become a symbol of the Provence in South France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is decreasing due to the conditions of drought and the insects that transmit diseases, which prepares scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions to major headaches.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in the past years the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change, which brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has effects on the lifetime of Lavendel.
There is also a small cicada, a microbacteria that transfers zirgcicade, and in very dry weather there are many of them."
And there's a lot on the game.
Lavender oil attracts not only for holidayers, it is also very asked for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have less parts with essential oil."
The solutions taken into account include a better water distribution and the slowing down of contamination from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of tones and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates today its 1200-year-old existence.
This Saturday and Sunday is a medieval festival.
Creams, cheeses, merchants, vagabonds or a country servant camp are to be experienced during these days in the inner city.
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The workers of the Riodoc weekly will normally meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and unstoppable drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it was important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure: they are supposed to take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
You ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and feelings of breath.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's list of bills or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who put the chaos of Mexico at risk.
There is no peace of mind from violence, and while bodies are growing throughout the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, 589 are following attacks and threats under federal protection and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is her publisher and inspiration from Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His shortcomings will be deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" depends on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirty years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical panamat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after its death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
Like most of the thousands of murders that are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the murderers of journalists are only rarely brought to trial.
At Riodace, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are unreliable and although the ground is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little use, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"If we don't know why, we all doubt."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was arrested by two men. He was forced out of his car and shot at him 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a woman and two grown children.
Sounds tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But there is virtually nothing about Valdez as a silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's most bloody battlefields, as rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of depleted, two-storey walls for drug kings, who are bigger than many homes for the living.
For a minute forget that there is a state of "ruhe" if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.
Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the danger of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was guilty of not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February there was the release of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gang members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to Zeitungskisjös.
The second error was not to force Valdez to leave the country to his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had lived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars of stakes.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without facing the root cause problem," Bojorquez said.
In time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising took place.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-to-do investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that were not to be treated.
Eight years after the establishment of Riodace, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Price" for her report in Latin America.
In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for His Courage in the Persecution of Mexican Drug History, wherever she led.
He volunteered to admit that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug dealing in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in a interview with Rompevinto TV last October.
"You must take over the task you like as a journalist - either that or you play the fool.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many deaths ... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird that could run like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar next to the office, and sit there on the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for routine wasted?
His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how they could best do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you work with their wives, their children, their clean business, their secret start-up and land routes" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result, even in the best times, is a high degree of self-esteem and self-esteem.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The problem is, the publisher of Riodoce Andres Villareal said that "A sense of humor can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer applicable in Sinaloa - not as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which there is a toxic mix of lucid smuggle routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodace's staff met for security training, no phones were allowed. Days earlier it was known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 °C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were commissioned by the Government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle class district of Culiacan.
Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the policemen, who themselves referred to the Governor as unconfident.
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape where the drugs are de facto controlled.
For this week's edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exhibition on state spending that focused on the Governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was offered when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: the restaurant is a favorite place for drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter found out from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), who dominated almost all political levels throughout the century.
Recently, several PR governors were accused of high-level cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this location, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman was involved in a military incident.
Only a few months earlier, the readers had considered the column of Valdez as the best-informed source of withdrawal.
"We had already known what had happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the name "El Flaco" because of his slender body state.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
The office of Valdez was dedicated to the storage space for signs and stickers that protest the murder of journalists because the employees have become something they had never expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning because of another journalist at the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body was discovered and officers said based on DNA tests that it was his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by having written "SOS Press" on roads and buildings in organized protests.
On this day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after Valdez was murdered, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because they had told the truth.
She has since prayed that she will be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "indicted" by organized crime, involving government officials and an equal society.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism", he wrote that reporters were killed not only by drug gangs, but also at the command of politicians and security forces who were under a cover with organized crime.
The media watch group "Article 19" has assigned more than half of the attacks on police journalists and officials last year.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to shut your mouth," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murder has a terrible effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found together with a note signed by Zetas cartel: "I am here because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separate head.
Some branches have chosen to close, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern Chihuahua border country after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after her director was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with a headline on the title page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and seek dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it appears to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered three months after the flight from Veracruz, along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City.
For those who remain and continue to work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking scares him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
About midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was over, the editors of Riodoce sat on the citizens' stairs in front of the office and drank beer, when all their phones started to add up at once.
A series of shootings with band rivals and security forces near Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths.
The war continued to escalate as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.
Out of the board's corner, they published the news on the riodoce website about mobile.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens appeared nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police who kept the watch to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid at all, they wouldn't show it.
Under the violent portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for the whole Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his tracks.
"How can you just think about it?" said Bojorquez, "when on the same day that Javier was murdered, the practitioner asked me to send her to report to the street."
Dinosauri used tarnish to elude his enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, even a scary one.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nashorn of a Canadian mining worker were received so well that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
It was so well received that they could even find that his delicate skin was of red brown - and they said she had something of an "unrestful past".
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" referred to him as "the best-maintained dinosaurs ever found and one of the best dinosaurs in the world".
Fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosauri that lived in the middle of the period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its unbelievably well-recognised condition has been exacerbated by researchers who describe it as "very remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant fiber is the best fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was found in the Suncor Millenium Mine on 21 March 2011 near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, grub.
He found something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock in the square, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earthworms.
After all this hard work, the final result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it was asleep," said the lead author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.
"It will be included in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best received dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this plant fiber, although covered with a weapon and similar to a walking panzer, was probably threatened by meat-staining dinosaurs.
The heavily armed dinosaur used a red and white tanning to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as counter-estimation, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed for better mixing in its surroundings and alienating its enemies, experts say, which suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the family of the Nodosauri has made the first strike line in May and is now seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmetcheli, according to museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours in order to discover it carefully.
The amazing preservation of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of shells and weapons over his body.
They discovered the counter-estimation, a widespread method of defense in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although counter-estimation is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta is far higher than that of the animals living today.
It has been pointed out that the dinosaur was followed by sufficient pressure from meat-flavouring dinosaurs that the evolution favored the enlarging of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most modern animals that use counter-estimation - think of sharks, zebras or vertebrates - are much smaller and more vulnerable than bees, indicating that this nodosaurier was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"A strong predatory behavior on a massive, heavily pulsating dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal’s life, including its preserved intestine content, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, ran into a river and was driven out into the sea where he fell on his back to the bottom of the sea.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans are probably much further spread inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with preserved spicy skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early days of the crisis.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. If you're just a little confused with your eyes, you might almost think he's asleep."
The time of the cry was a time, as huge theropods, meat-flavoring dinosaurs standing on two legs that penetrated the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyronasaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, was hunted by some of his frightening ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster.
Scientists, whose latest findings in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was mummified after death in the sea and in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was found in the Suncor Millenium Mine on March 21, 2011 near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-maintained dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the snout to the hip.
On average, the creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1.300 kg).
It included two 20-inch long peaks that were cut from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the pruned plant fiber was swung through western Canada until an overflowing river flow flowed into the open sea.
But the underwater crew of the dinosaur kept his weapon in exquisite detail.
The hidden remains of this special copy are so well received that the Høstertes still cover helpful panzer plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a gain in the lotto.
The more I see it, the more confusing it gets.
Stained remains of the skin still cover the sideboards that carry the animal’s skull.
His right foot lies on his side, his five fingers are pointed up.
I can count the shells on his sole'.
In the heat: mass carabolage on A8: Many injured
Severe accident on Thursday evening at A8: Almost 30 vehicles are wrapped in a mass carbage.
There are many injured, km long staus - and gaffers.
On the Stuttgart-München motorway (A8) about 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass carnival.
According to the police, at 5:00 p.m., almost 30 vehicles, including trucks, were forced in between the Adelhausen and Odelhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) connecting the station.
The exact number of victims was not reported at first.
It's about easy to get serious injuries, said a police spokesman.
A large offer of rescue vehicles was at the crash site.
The A8 was completely blocked towards Munich.
In the direction of the road, Munich was about ten kilometres long.
As reported by an AZ reporter, there were also massive obstacles on the cross-roads - due to numerous deliveries.
The firearm noted the characteristics of the vehicle anchors that now have sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 6:45 p.m., a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car carrier and a passenger.
A lifesaver was on his way to the crash site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tested "Comfort Check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has already experienced: nothing but sitting in the train and sleeping.
Or you're deep in your work and you just have a great idea.
And then: puff.
Comes the creator and wakes up an unscrupulous person or rips the passenger in the middle of the workflow.
Vehicle card control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
The German Bahn is currently testing the wireless roadmap control.
You simply confirm by phone that you take your place and thus value the ticket.
Currently a test operation is running on two routes.
"If we offer the offer, we extend it.
Then it is expected to be available on many other television routes in Germany in the beginning of the year," said a train speaker.
"Comfort check-in" calls the train the driver rating without the creator.
However, in order to use them, some conditions must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - what most passengers are doing anyway.
You must also have it over the app of the train that has bought the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking.
And last time you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: You get up in the train, you call your ticket under "My Tickets".
Then an electronic evaluation button appears for the test customers.
The train drivers get a message on their mobile devices that the passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train crew arrives at the Y place, they know that there is a passenger with an already rated online ticket.
So you can sleep, work, keep sweating.
The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which is to be used by the passengers.
"Anyone who wants to travel by train crew without a check-in check-in simply checks himself in the DB Navigator.
This enables passengers to make their travel time more personal," says Michael Peterson, marketing board of DB TV.
Second, "And our employees have more time than today to address individual customer needs".
Anyone who is often on the road knows that in addition to delays and missed trains, driving card checks are one of the biggest problems.
Because often you have yourself, in any case, but one of the fellow passengers does not have all the documents you need to review online tickets.
Either the credit card or the staff card is missing or another document you need to present.
The consequences are endless discussions between train drivers and passengers, which leads to a bad mood in the department or big room and delays in controlling your own ticket and the creator is finally taking time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And this also only on the links ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Eats.
Other train numbers on the same track are not yet fully activated.
How did an activist come to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shot down to its core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, St. Louis was born on the bed of an airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolld through Facebook on her phone.
She came across a post from someone from the High School.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," he said.
She was confused because no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with @TheePharoh has been repeatedly quoted on her timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was killing Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed alive by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo..
He posted a picture of Brown's living body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She dropped her phone to return to Tweets later in the evening about people on the Canfield drive.
There were photos of the police band and people screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father who carried a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a belldog.
In another video, she said, another cop took his gun and shouted, "I'm going to kill you... animals all."
"It's not common," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"That's not the kind of murder we've been used to and we can call it typical."
At that moment, I felt a gunshot.
I was angry and crying."
She booked a return trip and went home the next day.
After the landing at 23 o'clock, she took her six-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas since the 11th century.
It is a story of survival and of protest, of love and of loss, of strength and of resistance from the perspective of the people who have lived in the Community and filled the streets to ask for answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown, went to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had many times before this morning "about the black experience and the black condition".
"Do you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her," Ferrell said later.
"What has happened today is a highlight of what has happened in the past.
She must know it and see it and be picked up there.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and black constitution, and what we need to do to be free to free ourselves.
Even if I have the chance to give her an experience in which she does not personally experience any eclectic racism, she is no different from the next black woman child.
I have the feeling that I would prove her a bad service to keep her away from it."
The first station, when it arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florisance Road, a place near the police station that became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-accused officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter are connected to a local businessman who made lunch.
They prepare bags and help to pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly a new kind of activism began to take place for Ferrell.
"My activism has changed completely since 9 August," she said and noted that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association, she was focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all here."
A week later Ferrell met with Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-regisseurs during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farnar just wanted to "document" what happened.
A question came to mind, "Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"
This schepsis was touched by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently stated in an interview: "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson had not focused their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already collaborated with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death extracts.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other natives followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary isn't someone who talks to us or speaks to us, we're talking," said Davis.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are represented, because that's how I'll be shown."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that gathers," Folayan said she turned out to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" show surprising personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she loves herself and marries her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understand that in this work and in the humanization of black people, there must be a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black-swedish women in the broader Black-Lives mother movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who, after the murder of the Black Teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as bad.
"Black, heavy women in leadership positions have worn the whole movement," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, poor women must bear the main burden of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women".
However, it states that "this is not an affirmative type of action", at which Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who raised this energy," she said.
"It is no coincidence, although she was at the front, because in life on these crosses as a black, slender woman is so much at play.
You can sense their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have disappeared for a long time, but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on bail for 21⁄2 years due to the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration.
She describes the social political atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home: "A Chaos".
However, she complains to a song and feels obliged to this memory since she went to Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains."
From "Tream" to "Sizeway": TV-Readers discuss Bit Gallery
The Bit Gallery moves people, although it hasn't been built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping center in the south of the pedestrian zone has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold leaves the subject barely one.
Also on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" the topic will be discussed.
While those who say to the Bit Gallery: "It would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "It would be a real class" (Nicole Schausten), it comes from the other side: "Do not need a man" (Siggi Betz) or quite simply: "Sizeway!" (Lars Scholz).
While supporters are building on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, including the other businesses, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
In addition: The gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the farm market hall is located, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the start of the construction work, this will be the end.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and to the Beda square with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Room: "We have been buying in the farm market hall for almost a week for many years.
Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women always very much.
We discovered the metzrei for us, too.
We would like to see that during and especially after the building of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.
There's this in other cities too.
In particular, the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "If direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery, the rent is high.
The new project, however, may not be very low."
Eva Kilic: "Why Shopping in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugs or supermarkets: I find it excessive.
There's enough of that in our city.
You can see how many cargo stores are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that we keep at least the market hall.
However, the product offered there is fresh, most of it is offered directly by the producer and is also priced.
As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are rented only by larger companies, because the rentals there are often not portable for a retailer.
Damage, special business is almost gone, and what remains of it will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit in to Bitburg.
Above all, where should the farm market go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the Bit Gallery comes sometime.
Or does the mind bit-galerie already manage to distribute all the business from Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "It just won't work.
And no one needs a shopping center that's empty.
In my view, it would have been better to promote a right agricultural market instead of this gallery.
But for a farm market hall, thanks to the crazy many - as I find - useless construction projects in Bitburg no more room.
If the farm is cut off, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A suitable similarity: Artist creates Portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost unmistakable - hanging on cables from the deck.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupferen and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former Secret Service Analyst was sentenced to 35 years in prison after she made secret diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, opened on 2 August, is called A Coming Resemblance (a suitable similarity).
It is the product of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transfrau and deviant dissident, whose condemnation of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has a sharp, although some intellectual comment not only about the formation of DNA data - the many ways that they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity through the algorithmic analysis of DNA that was extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly since her puberty about identification as a woman, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of spy law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photo - a corny, black-white selfie, in which the manning apparently sits on a driver seat and wears a platinum-blown wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarettes and rubber, by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of what these people might look like.
That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained in a press release of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at the time and couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artists and their imprisoned museums have become uneven letter friends who have exchanged letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Supressed Images", illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which predicted a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would turn and would be able to see the exhibition personally.
In fact, just a few days after the book was published, Obama’s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a kind of happy meeting.
There is also now at the opening of the exhibition some depth and strengths, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops in order to find new, two-faced ways to further burn out the sharp divisions that he should actually repair.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason".
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning asked for an end to the "automatic division, whose basis has been sex, race, sexuality and culture" (the "i" in her family name).
On the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand foot of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people will hopefully take from it is that our Genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a private room, is a page from the comic novel mentioned above.
She shows Manning how she appears with a free speech phone in her hand from the United States disciplinary casseroles like King-Kong.
"If they cold your speech, then they won," it says.
"So never hold your mouth."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, welcoming from Philadelphia.
"I'm still getting a ghetto when I talk about it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was previewed in the comic book - but if she should do it, then she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own geometric simulations, which combine like hordes of Protestants.
This was also targeted, as in the exhibition, to the size (5 " 2, Mannings Statur), where their genetic haplo groups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a multitude of people," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind her liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwest and an employee of the University of Oxford sought for murder
A nationwide manhunt is in turn for a professor at the Northwest University and an employee of the University of Oxford who is being sought as suspects after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago had suffered fatal injuries.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the files of the Cook County Court show.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several strokes.
A Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Office said that the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the site, and detectives were investigating the evidence as a murder, while the police were actively looking for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at the Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now allowed and was excluded from entering the campus of the Northwest University.
"This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is Senior Treasure Assistant at Oxford University.
A speaker at the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the United Kingdom and are ready to help the US intelligence authorities in any earthly way."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Office, Anthony Guglielmi, said he asked the suspects to put the authorities to a stand.
"The police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them are strengthening," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building, who had just received a huge tip, saying that something happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza management team published a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and are investigating a variety of motives, including a possible home incident."
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for restoring the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been entitled to plan and test in cooperation with UK Anti-Doping.
The WADA flight plan was updated in this respect," Mutko explained on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re-establishing RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, he contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything was announced, everything is implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," he added.
One of the criteria set out in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the results reported of the investigation approved by the WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to state-funded dopings in Russian sport.
Regarding the issue, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation, as our anti-doping system has made an error.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we won't admit anything that doesn't exist."
Mutko's words were in agreement with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
In the discussion with the Russian sales agency RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov added problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the Doping scandal by WADA from conducting doping checks in Russia.
However, you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKPD).
After a visit to the main quarter of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" to be used again.
Aldi sells no eggs first
This was shared by the company groups.
This is a purely precautionary measure, which could still not be eliminated by any health damage, as stated in the communication.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have been shown to be negative for fipronil-containing anti-inflammatory agents.

The startups that will help your company not to become the next bridge
Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck of your employee at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - misleading.
And even if you promise anonymity, some workers don't trust the process.
"There was simply no consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee's commitment, it enables companies to carry out surveys, contact special groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaints hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to deal with the C-Suite leadership forces and to contact the Board of Directors directly.
"They now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit to track their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software-analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees' commitment.
She said she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years she won with Glint.
In addition to the snapshot surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a hot card from the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low consent results - so that you can nest, why.
Companies come to see that you must stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you do not become the next Uber that was developed in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of injuries that punished those who spoke.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The Global Governance, Regulation and Compliance Branch could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, following the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Converter, the company helps prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity early this year in the middle of the Uber-False in miscredit.
Converter has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Converter lets companies send custom "Puls-" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the hot cards of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline, which allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the chief employer is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has recorded the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
When a company is found which treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Converter for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple opportunity to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he or she was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Council, who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees.
Now, since the company is using Converter, problems previously hidden from executives sitting in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly - such as discrimination, harassment or inadvertent practices.
"I can get closer to this comprehensive, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who runs the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Business started to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the "Social media came to their right", that companies recognized that you couldn't prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Converter offer your software as a service, and they charge companies with repeated fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and a chance to find the consent of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Converter received $10 million in the financing of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more of their jobs than ever before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high fees and interesting projects are only investments.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that they belong to their voices, and that the work you do is rewarding, then they feel more committed to making this company succeed," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employment Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If the third-party analytical tools promise to increase the involvement and use of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on the employee's commitment to the experts of the workplace culture are important.
But the data is useless if the administrator of a company does not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it can expect that change is on the way.
And if the change is not fast enough, or not at all, this can trigger disappointments and discourage employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen the companies that have left too much to collect data.
"Because if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves, "Have you really heard me?
Are you taking care of that?
And if you don't worry about why should I?"
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, as it were.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems through the speed of decision-making and quality of communication.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights into employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this leads to a better bonding of employees in a sector known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, then you lose companies.
The NSAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It goes up to 23 hours as a lot of UCLA football players on one side of the team's new training fields on campus.
Some have pulled out their tricotober parts and show the back full wet from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes represent a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after three hours of practice before returning to the Waterman Football Center at 6:30 p.m. the next morning.
"This is a real tree mill for the boys next three days," said Bruins-trainer Jim Mora just before Monday to Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the load of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three trainings of the UCLA should start at 19:15 to correct the already packed schedules of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mora's six games in Westwood.
They will be held during August 18 exercises. 20 before the start of the formal preparations for their rise against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supported the regulation of the NSAA even if it added another point to the multi-occupied route of the players.
"We put this huge burden on them three or four days, and it is very challenging," said Mora.
"And they just pushed it through, they stick up, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great."
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is over, which, in view of the clear lines of its fields of a adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the elevated class, which has already been challenged with foot-belts, which would not be an easy task.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel this weekend, but Mora assumed that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," said Mora.
"That's a real problem, and it's not too much to think that people rent a room there and then settle down there to record a practice.
If you have the video tape of a practice, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
That's why I'm not so worried.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify facts in the fight against false news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third party reviewers and then show their results under the original post, the world's largest online social network on Thursday. It's one of his efforts to fight so-called Fake news.
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to identify possible error messages and send them to reviewers who may display the results of the fact-finding from the original article.
Facebook has been criticised as one of the main distribution points for so-called Fake news, many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 presidential elections.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with the French voters being overwhelmed by false stories in front of the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to be punished after social media networks if they fail to succeed in eliminating hate-filled posts as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook told German in a separate statement that a test of the new facts would be launched in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to the knowledge which stories of third parties review, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "connected article" and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages.
Making a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scottney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaar Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to look at someone's handwriting who's been dead for 300 years," he says.
"What for a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' covers the time from the Middle Ages to the Ages of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scotland. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotionally.
"I have only reacted to the dome print on the side of a letter written by a doppelganger in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobiner," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if he himself were in it.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone who was so beaten with old papers that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have a little overrated my welcome"), all this seems to be nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, visiting the archive and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the grave.
He walked through the site and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape keepers, gardeners and sometimes also the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night he drank "Whiskey and started writing".
Scottney's intimate history is relatively unknown, since the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees began to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundred years of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it on the floor".
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps that represent who possessed something: "You might think that country conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a Birke to have fought for the two families.
Boys, let everything go his way!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to explore English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm in 1381.
"There is a recording of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The farm revolt began in this area and I thought a rebellion was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit father, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English reform.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the Smuggler Arthur Darrell, from the 18th century, staged his own worship by filling a sarg with stones (a discovery made only years later when his sarg was dug).
The Darrells are the Rhodes' favorite family of Scottney: "The gentlemen seemed to be pretty good, always making debts and spending money for things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I present them to me as a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to hire her."
After the end of his use in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has taken a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elêmanmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been called back from nature.
But Scottney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to finish the damn life again."
Campaign started: Over 300 years old Marien chapel in Rhöndorf covered
With the cover of the 301-year-old Marien chapel in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roof brand (round view of Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August, there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too nice for us.
Or?", the action makers have been asking about the posters on the Rhöndor Kapelle since yesterday.
"We don't really think that (of course!)," they wrote on their yesterday-free website.
"But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that some are better than it seems.
In fact, we are firmly convinced that as Bad Honnefer citizens, we are very well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
In the action, it is about more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it goes on.
"It is worth formulating a standing promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable characteristic of self-esteem."
Finally, they are in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef is able to cost its new roof brand and the campaign a medium-sized five-digit amount.
Military Reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's Fear of the Army
Each year in early August, the Military Council (YAS) advises on pensions and transfers in the office.
So is this week.
At first glance a normal procedure.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as before, but at the office of the Prime Minister.
The consultations were held under the chairmanship of the Government of the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister of Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs.
So the civilians in the YAS were in the majority.
The government is pulling the triggers in the military.
Chief General Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the Air Force and the Navy have been suspended.
Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of the alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gulen, who sees Erdogan as the wireteller of the attempt.
Against 486 people who should have been directly involved in the pouting attempt, it has been negotiated in Ankara since this week.
Already on the day after the pout, Erdogan had referred to the attempt to convert as a "gift" because he gave him the opportunity to "clean the fighting forces completely".
But does Erdogan really have the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unhappiness in the Military Headquarters".
In the General Staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamicization" of the army, which, among other things, manifest itself in lifting the head ban on soldiers, wrote the newspaper.
In any case, the big-up of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan had another 7395 civil servants fired by decree, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had buried the military.
The generals were before the real lords of the country.
Triimal put her role as the guardian of the world state order under appeal.
Following his election in 2002, Erdogan withdrew the military power step-by-step, not least in calling for the reform of the European Union.
Former officers say Erdogan drives forward an Islamization of the forces of war.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe" a non-named officer, who sought for fear of persecution abroad, warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If this is the case, such a development could not cause the nato to be cold.
Nevertheless, there are doubts in the alliance after the cleansing of the Turkish army.
The management structures and operational capabilities are "weak", say nato diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It plans to reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for a short-term work permit and restrictions for families-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in both Chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and this will be done by changing the way the United States changes its way of spending the citizens from other countries Green Cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy," Trump, quoted by the American media, said.
Ministry wants to repair tracks for racing shuttles
It has always been argued over the future of the race shuttle in the past months - now it should go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, the route is to be built on the route of the tourist.
In order to ensure the long-term future of the race shuttle, construction work is scheduled to start this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and repairing the Ilmenau race path, the country recognizes this connection especially important for tourism," said Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl in Erfurt on Friday.
The cost of maintaining the route amounted to approximately EUR 2.5 million.
Of this amount, the country accounts for 75 per cent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future, is now finally agreed, explained by Sühl.
The Ministry and the Südtüringen Railway as an operator have already agreed on the technical details.
"This is how the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," Sühl said.
The proposed contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of 11 years.
In order to be ordered on a regular basis, the Rennsteig-Shuttle will be ordered on December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a railway connection, especially popular with tourists, between the railway stations Ilmenau and Rennsteig.
In the past few months, a pilot operation has tested whether the route is used by enough people to order it regularly again in the future.
The route is also highly breathable in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just as you thought it couldn't get even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots comes.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are a big deal at the moment.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, an emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we have to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the chest and the type of fingernail.
"People are making fun of them, but companies deliver every amount of them, and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report.
Modern funguses have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone hat that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his convictions and then choose everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the chestware to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it will be even more disturbing as many robots have the "personalities" that would allow a Stepford woman to appear progressive.
Modern funguses have developed into robots with a silicone hood.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appropriate, such as fearlessness.
And then there are the Roxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which convey the impression of cowardice and "Wild Wendy" with an "advantage" personality.
"Roxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible", the website of True Companion warms up.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods over the course of the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, be fixed on conversation, or she can be "in a mood!"
There are many disturbing aspects of this rise in sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underlying female characteristics, the allegations of rape, when you take a step towards Frigid (i.e. here: opposing) Farrah, disturb one of the most.
On his website, True Companion Roxxxy compares with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have no Roxyxy?" it says on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing refineries point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with undermining as an optional addition.
Of course, most men do not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notices their growing popularity, they remain temporarily on the edge of consumer culture.
But what is safe from the border zones can be very educational in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not unusual or damaging until the free market allows them to do so.
However, there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots occur at a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has spoken of having sexually assaulted women.
The most frightening aspect of the TV series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Magd Report') are not the graphic images, the disfigured bodies and the enchanted eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap.
The aim behind these sex robots is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (but also with pornostar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel humanly that they follow the movement of a real body.
But when it comes to their "personalities", the robots are not real women.
They cannot separate from their companion or simply leave.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that suggests independence or anything that might interfere with the imagination of total undermining.
In other words, they are worthy slaves.
Or to express it in the speech of 2017: Service Girls
Trump's great performance?
He makes between Romney an integral part of the healthy human mind
It has become a binge of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. electorate have also split families into small information.
Around Christmas and Easter there were newspapers in the United States with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-elected relatives.
We all insist on letting our filter bubbles take place.
Less notice is the power of Trumps to bring together families.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-handed poet who lives in Chicago and has been busy with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, is suddenly and very peculiarly on the same side.
About the table is certainly a good thing, but I think in another context that this also brings significant risks to myself.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the creative effect of his presidency has the power to move us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we are referring to the cruel possibility that we will not be shaken by his measurements one day.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario, in which the trumpet Republicans of the right wing are "normalised", which suddenly appear to be a sense of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.
I find myself today from an active nostalgia for Middle Romney's hilarious version of the crazy - the dog on the auto roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax statement looked like) - both of them actually appear to be as very mild crimes compared to Trump.
When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be spiritually healthy only to qualify as an indispensable improvement.
When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to Karussell in the Central Park, the largest Karussells in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a coffee.
The horses are enormously large, the Fiberglas designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are clumsy and the animals turn to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely window and the climbing music conveys this in a remarkable way.
So many clichés of a city are disappointed: the views of high buildings will be old, the skylines will be trusted to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not be justified in the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not far from the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not actually a Swiss Cottage - the topic-Pub Ye Old Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big circuit in North London.
The Central Park Carousel, however, is still a rare magical experience, as two two-year-olds, one 11-year-old and two-year-olds can go on it in the 40's and all have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full number of points, but luckily nobody asked.
On the other hand, this week I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to compare the rating with a 15% drink money - this to buy something about the shop.
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where it is not necessary.
The poor woman in the storehouse was apologizing, while I was tired of having her credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pains transferred from prison to the hospital
Pistorius has for the second time left the prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to a hospital because of the treatment of cuts at his wrists, which he was hospitalized to the prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was sentenced for murder after an appeal from the state attorney against a first death warrant.
He killed stone camp in the early morning of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a night raid that was hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appeal, from which they say they are too careful.
The National Criminal Prosecution Authority said it would be challenged by the Supreme Court of South Africa and the opposition could be heard this year.
Pistorius is at risk that his punishment will be increased to 15 years if the state prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
As a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumber schools, the four kläslers from foot and epfenhofen were released into the holidays and further schools.
Three of the graduates will go to the gym in the future, four to the real school.
On Tuesday, Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental Burgerhaus in Epfenhofen.
The 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regina Meder, chose a young eagle who grows up in a caveyard, but then will be released to freedom.
To this end, the coined char led a musical with the title "Der Adler in Hühnnerhof".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and let it explode from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken kitchen, a little eagle came out.
But the hope of making a cave out of him fell, the Adler spread out his wings on a high mountain.
Then the classes showed three and four in Yvonne Frank's one study a chicken dance.
The hens danced with the young gockels who wore cylinders to the bets.
The Adler stood for integration, the school principal Angelika Sitte said.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (cooks) but belongs to them.
But he'll never be like a cave.
His purpose was to be free.
She wanted every fourth grader to feel accepted in his new school.
It was followed by a thank you to the colleagues, the former school principal Michael Müller, who is always running out at the classrooms, and the parents' representatives.
The kitchen time was over, teacher Sophia Schumacher explained.
After two years of teaching, they gave up their students only very little, because it was a really great time.
Finally, they have been able to rely on the fourth class.
At the end, all the students made a song of summer time and holiday time.
The children were delighted.
Eight first-class students have already been registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by TV, shared with them.
On the morning of August 1st, a group of illegal-sacrifice people, including the two Bulgarians, were arrested by the police in Sithonia.
On the same day, they were released while a study was being conducted.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have stepped up the control of the free camp and impose considerable fines on anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles: What the People Need to Know Now
How exactly is the software update taking place?
Should diesel professionals participate in the action?
The main questions and answers in the overview.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars in the Euro 5 emission classes and in part Euro 6.
Euro-4-diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe provides estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the processed software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates before apply only to the vehicles that have the foam software," says Anja Smetanin.
Its refurbishment has been arranged by the KBA.
How and from when are customers informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a prompt implementation in the coming months, but have not yet called an exact date.
Daimler has informed you to write to each person concerned.
If an inspection is still due, it will be carried out within their framework.
How long should the overall alterations be allowed to go?
"It's hard to say," Smetanin says.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as on political pressure.
"Because we have seen that the car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the topic of the environment so far."
How long the update should take.
The refurbishment itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
Time-consuming people can get a date.
What are the drivers doing who don't drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW group?
The ACE advises to wait.
It is likely that foreign producers would be attracted, as Smetanin said.
Are you threatening a massive price drop in Euro-4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But just in the regions where traffic bans are threatening.
In the rural area, there is no value loss for older diesels.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first prize award under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the prize winners does not want to come - from protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the desired awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year also includes singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95).
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host and participate with his wife Melania in the award.
For this reason, Lear, who became known with progressive TV series, announced that he would refuse to participate in the Gala.
The "New York Times" said: "This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to take away the funds - and that is what weighs me".
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify their views.
The Kennedy Centre, named after the former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Among the previous prize winners are Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city viable
Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbameister, goes to Rente next year.
The job has already been written out - suitable applicants are rare.
For 31 years, Wacker has been a city builder.
And the work still makes him great fun, as he communicates in the press conversation.
He reports on many different but also demanding tasks that await his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet met the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer as soon as possible.
So - given the regular deadlines - there should be enough time for a registration.
Since Haslach acts as a Lower Building Law Authority for the administrative community, the applicant must present the relevant conclusions.
Because this function wants to keep the city anyway.
If they could no longer complete it, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But closer to the city and to the city itself is important, says Wacker, who reports from a good business climate as well as good mood between authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years at the office, some important projects have been gathered, looking back at the Wacker with pride.
"We make the city of life," he is confident about the building and his employees.
But in the future, there are also many different projects on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Lowerhof parking lot have been attacked.
The kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadiumization is still a topic.
The latter alone will hit the book with about 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right", Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun."
In design, there is a large play space for a city tree master.
With Haslach's own construction and gardening, many can be responded quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the greenery is often mentioned by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is under the protection of mind, it is important to have "an eye for what is fit", when new buildings are approved, the distinguished city tree master emphasizes.
Withouthin, the city treekeeper has a high responsibility.
He's a builder, "it's all over my table at the end."
He can count on long-term employees in his care and coordination: Markus Neumeier (High Building) has been at Manfred Schöner (deep building) for ten years.
Also, that his successor stays long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really identifies himself with the place and wants to stay."
Because continuity is not only important for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
Those who want to occupy Roland Wacker should be able to present a completed study as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor with a dedicated architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and planning law.
The City Building Office shall be assisted by high and underground construction, construction planning, basic employment matters, management of urban properties, the City Administrative Court with Bauhof and urban gardening, as well as the Lower Building Court, including mental protection.
cast bikes on lines: southern track closed
According to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had cast the blue bicycle from the railway crossing in the area of the Leobener Street (B116) on the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the lifting suit had to be stopped.
The investigators have gone out of two men and have been searching for them for hours of the night.
Near the tavern, a pink roller and a bicycle rider were observed by witnesses.
"This goes far beyond a loophole," said ÖBB spokesperson Christoph Posch to the APA.
They or the perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and would also have put themselves in danger of traffic.
In addition to the damage to the loop and the installation, as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement transport, there could also be pönals of the railway customers.
Overall, it was a "great" sum, the speaker said.
The damage was remedied on Friday afternoon, the train could be operated on the southern track without any obstacles.
Nearly ten passenger trains were missed on Friday morning, two of which covered the distance.
Goods didn't fall out, but they were late.
According to ÖBB spokesperson Christoph Posch, some 200 meters of overruns had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, milk products and chocolates could help to relieve IBD (inflammatory tanning)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestion system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory dark conditions.
The incurable state, which affects about 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes stomach cramps and swellings, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While the affected are usually found to breast-feed meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that the immune cells are patrolling the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not enter the body.
Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammation.
In experiments it was found that a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance is present in mice that carry a certain bacteria in their intestines.
And the bacteria need tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance image of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have developed a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbial, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan had the mouse in their food, the more they had these immune cells."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal environment, even if the same system works in humans.
The postdoctoral Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had been separated, had not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the stomach microbes of the mouse - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the stomach-damine treaty.
The stems of the mouse were DNA sequenced and six bacterial species were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing at the mouse.
Mouse was removed in a sterile environment, so they lacked a intestinal microbial and they did not develop this type of immune cell, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, researchers let L. reuteri grow in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - to countless immune cells isolated from the mouse.
The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as indol-3 lactic acid.
If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mouse, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptohan values were half down, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our stomach-dams.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammation.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially high tryptop values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United with Nemanja Matic has committed a "Genie"
At Manchester United, with Nemanja Matic signed a "genie", Jose Maurinho believed after the middle-field player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The 40 million pounds of Chelsea's signature began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last preseason game, before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder roll, when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were premarried by fans.
However, Matic had been excluded from the Asia-Preparation Tournament of the Blues and only made 45 minutes, which Mourinho added that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium, when Maurinho formed his start XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Maurinho wanted three further new obligations, but he insisted that the club had already performed a "fantastic work" to meet three of its four priority new obligations.
"Get three out of four, I thank the association for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've done a lot of work."
Draws "malt" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots fled from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a dreamliner across the United States, which are several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the form of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was a test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such an announcement.
Thus the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New depth strike for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
As the wind turns: As Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD chief, social-democratic Prime Ministers were always looking at elections with a certain concern for Berlin.
Only no fire from the party center, only no counterwind from the alliance - so said the most important desire of the voters.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the employees of the Willy-Brandt-House have been observing the events in the SPD-run capital cities with growing design.
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach.
It was deep.
And one after the other.
The Bundes-CDU sees after the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against the coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot rule faithfully," said Secretary General Peter Tauber of the German editing network (RND).
The surprising factional austerity of a Green Member has shaken the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the country day election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
Green Federal Business Manager Michael Kellner has called on the dreary Lower Saxony Green Ambassadors to return their mandate.
Transgression to the CDU means a clear counterfeiting of the electorate's will.
Every West must immediately return her mandate," said the Federal Business Manager and Election Commander of the Greens to the Editorial Network of Germany (RND).
"It must not be all true," says an SPD-Whalkfämfänder, when on Friday morning the new hiobs message reaches the party centre.
Stephan Weil, the president of the SPD Minister of Lower Saxony, is standing there after the resignation of the Green Members of every West to the CDU without their own majority of governments.
It is the provisional height of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD country associations.
And no one knows what comes next.
The miseries began with the unexpected clear defeat at the Saarland elections in March.
A blue eye, no more, calmed down the comrades of his time.
After the elections in Schleswig-Holstein and Nordrhein-Westfalen, everything will be different.
And then it got worse - and, of course, it's getting worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the Taumeln, the Düsseldorf-Pleite was shot down by the party.
Hard to recall, after the weeks, the guests recollected.
Then, when they had just created new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next strike.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD country chief, lost his Nimbus that weekend because he sat in Elbphil harmony while burning his city.
And because he then made so much of everything wrong in the crisis communication, what can be done wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now we're still Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW gas affair and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Dutch Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time.
Misses surveyed were added.
However, or perhaps just why, because of the past few weeks, he has been trying to put more and more accents in the fed.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin were also not hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz.
They gave it to him because they promised to stabilise the party.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
Because of this, there is no blame on the domestic branch of the Low Saxony Greens.
And Schulz isn't.
Sometimes the comrades try to keep their own rows closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and here, above all, at the dreary parliamentary West.
"It is inconvenient and democracies, as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests over the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, Head of the Party Links in the SPD-Bundstag Group, the Editorial Network of Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has not been elected as a direct candidate for her person, but has been elected to Parliament through the country list of the Dutch Greens, so the Dutch Member continues.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, Head of the SPD Federation, complained of a "undemocratic Manover".
"The voter's will was clear four years ago: the people have made Stephan Weil the Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate in the federal election, to the RND.
"Now the personal career memory of a future CDU deputy distorts the outcome of the election," Oppermann continued.
He called for clarification of the background.
I want to know whether there has been more or if there has been any further commitments made by the CDU Lower Saxonys.
Funding for local skiers III
Anyone who wants to repair the house in the years to come can soon receive support from the country.
About this, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG City Development on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a look back to the previous event.
Since 1991, there have been areas of healing in Refingen.
At that time, in the recovery zone I from 1991 to 2004, the country of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.
In the recovery zone II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 per cent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "success project" - it is finally important to promote internal development, and not only to open new construction areas.
On 4 April, Karlsruhe received information from the Government Bureau that there will be a recovery area III.
The amount of the aid amounted to EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 came from the country, the rest of the municipality received.
How does a healing area come about?
You will continue to explore where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role in improving whether there is any interest in the planned area.
If so, the boundaries could be re-moved.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday.
Keller presented the contents of the federal program "Social City", in which the adjustments would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalization of urban cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on an object, i.e. per plot.
The area of repair would then be determined as a statute.
The period of authorisation for the funding shall run from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, until September this year, the stocktaking would only be carried out in the framework of which the participants in the recovery area received a questionnaire to be completed.
In November or December it will be possible to take the legislative decision so that the amendments can be started in the coming year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the above-mentioned investigations.
It is to evaluate the urban maladies and decide when they will be repaired and to what extent.
For each piece of land, a repair notice will also be entered in the basic book.
Pietzschmann himself will come back to receive and make a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the involvement of the participants.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent by mail to the public in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land books", where it concerns, among other things, the building state and the repair intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "house and apartment book", data can be made about the size, distribution and inhabitants of a living room.
The blue "operational arc" is only to be completed when operating in the building business spaces.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel points out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, refurbishment measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funding works according to the "Windound Principle" - who comes first, paints first.
You can't afford to "reserve" money later.
Finally, photos of the project "Storkern II" were shown to make the participants a "tasteful" repair.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come home and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand motion.
Steven Northham, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and pointing fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, a consulting Anaesthesiist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hunts, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standard.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northham also wants to change the locks to houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip, all for a price of £ 300 per lock.
The married father of one has now built up both at home and with his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is on the tax.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands
The decision of the White House to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights the last month's American production costs taxpayers, according to the military's data leaving the TIME magazine, up to $24,000.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was the heartpiece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter made in Connecticut was exhibited next to a yacht made of Maine, a Wisconsin fire-fighting car and a Mississippi forklift.
The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, almost 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, following the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the night of the event to his supervisor, the deputy commander of the Navy for flight.
The report showed that the helicopter arrived at South Lawn on July 17th at 7:00 a.m. for the event at 3:00 p.m., and remained until the races between 18:00 and 21:00 p.m. were cleared this evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the limited hours of service, a second team would be required for the return.
The original flight crew took place during the event at the helicopter, while the unit's safety staff remained on the ground during the time at the aircraft.
The time records made available did not indicate whether a second flight crew was necessary.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 asked whether the event could affect the destination.
"A question we asked was whether it was an infringement of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander said.
"It sounds like you're locked up," the deputy commander replied.
The event "Made in America" was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But also official events have political overtones.
At the event, the President issued an appeal for the reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to enforce government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as the Marine One or Air Force One, for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But asking for their use only for a photo-OP is unusual.
Trump conducted a survey in February when the President's aircraft ran its first campaign in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of reports that complain about the use of the President's aircraft by its predecessors.
"The White House is thrilled by the show "Made in America" - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials," said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often conduct training flights in the area around Washington and in South Lawn to stop the US presidents in the White House with precise centimeters.
When Trump was on the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercises in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event included the training needs of the flight crew for the month," said one official.
Helicopter units also fly 11 hours on this day for "non-presidency support missions".
The White House said that the taxpayers took the burden on none of the other requirements presented at the event.
One speaker from Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in exposing the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not hold budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
According to hourly rates of the US Ministry of Defence for the 2017 financial year, however, the DoD compensation rate for the VH-3D is USD 24,380 per hour.
Unit records record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs of operating the helicopter are far below this rate.
"To determine the costs for taxpayers based on estimates for the refund rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual resources."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the refund rates for DoD do not include staff costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract termination.
At that time, the former press speaker of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present this week things that are produced in America," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the Federal Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, even if not thousands of people depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is of course appropriate to highlight that."
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he walked over the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the seat of a fire truck.
In the White House Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW News before Knife Task
The top rider of the Second Tennis League will enter SV in the third of the table Searchdorfer.
The TC Blue-Weiss Neuss will enter Kiel from 11 a.m. on the third of the table of SCHSdorfer SV.
Despite the fact that five parties still have a smooth balance sheet, the top rider of the Second Tennis-Bundesliga has been given the sense of reality.
Teammate Marius Zay has respect for the opponent anyway.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
I think the team is very good at the back position."
For class and stability at the search village SV, the imports from the high north are mainly concerned.
"Those Danes and Finns can even refer to the exercises in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in double," says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Soören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all of Denmark).
"It's always going to be hard for us.
There you also need a good lot of luck."
The Neusser team for the trip in the high north is practical.
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime Janvier.
If the currently active French francose does not belong to the Bundesliga party at the Challenger Tournament in the Italian Biella, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) who plays at the tournament in the Czech Liberec comes to its first use in this season.
The unsurpassed Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was yesterday with the white Russian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel at the ball.
He should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team.
If it is not enough for 18-year-old Hungary, which was still one of the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coach staff fills out the box about Marius Zay.
How America can harm the OMV
Donald Trump did not really work happily when he placed his signature on the law on strengthening sanctions against Russia in the middle of the night.
"In his haste to pass the law," the Congress packed a few "constitutional rules", he ate.
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and Brussels itself was ashamed of the US presidency.
At the same time, the proposal is intended to punish European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines in the EU.
It is worrying that investors of the domestic OMV have since been co-financed with other European companies in the construction of the Russian Baltic Command Nord Stream 2.
The drugs are violent.
However, it was too early for an assessment of the consequences, so the official status of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself had to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are at his disposal.
"The press" looked at who the group could refuse and who could really hurt him.
Narcos Staff 3 trailers: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel is pushed into the center of Netflix’s hotline.
Despite the second staff of Narcos, revealed by Pablo Escobar's Killer, the series of Netflix is not far past.
The three and four staffs were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first to receive their first trailer and show the latest evil weights of the show.
With the third staff, the DEA has focused its attention on the world's richest organization of drug trafficking: the Cali cartel.
Guided by four powerful patents, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" with only more state attacks and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is the Mexican association, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly published trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type of American and Colombian law enforcement authorities invited to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third staff of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Roll back: The city introduces 46 kitchen aids
The city reorganises the Kita lunch table itself.
With firm contact partners for the children and an assignment to the team.
In the city's children's places, the clock is turned back.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the city's children's day-care facilities (Kitas) in its own right.
For Sonja Pomeranz, deputy leader in the field of youth assistance, this is a good message: "We are all very happy".
Cooked is still outside the house: A Catererer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked cold.
The city operates 46 children's places in the Krefeld area, in 44 children get a warm meal for lunch.
In the last year, 2,800 children sat at the tables, and the need grew constantly.
"In the meantime, not only eat children who are cared for for for 45 hours in the Kita for lunch," explains Pomeranz.
"The offer also applies in 35 hours care if children stay up to 14 hours."
46 part-time workers have a kitchen service from September 1st: they warm the spirits, supplement them with salad, raw food and fruit, serving the meal individually, dispensing the food, cleaning, washing and cleaning the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a kite," says Pomeranz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - decides over the hour span.
"The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the Kita team," says Pomeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more involved and it is for the guidance of simple, pedagogical concepts to be implemented."
For this is also the case: healthy food and cooking.
"The children are supposed to help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful.
For the kids, too.
"They have a known power in the Kita, a person who is familiar with them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleansing of the Kita rooms - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out in the future by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen services - has, in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen service, also the charm that it displayed in the cost comparison between self-registration and abroad for the city as the most economical one, is from the press office.
And that, although 46 part-times are re-established.
"But these hours don't fall so hard on about 750 people in education," says Sonja Pomeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of the society, including women, play a role, the UN mission leader in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the official leader of the United Nations mission, said that hundreds of women will be candidates for the elections in the provinces. Three women will be candidates for the role of Vice President and more than 30 per cent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate unrestricted and are involved in all parts of the election process.
Afghan elections for the Provincial Council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have issued threats to an election process that coincides with the transition from international fighting to a consultative role.
This year, elections will be held for the first time in peace from a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will still strengthen Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission reports that 1.2 million women from 3,6 million registered voters are registered.

Men try 13-year-old girl out
Two young men aged 19 and 23 were supposed to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to information from the police, the men spoke to the 13-year-olds who stayed with friends on the Kolpingstraße at 2.55 p.m. because they wanted to call the girl's phone.
The 13-year-old refused, however, and went on with her friends.
Then one of the killers tried to grab the girl's phone and necklace, but what was wrong.
The duo was running away without a bite.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigations are ongoing.
GMB concerns about investments in the McVitie Factory in Glasgow
A trade union would like to make sure that managers of the McVitie Biscuit manufacturer have the long-term obligation to produce in their work in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had sworn about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the work, which produces in addition to other products Hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse.
McVities Owner Pladis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would "be the first to experience" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the head of the company, GMB Scotland McVitie called on "to consider that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be pre-empted".
GMB Senior Organiser Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of the Tollcross is of utmost concern to our members.
Generations of families have worked here, and the labour forces are very focused on the local community and the Greater Glasgow, an important pillar for human employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and well-being, and in the background of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline of production, the eastern end of Glasgow is pressing a flourishing production presence at McVitie."
A spokesperson of Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly as we appreciate the continued commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that we, like all companies active in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the heritage of Tollcross as a production site. If our operations change at the site, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this."
Did the PSG Barcelona warn Neymar three years ago?
The side of La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verrati
Paris Saint-Germain will not fail in his persecution of Neymar after giving a bid of £ 189 million to trigger his release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years before the world record crash?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer, as the League 1 Club is ready to break the world record to more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds last season.
After the end, Neymar will be the most expensive player in the world and the world's most paid professional athletes. PSG offers salary of more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan presidency is that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned by the PSG president three years ago before this view?
As Manchester City 2014 showed interest in the signing of Blaise Matudii, Nasser Al-Khelafi had a strict warning for every association that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll stand up to them, we'll contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to let one of our players sign with them, this will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line, with the Spanish association expressing interest this summer at the PSG-Middlefield player Marco Verratti.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.
Rolls wrapped and damaged
On the night of Friday on Saturday, an unknown actor deliberately turned a roll set aside in the King's Field Road before the number 30 being in place and thus set aside for the wear of the vehicle Saxe damage of more than 200 euros.
The Schramberg police, phone 07422/27 01-0, asks for instructions.
In an accident at B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, the police are looking for witnesses.
Because he had a car on his trail, the driver of a VW Touran had to leave and touch the guideboard.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW at 7.55 p.m. on the B 215 from Stolzenau was heading towards Leese.
In the area of the locality of Stolzenau, a pkw came against him on his trail, so he had to deviate to the right.
The Touran-Fahrer touched the lead board.
Sachshaden was born at Pkw.
The driver of the opposite Pkw, a Mercedes Benz, had taken over a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.
According to the accident injury, it may be good that the Mercedes driver did not even notice the accident.
The police now ask witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the vehicle responsible to contact the police station in Stolzenau under Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report released Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on abuses released Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to provide for discussions.
Christian Wesnder, spokesperson of the reform movement "We are the Church", explained after publication to the German Press Agency, he expects an apology from the former Bishop of Regensburg and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as from Domkapelmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Pope Benedict XVI.
It would be very useful for the view of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret over their own omissions or their mistaken assessment of the proceedings at that time.
On the other hand, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" criticised that the report on violence in the domestic courts will be measured with "secondary measure".
With regard to the violations in Regensburg, no one doubts that they are "disgusting and shameful acts" which must be punished and prevented in the future; but be abstinently the "grad of media manipulation", says author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Committee of Bioethics.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it for normal," Scaraffia writes.
Prince Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with the Bavarian radio: "You like to go to church and that is a french found".
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, "fighting was a very normal pedagogical means" to "endow with frightened children, as I was one".
She found it unfair to apply today's standards to decades ago, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on abuse cases, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Completely unjust, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memory band "My Brother of the Pope" (translated in 12 languages).
"I have to take Georg Ratzinger for protection," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is stated in the 440-page report submitted by Lawyer Ulrich Weber, commissioned by Bistum Regensburg with the clarification?
A total of 547 Regensburg domspatzens were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of assaults, 67 domspatzens.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, said: "In summary, therefore, it can be observed that in many cases forms of physical and mental violence have been applied by Domkapelmeer R..
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students was also more severe.
However, unlike many other defendants, many victims valued the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases even connect positive memories with him despite violence."
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger explains his opinion.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Events of violence against security officers at the Regensburg Domspatzen" gives an contradictory picture of Domkapelmeister Georg Ratzinger.
For one thing, many students have raised their "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who of the latter became handy when a domspatt gave no musical top performance.
How do you rate this final report as his biograph?
Michael Hesemann: If you are making the effort and reading the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is there at all.
He has just been dedicated to him eight pages, and he will clearly be freed from any suspicion of coercion or coercion in the horrific cases of sexual abuse.
The violence rates at the preschool also occurred outside its scope.
At any rate, it can be denied that it is too late to learn or that the first statements are not taken seriously enough.
The domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was felt by practically all the respondents as - so literally - "resolved", "heaven" and "better world".
Likewise, the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, is a very excellent witness, describes him as "warm hearty", "loved", "right", "competent" and "understanding", as extremely kind teachers who regularly provided the boys with cakes, cakes and candy and were "always surrounded by grapes of children".
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has already led to riots.
Not only did he kneel with his chairs and throw the key on the ground, but he also spread ears and pulled too many boys to the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regrets and apologized for it.
However, in his honour, it must be said that such education methods were widely disseminated at the time of question, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as well as teachers.
Do you still know such breeding methods?
Of course, I think of every one of us who was born before 1968.
I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.
Compared to what is actually involved in this report, namely sexual abuse and violence at preschool, they are free of charge.
There you will be wondering if it is more than his acquaintance and his role as Benedict XVI's brother that many media were just hitting him.
In the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him are still working hard.
But the truth is: the report releases Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In the media, much has been reported in connection with the report on abuse in the Regensburg Domspatzen.
Will Georg Ratzinger also put any development or awareness into the final report regarding sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Not at all.
None of the 67 victims of sexual abuse claimed to have entrusted themselves to the Domcapell Master.
Not even the parents were dedicated.
"I never believed to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one concerned representative to the others, "It was all very painful for me."
The real problem with the disclosure of sexual abuse was and is that most of the victims are in shame.
If they do not even trust their parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader who would certainly have been a colleague of the perpetrators.
How, then, do the Domspatzen-Schüler Ratzinger's role in the case of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: An interrogator formulated it as follows: "Excerptly sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had timely knowledge and could have stopped the individual offender.
I think it is ... even for really absurd to assume that it is calculated to him ... Bubbling more aggressive or clearer or even more open than their parents, internal leaders, teachers of trust, etc.
That you're talking to him about sex... - inevitable."
Thus, the report goes on to the very clear result: "The fact that he was entrusted with his students and/or their environment in the past could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation".
So, as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free from any conscience.
Thus he cannot be denied, prevented, or exposed.
There is therefore no reason to link his good name with these reprehensible crimes, as it has happened in some cases.
In the media there was a lot of "Gewaltexzesen" reading at the Regensburg domspatzen.
The former Mayor Georg Ratzinger is proposed in the report "Towards".
Does he have to live with this suggestion?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in the report everything was mixed up and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
But that's exactly what this report is all about.
There is a clear separation: between preschool and the gymnasium of the domspatz, between sexual abuse and violence, and, once again, we say otherwise.
In addition, the report has been dealing with events since 1945, including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the head of the Domspatzen.
All the terrible prune pedagogy, the cases in which slaves of sadistic teachers were regularly harassed and abused and were subjected to sexual harassment, all at the preschool in the underground and Pillenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions had to prevail.
But with them, Domkapelmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with, because he only got the boys face-to-face when they were already on the domspatzengymnasium.
On that was how most of the witnesses stressed the topic "Preschool" tabu.
You were just happy to be gone and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What else was on the domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but there was no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even connect positive memories with him despite violence".
That's how the pretense remains to have been shot.
However, despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.
The first time in 1970/71, when he began to establish himself and from the proceedings at a school where he had not acted and was responsible, (so the Witnesses) did not want to hear anything, and then only again in 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger lock his ears in front of the state?
Michael Hesemann: No, for since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
He points out that "the punishment will continue to be practised in preschool".
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when prune punishments were banned in Bavaria for the longest time.
Before that, they arrived in a legal gray zone, as each of us might know.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected might have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he'd always shot away.
That's just not true.
It was only in 1980 that the prison sentence was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed yes, it is unfair to apply the present educational standards at that time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "Falstrick of Anachronism", that is, the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.
The Prince is right.
But of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which has been apparent at all times, nor to what was interrupted in preschool by resistance and violence on innocent children, which is far beyond what was then common.
That's all very scary, and I'm glad it's finally done.
But at the same time, I have to protect Georg Ratzinger because all of this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, to draw ears and ears, were widely distributed in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then prohibited, he also refrained from it.
What picture of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger present in the talks with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Did the subject of prügelppepe also come to the language?
Michael Hesemann: Now, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, since the Domspats played only one side role.
Nevertheless, I do not hesitate that he led a strict regiment there.
But this also has to be said once: Without this perfectionism, without requiring unnecessary discipline, it would not have been possible for him to form an institution of world rank from the rather nationally known Regensburg Domspatzens to form the true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With Keksen and Bonbons alone, you can make no great singer and stand before every success, no matter which area, but always discipline, passion and self-transgression.
As for a man, did you ever experience Georg Ratzinger in talking to her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I have really come to know Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again as a wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply believing and good-hearted person, from whom one cannot imagine that he could do something even a single flight.
I get regularly with how many former dominoes still today, 23 years after his emeritus, keep in regular contact with him, visit him, read him to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.
Those who do not forgive him to this day that he was once hard on them are thus clearly in the minority.
Most of the dominoes are thanks to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but he was also a loving respectable person, to whom they still look today and to whom they deserve to be honored.
And, once again, make it quite clear: all that is proposed to him is the methods of education that were then on the agenda.
We can be glad that we have overcome this time for a long time.
But it is most unfair to make a man, only because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, to make a medial sin.
There is the evil intent behind it only too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published releases it.
Now the stand would be offered to a 93-year-old man who has earned great merits and without the outside Bavarian and perhaps not even Germany would know the Regensburg domspatz finally in peace.
