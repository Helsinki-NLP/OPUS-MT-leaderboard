The citizens' right movement issued a travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Benefit of Coloring People (NAACP) has issued a warning to colouring people travelling to Missouri on the basis of the discriminatory principles of the state and racist attacks.
‘The NAACP travel recommendation for Missouri, with effect from 28 August 2017, calls on African-American passengers, visitors and residents of Missouri to pay greater attention to the state in the event of a series of racially motivated incidents occurring throughout the country’, states the Association’s statement.
NAACP stated that this step had been taken on the basis of the current legislation of the State of Missouri, which facilitates the defence of racistly motivated acts before the court, as well as the conduct of criminal authorities which are disproportionately aimed at minorities.
‘There is a violation of civil rights.
People are stopped by police just because of their skin color, are attacked or killed," NASA City Star President for Missouri Rod Chapel told Kansas.
"We have so far gathered the greatest number of complaints."
This is the first warning of its kind, which the organization has issued to the United States.
Among the incidents quoted by the organization were racially motivated statements directed towards students of black spots at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a man of black spots from Tennessee.
Sanders died under controversial circumstances at the beginning of this year, after he was taken by the state when he was travelling across the country, and the police put him in jail without charge of committing a crime.
The road recommendation also points to the recent declaration by the highest state representative of Missouri, which indicates that black-haired drivers have a 75% higher chance of stopping the police.
"The purpose of the travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and colleagues before what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared - they should be able to drive money with them to make any bail or warn their relatives that they are going to travel by state."
According to the current numbers of the FBI programme for reporting hate acts, hundreds of cases of hate were reported in Missouri in 2015, reaching sixteenth place among all states.
At the same time, travel alerts respond to the new Missouri Act, which makes it easier to appeal to the company for discrimination in the provision of accommodation or employment.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Association (ACLU) issued a travel recommendation for Texas and Arizona after the States approved an immigration law allowing state actors to detain people on the basis of a violation of this law, which is to improve racial profiling, according to ACLU.
The travel recommendations are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for foreign countries, but recently the legal groups have deviated from these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the United States.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family doesn't even have peace after 12 years!
Sally Anne Bowman's model was murdered.
A girl from Croydon was murdered in 2005 by Chief Cooker Mark Dixem directly at the restaurant where she worked, and she suffered stab wounds.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana, then he killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby cafe and watched a careful criminal investigation of the crime scene.
Dixie, former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years for murder and rape of Sally's model.
The judge only admitted a youth attack, and the lawyer claimed that his client had found a girl dead on the street.
After three years, he was certified by the police.
Dixie said Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson had a bad night.
The killer said, "He was really angry, and after his attack, the girl started screaming."
"She even attracted the attention of the taximen," he said.
The girl was supposed to defend herself according to his statement, which she could, of course.
Lewis was gonna stab her on the street.
Dixie's version was proved a lie and accused him.
After Dixie confessed, he talked about his tenacity and taste for the girl.
When he was having sex with her, he felt satisfied and had to burn his marijuana.
Before the incident with Sally was with his ex-girlfriend, they drank alcohol and took cocaine, he said to the police himself, Dexie.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so she attacked her back and put her hand through her mouth," added the Mirror Linda.
And after twelve years, the family faces further attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
In the last half of the year, he was injured four times.
There are so cruel people on the loose who dig these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," said the Mirror mother of Linda's fallen girl information about the disappearance of the ashtray.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
The design vibrators are worth tens of thousands.
"Cheese are neither priestly nor conservative," says Martin Ráž, who operates the Prague Intimity store.
You'll find design and luxury erotic aids in it.
Including those from the Czech designer Anna Mareshes.
It started unstoppable, about twelve years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went out for a cycling trip to Moravia.
One of them didn't just bring a bike, but also a box filled with immorally looking vibrators.
"A variety of herbs and dolphins and all of them were green and yellow and simply different," she tells me about lunch.
His friend also decided to cooperate with the German manufacturer of Fun Factory's design erotic aid, which Martina was interested in, so he offered to help with marketing.
When the companion left to pursue other professions, he replaced him.
Today it operates in the Prague Benedict Street store Intimity, where it sells erotic aid in the way luxury cables or shoes are usually offered.
And why not?
It's also about design objects.
Wait, wait, this is what you're talking about at lunch, you know?
Come on, don't be such a puritan!
It's just a Berlin Fun Factory store, which proposed a renowned designer Karim Rashid, served for the Intimity store as an inspiration.
They opened it in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic trade than everyone is used to.
No hidden exhibits, all made in beautiful, decent style, products exposed rather as in perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdeňk Šebelko started thinking about how to take up the Prague business where he should be and what his name should be.
The name of Intimity fell in love with both of them.
"It's all about intimacy, and it's even, let's say, gentle," he says.
It followed the purchase of internet domains and the search for suitable space, which went parallel to various interior visualizations.
Finally, she won the variant, which spread the store into the garden of luxury and the bedroom that leads the bed.
Dagmar Štěpán from FormaFatal has prepared it for us.
We found the space in 2013.
First of all, he didn't seem perfect because he's not on the main street, but that's why he's sitting in the name of Intimity.
He's intimate.
He's in the street next to the main one, so no one's looking at customers," says Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be the first.
We wanted to make a deal that would be different, with brandy nice goods, in an environment where women who are mostly our customers feel good.
And not to be ashamed that they even entered such a trade.
When I walked into the Intimity store about an hour and a half ago, the street wanted nothing.
Besides, I didn't even feel like I'd go to the erotic aid store.
I was immediately surprised at the door by the clean interior elegance I know from my fashion store.
Even though there is only a female service in the shop, so that women don't hesitate to ask for help, it doesn't mean that a man's leg won't come back here.
Most of the gentlemen here are going to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men mostly can't estimate the right size and prefer the more," he smiles at the frequent error.
These are the precepts, the congenital clichés that women need some great help, and that's not true.
So a man in good faith may choose an extraordinarily large vibrator.
Likewise, men prefer mostly black clothes, which the woman just pulls to pink rather.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product called Satisfyer.
From the expression in my face, it must be clear that I don't know what's going on, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's such a touchless clitoris stimulator.
Pere needs a teenager in me to be amazed at the serious tone with which I'm given an interpretation.
It's like it doesn't look good.
And that's not really a joke.
It's at a good price and has a perfect user reference.
We didn't think he'd be so welcome.
It's some kind of last revolutionary news.
The first revolution caused a vibrator in the shape of a sea horse.
He took care that women were becoming more interested in the design of such products.
The other one was the We-Vibe pair vibrator.
He completely missed the taboo that some men can endure, and that he sees competition in erotic aid.
"Various variants are made," he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
It's a favorite category.
In a loving connection, a woman may have in her hand a controller and determine the intensity of the vibration.
On the contrary, a certain failure is the category of attachment vibrators.
At least it's ours.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose aids and buy classic vibrators, although then they should only use it externally.
However, in Western Europe, especially among younger customers, it is very popular.
What about the men?
It's hard to say whether a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
It's probably a little different.
The question is what to offer men," Martin thinks.
"And we have help for them, but to a limited extent." Mostly the masturbator is sold, in this case from the Tenga manufacturer.
It doesn't look like the anatomy of vaginas, but it's like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
It focuses heavily on functionality and experience in use.
In Japan, it's completely different.
It's driving a fuss in me.
I thought the Japanese would suffer a lot of erotic help, I'd say.
"It's the Internet reality," I'm told.
The whole thing's completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more associated with the use of women.
In Japan they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary they are taboo for women."Only for interest - what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the Intimity shop, sells worldwide, still forms about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
The Czechs and the Czechs aren't even smart.
On the contrary, we're a whole lot of people.
Definitely different from the country, such as the Catholic Poland or Italy.
The typical customer of trade is moving between 35 and 50 years and "already has some experience with sexual life, but with some help.
It will come for something nicer, more quality than a partner's life, or for herself." To get back, Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeňk Šebelko are making sure that each product is fully functional.
We also do not want to be allowed to specialise in the type of bondage and latex, because we do not have room for this, but this is not the case here.
Such things could reflect the ones we're trying to target.
Which are people who always had to go to the sex shop because they were afraid they'd have to look at something like that.
Many of the products displayed on the shelf are really popular.
It is also indicated by the selection of the designated marks.
Some of them even won design awards, including Red Dot Design Award.
The first award was the said sea horse "and it left a change in the whole sector.
It started to run out of cheap materials and instead to work with healthly inconvenient, it started producing other designs, different colors...
It is nice to see some of them standing behind the design of the Czech Republic, though popular designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say that it was quite nice to be surprised how many people here are buying the design things Whoop.de.doo from Anna Marešova, even though they're relatively expensive.
They're customers who're walking straight for Venus balls from Anna Maressov.
She really took a huge part of the work by representing exactly what we are trying to present in the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic aids are able to do differently, nice, with a story.
Anna's story started as a schoolwork.
Now it's a finished product that's also made with us.
I wanted to have a production process under control and I also wanted to know which materials and how whoop.de.doo products are produced.
Because it's not about big production, but a small series, it's definitely more expensive than a large series.
Maybe I'm going a little off the line, but I think it's important to keep our development in the Czech Republic.
It could be that in a few years we will not be able to produce anything," Anna later described the situation, which agrees with Martin that our company is more open than ever.
It does not meet with a negative or negative attitude.
I think it's best that people are disappointed.
"But then you will start smiling." Currently Anna Marešová has a vibrator on which you can leave a personal message, and this year she is also planning her own lubricant gel.
The next year should be the vibrating egg and other news.
Limits on healthy sex
I wonder where the limits of what's right are.
Is there anything Martin Raj wouldn't sell anymore?
It's hard to define.
When it comes to normal, it may seem completely abnormal to one another, so we're going to demarcate ourselves with a range of brand manufacturers.
None of them can afford any extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have the last question: What was the crazyst request they received?
Right now, an e-mail came in a week in which some lady asked for Masturbation aid for her boyfriend with a length of 20 centimeters.
So we had to write that we had nothing like that.
It's still a question of whether one of us has made a joke," Martin says in a suspicious look.
And it happens from time to time...
A wound to Karl Gott.
Two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Karel Szedra is fighting a serious illness.
Carl Gott's best friend is fighting a disease that robs people of all memories.
"Yes, it's unfortunately true," confirmed the sad information Bleska himself singer.
I know about my illness, and so far, in view of the circumstances, I can handle it completely.
"I take drugs that have the underlying effects of disease slow down," he added, thanking him for his close support.
The entire developmental family has come to make Karl's life easier.
Eva's wife is trying to be home as much as she can, after her father's home on the White Mountain, even the daughters of the first marriage of Zuzana and Teresa, are taking care of the son of Karl, who is called Carlos.
He fought cancer twice and gave his experience to Slavik to support him in his difficult treatment.
He's got sixty chemotherapy behind him.
He was able to get back to work and to the tennis court and to the ski resorts.
"From an astrologer, I'm supposed to be here in the '90s," said Karel Blesk.
He's a fighter.
He's still looking forward to singing.
"I keep singing words so I don't forget them," said Karel.
He's fighting the same disease now in the constitution and the actress Flora Fial.
Do you have Alzheimer's patients in your family?
Look at how you treat him.
The Chilean Parliament has abolished the ban on interruptions, the U.S. law.
In Chile, there is an absolute ban on artificial abortion, therefore it must not be carried out for health reasons.
"I am sorry that the legislators have complained to the Constitutional Court and that ten people will now decide what we have agreed on in Parliament for more than two years," Socialist Senator Isabel Allende said.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and, at the end of August, a new President should be given, according to the AFP, a close opposition.
The Act breaking the absolute ban of interruptions, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, approved the Senate on 19 July.
The legal opposition then announced that the law would attack the court because it violated the right of an unborn child to life.
The Members of the vote on the bill postponed last month until it was examined by the Joint Parliamentary Commission.
On Wednesday, the MPs approved the proposal and did so again to the Senate.
According to the new legislative amendment, there should be no criminal articulation of pregnancy in three cases: if the life of a woman is threatened, if the fruit has no hope of survival, or if pregnancy has arisen from rape.
Similar exceptions existed, according to the Spanish newspaper El País, Chile, since 1931, even before women were elected in 1949.
The absolute ban on interruption in 1989 was imposed by the right dictator Augusto Pinochet, only a few months before leaving the president's office.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where an absolute ban on interruption is applied.
Others are Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
For example, in Salvador, there are now about 20 women on the network, who suffer up to 30 years of imprisonment for the interruption of pregnancy.
In many cases, however, it was according to human rights defenders of spontaneous kidnapping, which the court considered to be murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
With Trump's White House there's now Socha Freedom
The unmistakable sign of change in the regime is the criticism of the soch.
The Americans could report on this as well as all the others - see the carefully enhanced impact of Saddam Hussajna on the Bay of Firdos in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of Trump's regime, certainly knew what was involved when, during a heated debate with CNN reporter Jim Acost on the theme of presidential proposals for the drastic restriction of legal immigrants, he expressed himself as a symbolic anchor on Sochu Freedom.
It's good to add that Miller didn't attack the soybeans like that.
For that, he would be thrown away by a crowd of shipowners and followers of Socha Freedom.
However, he attacked its importance, namely the fact that in 1903 the plaque was placed on the ground with the famous poem Emmy Lazarus, up to 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller praised Acousta for saying: “I don’t want to go to history here, but Socha Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the whole world.
The poem that was placed on the ground in addition, and which you refer to, is not part of it."
Miller's actually right, but as he said himself, this isn't about history.
This is especially about the fascinating words of Emmy Lazarus, who reason today - not only calls them immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go.
And in modern times we can better watch these "sick worms" on our screens than ever before.
Miller did not try to criticize poetry - he wanted to explain that these people are not welcome in the United States.
This conflict on the importance of soybean is part of a major political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict on the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends who, after her death, tried to place a poster with a poet on the base of the soybeans, knew quite well that they would be allowed to play a high political game.
Socha was supposed to express the association of the French and American Republican governments by representing a classical theme, that is, women's enjoyment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem there is not a female figure abstract, but she has her own voice.
He also has a very different name: the mother of the outcasts.
Embracement with a woman’s imagination is a brilliant feminist attraction and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the soybeans, researchers have long been trying to reverse this significance.
Famous commentator Rush Limbaugh - Jana Kristitel argued in the matter of Trump's entry into power in 2010 that Socha Freedom does not actually call anyone to the country, but represents early neoconstructiveism, bringing the American flame to the rest of the world: “Socha Freedom goes ahead.
It brings the origin of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The origin shall not shed light on the journey to the United States."
Limbuugh buys up on an important thing.
The importance of the juice depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the soch from the sight of the exhausted and lost traveler, who often after a long and frightening voyage across the ocean comes with hope in the heart of a new country.
It is literally a world view of people who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view, he expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that's, of course, a perspective that Miller or Trump will definitely not know.
Their origins should not illuminate the path, but spread hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Championship in the 2017 Athletics: Neil Black sings praise to the Scottish members of the British team
Elid Doyle recalls when the British team had only two Scottish members
The director of the United Kingdom's athletic federation Neil Black stated that a strong squad of 16 Scottishs in the World Championship team would be "a huge advantage for the team".
For MS in London 2017, starting on Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes was selected.
Black believes that in Scotland “something special is happening” and British athletes could learn from Scott.
"We are trying to understand and adapt - we will work on it," Black said.
“I spoke to people from the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has something to do with what they did.
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they've done.
British athletics: he has something to do with what they did.
He thinks people on the streets, too.
Whatever it is, it's amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will strive for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sirem Mo Farahem in the 5000 m race, while Elid Doyle was elected team captain.
“Eilid is humble.
Her opening speech was amazing," Black said.
“Several athletes, whether Scottish or athletes of other nationalities, came from a room with great pride and motivation.
The attitude and unscrupulous feelings Elid spoke to were unrepeatable."
The silver medalist Commonwealth, who will compete in the race across the 400 m obstacle in his fifth world championship, stated that it is "incredible", that in the British team there are 16 Scottish athletes.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
In the middle course, Muir has only established five British and two European records in the last year.
The MS will take part in the race at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scotts is Chris O'Hare, who runs a 1500-metre track. This season won British team races and Annual Games.
Doyle remembers his first championship, where she was the only other Scottish member of Lee McConnell's team.
The team's captain led to the "very proud" of the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues had joined the team, but in many cases they would also be attacked to participate in the finals and medals.
"It was a great honor for me, but aware that I was elected as a team member, it was a pleasure," she added.
“I’m obviously very proud of all the Scotts who got into the team.
It proves where I've moved.
They're athletes who'll think of the front seats on the podium.
And my opening speech?
Yes, I think she did.
I just pointed out that we can be proud of this year's championship because it's on home ground.
It is important to use the support of domestic fans and be glad that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I've got a second chance to compete, and I'm going to have an unrealized atmosphere."
Blocking criticisms on Facebook: don't worry about public function if you don't have a review of wishes
Our father knew about his criticism.
American George Washington loved it, but the press didn't take long to start criticizing it for anything, starting with foreign politics and ending his political opinions.
Yes, this criticism did not leave her cold.
But he did not try to silence criticism.
Because in 1783 Washington said: "Freedom of expression can be taken away - and stupid and we will be led as sheep for defeat."
That brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan who needs to work on starting acting like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and reduced the contributions of at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, she complained to the American Union for civil liberties.
The governor's staff rejected the complaint as unfounded, and in comments on the Internet, many views of the type "who is interested".
"It's just Facebook," said many users.
Still, it matters.
Especially when it's about people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, it is an extremely popular Republican governor.
It can be the second highest favorite of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not intoxicating.
As you can see, his state manages with certainty its own and adheres strictly to principles.
It has also proved to be a turning point in Facebook's use as the main means of connecting with its voters - except there is not even the publication of the first photo with a bare head after chemotherapy.
Blocking people who turn to the governor's page - which is a public forum, marked as official and managed by his employees paid by taxpayers - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In a discussion on Washington Post Hogan's journal, spokesperson Amelia Chase defended the governor with the fact that blocking comments took place from the post-moderating position of contributions.
However, using the image of Internet trolls, spammers or scattered people is too easy.
Washington Post told a number of real people who were cut off by contributions.
And they are also real people who speak to their chosen leaders; teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, no trolls.
As they all stated, their comments were fair and considerate, not redundancies.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his commentary, appealing to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani's lawyer, Md. asked for hate crimes, but her comment was not hate.
"I noticed, in fact, that I was disappointed with his lack of response to hate crimes and other current reports," the section wrote with the comments of the Washington Post newspaper.
"I don't like the idea that once a certain number of people have the same theme, some people are marked for the promotion of so-called collective effort rather than being regarded as a larger group of interested citizens."
What the governor's employees called "concentrated tax interest" would probably be called "obhajaboa".
Modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage contributions by blocking criticism or reducing negative comments.
It is much more comfortable than in the past, when the same procedure would require the sending of employees to the streets, where they would collect and burn all the prints with criticism or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that's exactly what's going on, just in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public player to be criticised for denouncing Facebook and other social media.
President Trump faces a complaint from Twitter users that has been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
President Louduun County Board of Supervisors broke the first supplement in Alexandria, according to periodic judge James C. Cachereise, where she banned one of her fans from accessing her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also attended a visit from ACLU on his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so difficult.
In Washington’s time, the low price of mail was practically the same as the internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of the daily printing press was quantified and its leader’s position questioned many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People who wrote under pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", wrote letters to the press and questioned Washington's decision.
According to historical documents, which gathered people in the online project Papers of George Washington Project, petitions were collected in his office criticizing his opinion on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain.
But he didn't shut up.
Freedom of expression, disagreement and intimidation lies in the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader must accept it.
The Czechs quickly used free roaming, they consume more data abroad than at home.
More of their tariffs than home are consumed abroad by Czechs.
Most often they move in Austria, but data consumption in the summer season leads Croatia.
On holiday, however, they have more time to browse the web, and under the sun, most do not have the option to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, bathroom and smart phone in your hand.
It looks like a typical Czech holiday in Croatia after customers can use the services of domestic operators.
This results from the fresh statistics of the company O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad have more data available under the breaker than at home.
It is not surprising, therefore, that in Croatia, where the minimum number of insects is driving in winter, the consumption of data in this summer season has risen even to 50 percent.
In the second place, Italy was then placed in the data sheet.
The most minute the Czechs are running from Germany, where many of them are out at work during the years.
According to the Czech Travel Office Association, Croatia visits 800 thousand Czechs annually, so is our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here exchanged a book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
The record was this July 7th.
"To the data transmitted, tens of millions of photographs would be included," explained details of the director of the mobile segment in O2 Silvia Cieslar.
Although Croatia manages the volume of data, the highest number of Czech users is moving in neighbouring countries.
In the first place is Austria, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy sixth.
We go to Austria as a tourist walk and as an active holiday, at which we don't have so much time for browsing the Internet.
"In addition to Austria, the Czech Republic is heading to the Adriatic," Cieslarová explained.
While the data showed the operator after the release of the roaming fees of high interim growth, the number of phone calls is much lower.
The number of minutes spent in roaming has increased from last year to two.
With a huge leap in front of other countries, Germany dominates here.
"Volations in roaming are more used by corporate customers on business routes," Cieslarová added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes in the home atmosphere at Renaissance Club
The former Ronan Rafferty golf team will be hoping for the next three days in the weather atmosphere at the Renaissance Club in the Scottish administrative area East Lothian, which hosts 25-year-old Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, last year at the nearby Archerfield Links golf course on his way to the finals, was under Paul Eales. This year he will play the role of the ambassador of the tournament in the presence of the founder of the club and CEO of Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched the Renaissance Club grow slowly in front of my eyes and this year's tournament will show the world its beauty," Rafferty said.
"The players will be able to love the first-class quality of the game.
Jerry did a great job.
He's a burning advocate of this game and he's proud of his achievements.
This year's tournament is in the right hand."
English Eales will first defend the master's title, despite the fact that during his 32-year career he won European Tour and European Challenge Tour.
"I feel good," said the Southport golfer.
“I did not have the chance to defend my victory at Extremadura Open, because the tournament was canceled one year after my victory.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It's a beautiful place for golf.
I remember last year when for me and my wife Sharon meant a real victory.
It was a beautiful time I didn't forget."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour, returns to his home country after 50 years of celebration this year.
This event will be his first participation from Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like playing on the home ground," Orr said about Helensburg.
“You want it to happen to you and then you feel a lot of pressure.
I really like playing again, and I think I'm doing it.
I'm happy with today's result."
The three players will also be joined by former winner Masters Ian Woosnam and senior tournaments Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former captain of the Ryder Cup Sam Torrence competition are among six Scottish players on the playground; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Access to the tournament is free. Parking is £5 per car with one passenger and £10 per car with two and more passengers.
All profits will be dedicated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Mushrooms and Death in the Indonesian Land of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
In fact, he's only rarely using a doll.
In its wooden chateau, located in the main city of Panai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply fits sweet potatoes - in the local "note" - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, let's take out the potato and taste it with your bare hands.
Bardina sits on a muddy ground - the house is not equipped with furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, such as washing laundry inakted water from a nearby swamp.
The hair in the room without the roof is supplied with the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, she was not assigned any treatment fields.
The polygamy is common here.
Work in late nights poses a danger: most men from the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In the village there are also soldiers.
"In the afternoon, at five o'clock, no one will be allowed to swim around the village," said Bardina.
It is a rare view of daily life on the height of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were voted in the form of a public raise in front of the occupying army.
The current protesting movement against the Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Jakart government, which ruled the entire region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights observers.
In 2003 the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - the independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and deserted city where you will arrive after a 90-minute flight from the capital of Jayapura to Nabira, and then a five-hour stomach carrying the ride.
There's no mass transport in this place.
The city with 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo plots, roofs of woolen spots in the shade of gray and cutting colors.
Only a very few Indonesians, including journalists, and virtually no foreigners, were seen in this place.
Before the arrival of Christians, the local inhabitants worshipped the God named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We were not used to wearing these dresses," says Bardina, showing her colorful, hand-painted turbane, dark shirt and bright skirt.
"We used to wear only sheets."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line and the present child mortality and obesity is one of the worst in the whole of Asia.
At the same time, it's an Indonesian country of gold.
The largest and most profitable gold piece in the world of Grassberg, which owns Freeport McMoran from the American Phoenix, is only 60 miles from Panai - a rocky province about the size of New Jersey, which is home to about 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport spent $3.1 billion on gold and copper.
In addition, the Pope supports the worth of wood worth $78 billion estimated.
However, for the Pope, these riches are a source of suffering and a guarantee of the suppression of the powerful Indonesian army.
From the investigation carried out in 2005 by the New York Times, Freeport has paid local military agents and units approximately $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one officer.
The popes calling for self-government are threatening this golden goose and are therefore severely oppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 popes have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, imprisoned, and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass killings in the Papui tribal area during the 70th century amounted to genocide, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
In Will Lose Everything, a report by the British archdiocese of 2016, describes the cruelty that occurred last year, such as extrajudicial corrections, torture - according to another report is particularly popular violence and correction by electric currents - and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrators.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims, because incidents occur every week," said Andreas Harrison, an Indonesian research worker from the Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation has upset the fact that the papal sources attract colonists to Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% are reporting Christianity, but demography changes with the rise of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Java, Bornea, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gad or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
"Immigrants began selling chicken and vegetables on traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans," explains 40-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Panai and moved to the capital of Jayapura.
"The natives of Papuy - mother-mom (women) - lost their jobs."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo, named Jokovi, promised to solve injustice and violation of rights in his presidential campaign in 2014.
The former treasurer has secured his way to the Presidential Palace in the castle of 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Panai.
But in Papua, this has changed very little and local people feel hurt.
"Our hearts were broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwio, hoping to hear our call for justice," you said.
In fact, only two months after the October inauguration of Jacob, Panai experienced a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang the Christmas song at camp fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers on motorbikes came out at night.
Two of the surprised children told them they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers took this hill and the one that was charged with touching and later returned with four other soldiers, introduced local shepherd Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in a subterfuge followed a group of children and left them with their weapons, led the victims and the witnesses.
One of the soldiers then set fire to a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
In a few hours later, someone burned down the building of the electoral commission and the next day things were still going on.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered at the football court in front of the local police station and the military authorities and demanded justice.
They came with the solemn fishing ports and performed the dance of the Waita - where it runs in the circle and resembles the singing of birds - the Papuan tribe of Mee Pago.
Several Protestants started throwing stones at the building.
With increasing tension, a command was issued to the soldiers via the radio: “If the crowd tries to resist at least three times, you are allowed to shoot”, according to the TIME weekly, a document whose content has never been published in local media.
Jeremias Kayame (56), head of the district of Enarotali Kego Koto, identified the dangerous danger and called on the inhabitants to disperse into their homes.
But no one had a clue about his words.
“When I turned around, someone shot me in the left armpit,” said Time Week on the porch of his painted wooden house.
Kayame doesn't know who the shooter was, but according to his word, she belonged to a bullet in one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people everywhere and a lot of shooting," he added.
One of the local residents, Alfius Youw, was killed three times, according to his cousin, who was a witness of the shooting.
"I was running to the body to make sure it was really him," said the Times weekly with a sad voice by John, who uses only one name as a lot of Indonesians.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
The Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers were only "supplying" the station that was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us with death," said Pudi Sulistio, a press spokesman for the Papuan police in 2015.
"It's a question of life and death."
According to the Human Rights Watch, five protestants were killed and many were expelled from the scene.
The murder report was filed by the Jakart media the following day.
About three weeks later, Jokovi gave a passionate speech to Jayapura and expressed his understanding of the victims' families and promised to deal with the violence in Papua.
"I demand immediate solutions to this problem so that it can never repeat itself," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of National Security, Viranto, announced that he would introduce an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve the violent acts that occurred in the past.
Almost immediately, however, they began to apologize.
“Most of the violent acts have been committed in a long time.
Some of them occurred in the 1990 ’ s and some in the early 21st century.
I mean, we're deciding to punish these violent acts, but it won't be a simple task," he said.
In an interview on 5 June for the TIME week that took place in Jakarta, Viranto claimed that he did not plan to take any measures in Papua.
Instead, it says that “all cases will be brought before the Court”.
Viranto, accused by the United Nations of “crime against humanity” on the basis of more than one thousand dead during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, stated that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua New Guinea, including the Pania incident, had been settled so far.
The families of the victims of the gunshots in Panai welcomed his claim with disbelief.
“In the last three years I have been questioned four times, but I have not yet seen anything,” John said.
"I'm tired."
As he says, a few years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says himself.
"I'm afraid an army will arrest me or somebody will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many Panai inhabitants who are afraid to speak about the incident.
According to him, he was beaten by members of the army after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After the body was buried, I started looking for an army," he said.
And there's no shooting yet.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighboring Deiyai.
In the event that one person died and another 17 were injured, there was a complaint between the villagers and the construction company manager, who refused to provide assistance in the transport of a man to the hospital unconscious.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested against the building company.
According to police statements, the villagers threw stones at them and responded to them were a firefight.
However, local residents claim that the mobile brigade (indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the dome and killed one person.
"There was panic, we were afraid of paying off," told the 29-year-old Domingg Badii, who lived near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the wounded.
"I haven't left the house in two days."
The Deiyai Parliament called for the prosecution of the police involved and the removal of the mobile brigade from the area.
The ladies were always looking at the Indonesian government.
Lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of the indigenous peoples of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in central high places.
Many of them joined the Pope’s Liberation Movement (OPM) - the army of rebels who protect the rights of the Pope by attacking and destroying Indonesian policemen.
Some of the leaders of the OPM come from Panai, among them not Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the army has been arrested in recent years and has voluntarily detained thousands of Panais, all under the command of "national sovereignty".
Some of them don't belong anymore.
Panai is known among the people of Papua as "a tragic and forgotten place".
Oil into the fire brings poverty.
The little rice that is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
And bread is as inconvenient as it is.
The people here are growing their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruit and leaf vegetables.
Women work on the fields; each of them deals with four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most of the tiles are intended for family needs, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport opened several air routes and new immigrants began to flow to the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between the Papuans and immigrants.
There are so few jobs that usually include more educated and richer immigrants.
The Popes rarely have the necessary capital and education to let them go to business.
"Young people move from villages due to a lack of job opportunities and money," said John Gobai, Chairman of the Pania Family Council.
Thanks to isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
They also contribute to strict rules for foreign journalists.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were kicked out of the Pope's office because of the lack of cooperation with the authorities, despite the fact that they were given so rare permission to film.
Phelim China, Asia's director of Human Rights Watch, Jokovi, in his election campaign promised to abolish strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development. However, this never happened.
"For foreign journalists working in the most rebellious regions of Papua New Guinea and Papua New Guinea, there is a great risk: not knowing visas and entering a blacklist," he stated in a statement.
Lack of reports from foreign journalists means that the international pressure on Indonesia in the matter of Papua is significantly limited.
In March, six Pacific nations were ordered - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council on the investigation of "different and extended acts of violence" in Papua New Guinea, including shooting in Pania.
These countries in the past also supported the OPM.
The Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir accused reporters in Jakarta of saying: "In Indonesia, the democratic system and the media are still free, so it is difficult to mask evidence of human rights violations."
Local people call after foreign governments are involved.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, in front of the human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local people were doing according to the source, which also attended the meeting, but wanted to remain anonymous, the word "we want freedom".
For 2019 there are other elections planned in Indonesia, but the popes claim that they will not vote for Jokovi.
"Joko is a man who has good intentions, but is surrounded by people involved in the shooting in Panai," said Gobau, the president of the tribal council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the people of Panai - other than living in constant fear of the plundering army - are fighting in poverty, poor education and the health system.
The Gobai claims that the people of Panai, as well as the other Popes, consider their voice to be "debt", which Jokov must pay.
"They don't want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite threats and threats to the family of the victims of the Paniian shootings, they continue in the last symbolic act of defeat: burying the bodies of the victims on the ground against the police and the army station.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least it will not allow responsible persons to forget their crimes.
"He killed a member of our family," said Yacobus with his head closed.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy caught a huge delivery of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy held a 1,46 tons of cocaine in the Pacific, worth about $256 million.
The shipper was heading to Australia.
The four-member crew of the ship, apparently made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia, was arrested.
Jachta, named after Afalina, sailed from South America and the police took her to port in Nouméa, a metropolis of the French overseas New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean after detention.
The Australian Intelligence Service stated that in cooperation with its international partners, it would strive to determine exactly where and where the drugs were being directed and to reveal the "limitian syndicate".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures that have stopped a large number of drugs targeting Australia," her executive director Col Blanch said.
The drugs were destroyed this week in Noumé.
Australia is an attractive target for its passengers because of high street prices.
The country is also facing the problem of increasing numbers of people suffering from drug addiction.
That's not the first time in the past.
Last month, three men were accused of transporting a large amount of drugs from the United States to Australia, which tried to penetrate the Pacific in a small plane.
They don't feel thirsty, they need to be reminded of drinking.
The problem may be in homes for seniors, according to a doctor at the Geriatric Clinic, the General Faculty Hospital in Prague Pavly Mádlová could be an infusion of the physiological solution that is dripping with this needle under the skin.
But they're still only applied in medical devices.
The older the person, the lower the amount of water in his body.
"In addition, they lose the feeling of thirst, so the elderly generally accept less fluid and they dehydrate very quickly," Mådlová said.
Two liters should drink for sure.
"But getting to the old man so much fluid is a big problem," she added.
In nursing homes, there is often no doctor who cares about it.
In hospitals, dehydration is usually done by infusions.
"I think there should be a gradual introduction to get subcutaneous infusion," she said.
According to it, old people can add up to two half litres of physiological solution per day.
Lack of fluid may cause nausea, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration appears to be a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day that old man will say he can't get out of bed, he's talking confused," she added.
In the event of neglect, it may occur until the brain occurs.
Blood will be stopped and the bowel in the brain, also threatens renal failure.
Lieting patients should not be covered by a pen, which should be covered by a maximum of cotton.
The problem can also be one-time prey.
"It's more curative, but it would be ideal for the patient to occasionally discover and let the skin explode," the doctor said.
In Dubai, the Torch was burning a second nightmare.
In Dubai on Friday, one of the world's largest residential nightmares was set in flames. The Hasicians had to evacuate all inhabitants 337 meters high and 79 patrol buildings.
In the last two years, the second fire of this tall building, which bears the appropriate name The Torch (Arch).
All the inhabitants of the building were evacuated and there was no injury. The cause of the fire is unknown.
"We slept and woke up the alarm. We heard a scream.
It took us ten minutes before we ran down from the 50th floor," said Reuters Geroge, one of the people of the nightmares.
The Dubai Civil Defence stated that fires were being made under control around the fourth hour of the morning (0:00 GMT), which continued in the cooling of the building.
Government representatives have added that they provide replacement accommodation for the affected population.
The incident could again lead to discussions on the safety of materials used to build high buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation, which led to the conduct of the Torch cloud after the fire in 2015, revealed that the most damage to the coating and the external panels used for decoration or insulation had been caused.
The British police stated that the system of isolation and siege of the London Grenfell Tower could contribute to the rapid spread of fire at the red fire, where nearly 80 people were killed.
The results of the survey showed that more than one of the five U.S. passengers carries prohibited items on board the aircraft
A survey among passengers showed that more than 20 percent of them were knowingly or unconsciously banned via the U.S. government agency Transportation Security Administration on board the aircraft. At least six percent of passengers entered the aircraft with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of the passengers claim to have found that they were late traveling with guns, ammunition, or explosives.
From the results of the survey carried out by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - which responded to more than 1000 respondents - it appeared that in younger travelers there is a higher likelihood of violations of the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they deliberately tried to travel with the object prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 per cent of passengers with several thousand hours of flying compared to less than 15 per cent of the X-generation members.
Among the most common items that have escaped TSA attention are food and alcohol.
More than three per cent of respondents were aware of the acute issue, while 2.2 per cent of the women and 3.7 per cent of the men in question also admitted that they deliberately brought the prohibited drugs on board the aircraft.
The company stated that it was carrying out a survey among passengers around the world to find out how many of them were accidentally detected and how many were approved.
It is not surprising that most people who have carried unauthorized objects - whether knowingly or unconsciously - travel by plane very often.
As the company pointed out, the TSA Directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don't know what fluids and how much they can carry to the plane.
It is not surprising, then, that the TSA has played the most highly prohibited fluid.
For a certain time, people thought that TSA would lay books in the same way as the stuff used.
The transfer of fluids is permitted in foreign flights, not international flights.
Head of EPA Scott Pruitt on deferral of planned guidelines to reduce Obama's administrative emissions
After the Environmental Protection Agency was sued by fifteen states, her former head, Scott Pruitt, withdrew its decision to postpone the implementation of the plan by the former Obama administration to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt has introduced changes within his plan. He reacts more mildly than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge raised against his previous position in the Federal Court of Appeal.
This applies to the last deadline set on 1 October when Member States are to comply with the 2015 Regulation to reduce the amount of ground ozone.
In June, Pruitt announced that the agreement would be postponed for one year and ordered a more detailed study of the plan to avoid "local decisions or threat of economic growth".
Pruitt, who, prior to reaching the role of Head of the EPA President Donald Trump, held the position of Public Prosecutor General Oklahoma, served for a long time as a reliable supporter of stricter environmental regulations.
Since he settled in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or removed regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
The violent middle-school movement is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA operator exceeded its authority in order to delineate the integration of Obama's administrative plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed his version of the ozone standards and strengthened the EPA's commitment to cooperation with countries through complex processes and the implementation of new standards in the given timeframe.
“The previous EPA administration often did not meet the deadlines and waited for it to be complained about by the activist groups and others, agreeing with the alignment and other plans,” said Pruitt, who submitted more than a dozen complaints to the EPA in his previous position.
"We do not believe in regulation by means of judicial dispute and we take the deadline seriously.
We never consider our statute and authority that comes out of it."
However, the EPA declaration states that Pruitt may, at a certain point, use "the possibility of extension and all other legally available authorities" to ensure that the regulations "will be based on sound policy and the most accessible information".
The Republicans at the Congress press for a broader revision of the ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month aims to postpone implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years.
The action has not yet been passed by the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who was in front of the coalition of states who complained this week of the EPA, stated that the group was not going to allow legal pressure.
"To address the views of the EPA - following our judgment over - is an important victory for the health and safety of those 6.7 million neo-virgins and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman added.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Ground ozone occurs when the common harmful substances released by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and every year and thousands of premature deaths.
Public health advocates and environmentalists welcome Pruitt's sudden change.
"It is worrying what pressure it takes to develop to change the thinking of responsible people and to protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd from the Biodiversity Centre.
"We must continue to fight the ideological quest for Trump's administration, which is trying to help polluters and special interests."
The policing of men with acidic acid, however, is not dangerous according to the court.
You never know what can happen to you.
In one moment, you're home with your family and you laugh, in the other, your whole life will suddenly change from base to base.
And the worst part is that you can't do anything about it.
A similar fate met with Andreas Christopherose from Great Britain, whose face was struck with acid by an unknown attacker, who was finally released from guilt.
The information was introduced by web Reuters.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the door at Christopheros.
Andreas woke up to open up.
He thought there was probably a courier at the door who was supposed to deliver the Christmas gift for the family that day.
Instead, there was a cruel surprise waiting for him.
A man he never saw in his life, immediately after opening his eyes without warning, he said, "This is for you, my friend."
The pain was unfathomable.
The clothes fell on me like nothing, and I just felt a little pain on my skin," Andreas said.
His family quickly took him to the hospital, but his neighbors learned a terrible message - according to doctors, he had no chance to survive.
Several weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patient would be subjected to an infection that threatened to enter his wound.
His injury was very serious.
Of the 90 percent, a face was struck, which the doctors tried to bring together by means of skin from other parts of the body.
The loss of eyelids has become a major complication for Christopheros.
It's probably the most painful thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described his suffering.
Today Christopheros has twelve operations behind him, which are far from the last.
The injuries caused by acidic attacks may require hundreds of surgical advances and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after demanding and long-term treatment, the victims have tissue cut off for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't worry and struggle with deformation and deformation throughout their lives," said Professor Peter Dzewulski, a British oral association of plastic and aesthetic surgeons.
The attacker's confused.
As for the attack, Christophers is sure that an unknown man had to deal with someone.
Pachael believed that he was the man who sexually abused his close friend.
The police searched the entire case properly, and the attacker went after.
The man was initially sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
Later, however, the verdict to the glory of Christopher’s family changed substantially.
"The three judges finally reached the conclusion that punishment should be abolished because man is not considered a threat to the public," said Christopheros.
In the last few years, the number of attacks on the liver has grown significantly.
The Ministry of the Interior expressed itself in a way that it plans to establish new guidelines to state representatives regarding the classification of giraffes.
You should be listed among the dangerous weapons.
However, victims of similar attacks are not willing to give up.
They demand that the government of the United Kingdom tolerate more severe and longer sentences of freedom to people who attack their surroundings with acid or other nutrients.
They also require enhanced controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often used to be supplied in different trades, as they are different means of cleaning.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai burned at night the famous nightmare The Torch, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense, the inhabitants of the 80-foot building were able to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to the spokesperson, the Dubai police fired a fire on the ninth floor and spread it up.
However, according to a number of residents, it was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, so they told us," said one of the tenants.
According to another tenant quoted by the Reuters agency, fire broke out in the highest ranks and spread down with falling burning concerns.
We slept.
He woke us up, people screamed.
"We ran down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes for the 50th floor," said the tenant George.
Another witness for CNN estimated that the flames had taken up about 40 flats.
On the ground fire destroyed at least two cars when they were hit by the burning parts of the building.
At least two hours after the civil defence was notified, a fire was sent under control.
The cause of his creation is not yet known.
According to the witnesses in the surrounding buildings, there was a flow.
The vast fire damaged the Dubai mrakodrap The Torch also in February 2015, destroyed over a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the entire building.
Nothing happened back then, because the residents managed to evacuate in time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and then became its 352 meters tallest residential building world.
The record was immediately prepared by another dubian nightmare next year.
The culturalist had 14 incredible doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, in a sample of 30-year-old Ippolita, there was a stack of illicit drugs - from steroids through diuretics after Parkinson’s disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, this wild mix didn't help him with his title, finished his fourth.
Now culturalists are threatened with four years of distance and criminal harassment.
The record was 11.
Last year, the Italian ragbiist Davide Vasta was tested positively for 11 doping substances, which was a record number of athletes caught up in the past.
According to his words, the third player started taking steroids a year ago when he was a culturalist.
Lucka Vondračka, Czech Republic.
She really hugged an ex-girlfriend!
Almost Lucka Vondračka stepped into the territory of the Czech Republic, it's in one round.
And he pays attention wherever he comes.
Last time she got into her arms, her former lover, Michal Longy, who lived with her for three years.
He was 12 years old at the time, and he was looking for his family.
Lucii was only 19 years old then and certainly did not apply to hang her career on a grave.
So they walked away, but the friends stayed until today.
Which they also proved at the TV Prima press conference, where they met for a long time.
Sodo's random, they both agreed to the blue color.
At first, they didn't notice themselves, but then they got close, and Lucie laughed at Michael's victims when she fell in the belly.
Then they hugged the photographers and gladly invited them.
However, their meetings were not an accident, so they are playing together a charity couple in the new Primy Captain Exner series.
In Britain, the Islamics received their lives for the preparation of the assassination.
On Thursday, the British court sent four members of an Islamic cell to live on the network, who were called Three Musketeers and the prosecutors said they were planning a terrorist attack on the police and the army.
Four men, two of whom took part in the training camp in Pakistan and were previously convicted of similar consequences, were arrested in August.
The authorities then thought he was going to attack immediately.
In one man's car, security agents found a partially finished tube bomb, knives with inscriptions that in Arabic mean "unbeliever", and a machine gun.
It happened at a time when the MI5 secret service agent put the listening device in the car.
"The recent assassinations showed how terrible the charges could be if they weren't stopped," prosecutor Sue Hemming said.
Three sentences at the age of 28, 25 and 33 may apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth convicted person, who is 38 years old, can do so after 15 years behind the net.
The men in London during the trial declared that they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car put agent MI5 in there.
The court also heard it, but then rejected the accused's claim.
Thursday was the warmest day of the year.
They measured 38.3 °C in Hodoninsk.
The internal temperature record of 37.3 degrees of Celsia remained on top for only two days.
From 38,3 degrees Celsius, which were recorded in the Watch Tower in Hodoninsk, it was surpassed by Thursday, which has become the warmest day of this year.
This was confirmed by the employees of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
On Tuesday, however, not many heat records fell on Thursday.
On Tuesday, the records of 35 of the 145 meteorological stations measured over 30 years were exceeded or corrected.
On Thursday, record temperatures were recorded for only nine long measuring stations.
It is estimated that in The Watchtower the temperature was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In the Lednica in Brèclavska Thursday, 37,4 degrees exceeded the initial maximum by four degrees and in the Horns in Brníńsk the current 37,1 degrees exceeded the record by three degrees.
Both records as well as the Watch Tower came from 2013.
In the west, it was ten degrees less.
High temperatures appeared on Thursday mainly on the south and east of Moravia.
After the Watchtower was the largest lead in the Dyjakovici in Znojemska and Brodza nad Dyj na Břclavska, where the mercury was appropriately sprayed to 37.8 degrees, but the record did not exceed.
On the contrary, for example, in Western and North-West Czechs, the ČHMU web site has so far been the fourth highest temperature only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures there began to grow until this afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current climate in the Czech Republic will gradually decline according to the CHMMU, and more rains may occur on Sunday.
Most Moravy places will remain high temperatures on Fridays and in the south-east of Moravia on Saturdays.
China lacks tourists.
Beijing's visa policy is worth billions.
China has been trying to apply its influence for decades without the use of force.
Each year, she spends $10 billion on supporting language schools and building universities abroad, pushing her entertainment industry into foreign markets and trying to attract Western tourists.
But that's not gonna happen to Beijing.
The dark state media are talking about the plan to make tourism a force for economic change and modernisation.
However, the number of arrivals increased by only 3.8% last year, and about 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
It is adapted, inter alia, that despite all its global aspirations China does not welcome foreigners directly with open arms, assessing the situation in the world's most popular country professor of economics from the Beijing University of Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for everything is the Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have a wireless contact with China, citizens of those other countries have to arrange a visa with the front.
The Chinese authorities in the United States are therefore comparable to the Chinese New Year's celebrations.
The visa is $140, but if a person does not want to wait for a long time in the front, he has to pay $100 and more for additional services.
Such restrictions create significant economic barriers.
Study Journal of Economics and Finance has shown that the need for visas reduces the number of visitors in the country by 70 per cent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which shares less than three percent of China's gross domestic product and lives there less than one percent of all inhabitants, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens this problem itself by using tourism to achieve its political objectives, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China in the spring restricted transport to South Korea in a crack around the South Korean missile system, the South Koreans paid it and China avoided it.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 per cent, while Japan recorded an 85 per cent increase.
All of this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recent report published by the US Central Bank, the Fed could leave China as a result of Chinese foreign travels up to $190 billion, while China will earn about $35 billion annually as part of its currency sales to tourists coming to China.
According to official figures on the development of the balance of payments, China had a deficit of $217 billion last year in tourism, which is equal to 44 per cent of the total Chinese surplus in trade in goods.
A small number of tourists, that is, a country that is anxiously defending the flow of capital, is causing a very painful wound.
However, the above factors are only one indication of the general sustainability of foreigners.
In many places in China, virtually no one has heard about immigrants.
In 2013, less than a million foreigners lived throughout China.
There are more of them in the United States and some individual cities.
And Japan, which is not exactly the crossroads of immigration, has a double.
A number of scientific work, however, shows that immigrants usually revive economic growth, business and innovation.
But you can't practically find them in China.
To solve these problems will be politically challenging, but the step that is being taken is to simplify the visa system.
Other Asian states, particularly India and Vietnam, have recently made a great effort to simplify and improve visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard coins, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Plzeň Zoo, there were deadly poisoned beaches.
The Plzeň Kingdom I am able to enjoy the youth of three rare, deadly beaches.
In the exhibition, visitors will see only nine freshly born Turkish snakes.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, which is also 2000 metres above sea level.
"It's also rising in meter length," said the speaker zoo Martin Vobruba.
Youths of the other two species, mortals and cobras red, will so far take power in the garden's pasture.
We still can't tell when people will see them.
"We would hate to see them," said Dr. Miroslav Dohnal, saying that it could take a year or two.
Australia's snake mortals have come into the world eight, they're descendants of a breeding couple from a population around Sydney.
"The only thing visitors can see at the exhibition belongs to mortals from around Perth," said Vobruba, saying that in human care it is necessary for more mortal wintering for 6-8 weeks at 13 degrees Celsius.
The percentage of success has been achieved by a dream of African swimming cobras red.
A couple in the pulsary zoo were cut out of four eggs, a total of four young people.
"The incubation lasted 65 days," added Vobruba.
This species in the wild is spraying poison on its victims, up to four meters away.
He's looking at his eyes, he can tell when he's blind.
Young people of all three species live in the zoo with mice.
Within 40 days in the garden, they still expect the hatching to be young from the dream of a black mom, eggs are stored in the incubator.
According to an unconfirmed phone call transfer, Trump creates pressure on Mexico for payment for the border wall
The American newspaper Washington Post published a rewriting of President Trump's phone calls with leading representatives of Mexico and Australia.
In a telephone interview of 27 January with Mexican President Enrique Peño Neem, Trump ordered her to stop announcing that she would not pay for the building of the proposed wall.
The American president explained to him that he was publicly condemning the building of the wall, allegedly saying, "You can't talk like this in the press."
Trump, within his campaign, promised to build a wall along the southern border and announced that he would pay Mexico for it.
He also lost his first call to the public with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, revealing a rapid exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. refugee surveillance agreement towards Australia was "smiley" and "munny" and insisted that if he agreed with such an agreement - which became President Obama's government - he would look like "druged" after he proposed a ban on the entry of refugees into the U.S.
Trump ended the call after he explained to Turnbull that "this is my most unpleasant call of the day".
The press again spoke to the prosecutor about Smolensk.
"There's nothing to worry about," Tusko declared at the address of the brother of the dead president, President of the Government of Law and Justice PiS Jaroslaw Kaczynski.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczynski doesn't scare me," Tusk told the country's current leadership that he is trying to abuse justice against political opponents.
At the departure of the prosecutor's office, he was waiting on Tuska according to TV 24 crowd who was blackmailing Donald Tusk! and wanted politics for 100 years!.
Tusk thanked me for his support and assured me that he had a clean conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczynski will not scare me."
According to the prosecutors, he doesn't count anything, but he doesn't doubt that justice now has to serve as a tool against opponents, opposition or people who don't like it, and I'm afraid I belong to this group.
It's been a while since the hearing.
Expremiér was questioned at the prosecutor's office on a number of occasions, this time he had an inquiry into the doubts about the drinking of the victims of the murky disaster.
In addition, the body was replaced in cancer.
The families were forbidden to open the shells, and there must have been some reason for that.
And the reason was that they were afraid of scandal because he would make Polish-Russian relations difficult.
"Maintaining good relations at all costs, despite such terrible events, should serve to make Donald Tusk a very important person in the EU," Kaczynski said on the Catholic television Durwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would stifle Tusko's chances of obtaining the most important chair in the Union, of which Poland has absolutely nothing.
At the same time, Kaczyn declared that he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that Donald Tuske might have had it different, but she didn't take it for granted.
The Tusk has conducted an eight-hour investigation at the Public Prosecutor's Office on 19 April.
He didn't even speak as a suspect, just as a witness.
However, many of his pre-elections considered part of the obvious efforts of the Polish government and the chief of PiS Kaczynski to discredit Tuska as a political rival in connection with various scandals.
The Prosecutor's Office shall be chaired by the Minister of Justice in Poland, who shall act as the Prosecutor-General.
The appeal for an inquiry came after Tuska's election by the head of the European Council, which Kaczyński tried hard but tried to prevent, inter alia, Merkel's visit to Warsaw.
At the EU summit against the extension of Tusko's mandate, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová protested alone.
In this case, the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán left Warsaw in the canteens.
Barma and Senegal.
Where can the Czechs choose everywhere?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, the registered voters will be able to vote again on the composition of the library from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections in 2013.
It comes from a statement that regulates the delivery of voting cards abroad.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared its updates, currently in a comment.
Four years ago, MEPs were elected to the ten thousand Czech citizens abroad.
"Since the latest renewal of the report in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the Ministry argues.
"In some countries new representative offices have been created, some offices have been closed, there has been a change in the level of representation," it says in the material.
The statement shall contain two annexes, the first of which shall be provided by the representative authorities to which the ballot papers are delivered.
This group includes the Czech Republic's presence in neighbouring countries, namely Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will get a ballot card in print version.
It's their list that's changing.
Four years ago, the Czechs were able to choose for example at the Czech embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Both embassies are closed today.
The Czech Republic also abolished its representation in the Malagasy Bamak and Japanese Kyoto.
He won't even be elected at the Consulate General in Doneck.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 for the war in eastern Ukraine.
They are on the list of embassies in Kenyan Nairobi, Senegal's capital Dakar and Zambia's Lusace.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has extended its representation on the General Consulate in Irbil and Čcheng-tu, the capital of the Chinese province of S'Chchuan.
Voting cards will also be available for registered voters in Czech embassys in Barmá and Cambodia.
The Czechs have had the opportunity to elect MPs in the election rooms at representative offices or consulates for the past four times.
Before any election, the national electoral commission shall, by fate, determine the country for which candidates are voted abroad.
This was the first time in 2002, when a decision was made between the Yugoslav candidates.
In the following two elections, the Czechs were elected abroad among the Yugoslav candidates.
As was the case in 2013, the Centralised Region was selected as this year.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is rising steadily.
At the premiere 15 years ago, about 3800 people came to vote, in 2006 they were around 6700, four years later 8222.
To the early elections four years ago, 10,571 voters were delivered to the embassy.
Moore's Ford Bridge Massacre: Activists recalled racist lynching
Ford Mercury from 1948 traveled around the nearby inhabitants of Monroe, Georgia, and cobbled towards the Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car with four black passengers and the white driver had enough to reach the bridge, a group of white men had built his way.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a trained suit - came out of a cigarette and sat on the front glass of the car.
Inside, the passengers were terrified.
"We want that n--a Roger!" cried the man.
"Bring him to me!"
Quietly break the tail of a young black man who is pulled out of the seat of the companion.
Fortunately, this scene is just a reconstruction event that occurred on July 22nd.
But if one of the men passes through Roger's neck, the obstetrical will inspire excitement.
Since 2005, there has been a regular return to Moore's Ford group of activists who rebuild it on the fate night of 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - killed members of Kukluxklan.
No one's been tried for murder so far.
"It is surprising that in all those years no one person has been arrested - although we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity," Tyrone Brooks, who helps to organize the reconstruction of the event, said.
"It is a snare to our history and burden to our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman in the state of Georgia and a life-long warrior for civil rights.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event represents a dramatic challenge to the event. Every year, the Monroe community recalls that justice was not done enough.
"We demand judicial appeal and closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all," Brooks said.
"Until then, the healing and reconciliation process cannot be initiated."
The judge covers one of Moore's Ford's victims on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI reports received from NBC News, the lynching was to take part in up to 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding periods.
But no one has been reached so far.
Although suspects remain for decades at liberty, citizens' rights advocates claim that both reasons of lynching - politics and sex - were known to all city dwellers.
In April 1946, on the basis of the decision of the Supreme Court, black people in the state of Georgia had the first right to participate in the elections planned for the summer.
And right during the summer elections, according to the FBI, the farmer of the black spot Roger Malcom had to stab the owner of the white spot Barnett Hester - allegedly because of his wife.
According to Brooks, he was betrayed to take care of Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and brought her to a different state.
According to the FBI, on 25 July 1946, the then significant landowner of the white plait Loy Harrison for Malcolm's bail amounted to $600.
Dorothy and Mae Murray and George Dorsey took him to prison.
When they returned from the prison, just before they got to the Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects built their way.
"As it turned out, the murders were planned and organised by Harrison," the FBI said.
“It is also clear that there has been a secret agreement between state and local law defenders who not only participated in the lynx, but also left the evidence and kept the identity of the witnesses.”
Brooks expressed himself more briefly on the whole issue.
"It was a massacre for election law," he said.
"The murders have had a clear subtext for all local black people: 'this is how you will be affected if you register and go to vote'."
Each year's reconstruction of the event at Moore's Ford Bridge organizes almost ten years of Cassandra Greene.
Its performance is imageable, puzzling and embodimentary. It shows deep-rooted racism, which many would like to regard in modern America as extinct.
Following this reconstruction is not easy and it's more difficult to turn away the sight, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about lynxing, because we have to face the unpleasant feelings that are hiding in each of us," Greene said.
"But we cannot have a relationship unless you hear what I had to go through."
The main tests of this year's reconstruction began in June and immediately on the first day about 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest of blacks - entered the room where Greene met with a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is running the position of the assistant director.
For many years he played the leader of Kukluxklan, but according to his words, the role is exhausting.
"I have a bad feeling because it resists who I am," Marbaugh said.
"I think it is very important to remind ourselves regularly of this part of history, because we never want to come back to that time."
Hercs Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm's role, the title of Barnett Hester, practice their roles.
The show begins with a tap - Malcom deals with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get out of my land n--e!"
Rascona doesn't exist.
He's on his way.
At that moment, everyone (although every black actor) will explode in laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
"What happened?" asked Rascon.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," says Greene's rejoicing.
"I just don't think the whites said "n-r" like that."
"Precisely," one of the players will run black.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is all of a sudden better; the enemy replaces the feeling of approaching.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic, just to make it enough for four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
Rascona points to the correct wording of the word to N.
No one's laughing anymore.
The performance ends violently and quickly.
Riv, shot... and found quiet.
The woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of the actors and sings the sad song of Billie Holiday's "Strang Fruit".
Each word is in the room feeling sad.
On the back of that, about a dozen viewers are tearing their way and tears out of their eyes.
There are practically the same number of blacks and whites in obedience.
One couple arrived from New York Ithaca, many of them looking at them from a nearby area.
Each of them wears a local wet climate for almost eight hours, and Brooks is in representation leading to Malcolm and Dorsey's graves.
Until now, the murder could be seen with a retreat, but now, standing in the same place where the lynx occurred, the atmosphere is terrifying.
In the final words of the song, the Green Group will call for the inspection of the bodies.
Children kneel to their victims' heads, watch false blood and imperishable bodies and whisper something in their ears.
"They're not dead," the little boy will be sure.
He'll run for a few minutes, and Greene's grateful for his obedience.
The heroes are cleaning up the wool and tearing their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the leader of Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona hugs his two friends-herself and cries in their arms; at last he's filled with emotion.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know that you have a role to play.
But you had a reason for that."
Later that same day, he's gonna sit there with the actor for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple are talking about a presentation with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski hardly found words that would express her feelings from today's performance.
“It’s difficult to listen to those bad words and look at the hideous effects... that make people who look like you and do it because they look like you,” she said to the reconstruction.
"It makes me realize that lynxing is still the current theme," she added, "only called police leaks".
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in the courtroom, enjoying dinner and talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he was already planning a performance for another year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear that we had to experience - but it is also a moment of thought," he said.
“If we don’t learn from it, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know or study the history of their country are condemned to repeat it."
I love the instructions for use.
One of my friends says that the instructions to use are read only by the smurf.
I don't agree, on the contrary.
It's one of the modern forms of art, it's often surrealism.
With nostalgia I remember a long time ago, where the instruction to use anything was rather a raritious order.
So maybe my first gramophone contained only one paper, on which were the hieroglyphics showing the involvement of some parts, there were some secret marks in all.
After years of showing up inside, I offered that letter to the shaman who wasn't afraid of scratching the back of the board.
He advised me with a sticker, which the paper with the labyrinth is suitable for.
Yes, it was the usual aid for chronic depletion of toilet paper.
He found a wired wire and made it possible for me to listen to precious vinyl pies again.
The new time has brought new directions.
And a relatively simple harvester of fruit, where he simply held over the grep, demanded about ten images.
Especially mentioned was a description of how to insert one piece into the other.
The combination was bilateral and another procedure was simply not possible.
On the contrary, it required considerable effort with the need to break certain plastic components.
My contempt for guidance ended at my self-movement of the Seat Leon brand.
The 2003 production year still had such a booklet with a reference to small corrections, which included, among other things, the exchange of flashlight lamps.
It was simple.
A total of three steps and the work should be done.
Regrettably, the author reminded us that while the lamp went right, it was really only in three steps.
One, split the cover.
2. Blow out the flashlight and pick up a new one.
3rd floor cover.
The lamp on the left had a problem with the location of the battery cover.
At first I thought that I would insert the right upper ends into the vehicle's frame of some of our handcuffs, a screw that he would cover easily and then I would drive points 1-3 of the successful author of the service book.
I don't think so.
The cover had no place, no space, no room for the slipper's hand, and the only one on the border was Slezan.
I've lost half an hour of my life, and it's all without any success.
The condition was still strengthened by my wife's entrance to the garage, which he called for a rhyme and a word that from my mouth sounds quite exceptional.
"What are you doing here?" she asked herself.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I miss the vulgar terms, there were only two publishing words left.
I'm changing the lamp.
"And why does it take you so long?" she ventured into a sentence that in a long-lasting relationship might be her last.
I slowly explained the problem to her, focusing on the torture process of the author's instruction, where the blessing of the burned iron on her hand, which she wrote, after her inclusion, was no longer a mere introduction to the wide-scale instruction of Kladiva on the witch shop, including his commissional fire on the top of the Losin castle.
"What's the way to unmount the box?"
In a clear regret, it came and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And that's the day my colleague called me, who was just in a collapsible state after two state medical offices were checked.
I know her as a well-balanced colleague who has experienced the potential and the impossible in the field and who can interpret even wild stories with an unrecorded voice.
"Present that I have received a fine for not having an elevated hand-washing guide," he told me with a weak voice.
Gradually, I solved his whole problem, which resulted in the fact that he had no image of a hand washer on the patient's toilet.
His argument to the Commission's office that adults wash their hands fairly and that there is no need for pictograms to handle the usual activity of decent people, has no fun effect and has become a little money for them.
"It's not just like that," she told him.
He understood that the simple stunning of hand-flowing liquid water is a primitive act at the level of the chromium, that a modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, carries out this ceremony in ten steps.
So you need to tell me you need to get out of the water.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end of it is a joyful finding that a person has washed his hands exactly as he is ordered by the SÜKL hudar.
Finally, I have to admit that I've let myself be inspired, and I'm preparing a detailed plan for the operation at the toilet.
In the matter of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there will be no problem, in the case of drowning, given the difference between the two sexes, it will be necessary to raise two instructions.
The problem remains those icons, because to create a perfect procedure means also the exact description of all anatomical details, which could trigger a certain deterioration in the routine visitor’s toilet, the fact that it can finally be learned that the opening of his life was completely flawed throughout his life.
Pearson leaves the next 3,000 employees and reduces dividends in an effort to revitalize the trade
On Friday, the British education group Pearson stated that it would release 3,000 other employees and reduce the temporary dividend by 72 per cent in response to another restructuring programme with a view to changing the business model.
Another wave of release, which, according to Executive Director John Fallon will arrive at the end of 2018 and from the beginning of 2019, follows the previous decision of the company to release 4,000 employees in the framework of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to reduce costs of another 300 million pounds (394 million) in May under the third programme to reduce costs in order to raise the decline in trade as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its share in the Penguin Random House of Bertelsmann, stated that this year's outlook remained unchanged after it announced a one-percent increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to 2,05 billion pounds.
Attack on a convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers were killed in a suicide explosion
A suicide assassin attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul. During the attack, one NATO soldier died and several others were injured, the officials introduced.
Five soldiers and interpreters were injured, as NATO said.
According to informal reports, three civilians died during the attack in the city period of Qarabagh.
This month, Afghanistan was hit by a bomb attack - more than 30 people were killed on Tuesday during the air raid.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In his statement, NATO stated that the Tuesday explosion had occurred after the guard was attacked with members of the Afghan army "the local person with a built-in explosive device".
The declaration further states that all injuries to soldiers are beyond the risk of life and are located in the U.S. military hospital on the base of Bagram.
According to the rapporteurs, the increasing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the area of Qarabagh is a significant source of concern for NATO's liaison forces in the near Bahram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20 % of whom died in the capital.
At the end of July, a bomb killed at least 30 people in the Shia cabin.
The Taliban signed up for the attack.
On 31 May, a major explosion in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people. This is the most deadly militant attack in the country since the US troops launched the Taliban government in 2001.
Violence is already undermining such a questionable situation in Afghanistan, and President Donald Trump is considering an increase in the number of American soldiers who should help military units and police officers in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, the suicide attacks which he has experienced in recent weeks have resulted in public confidence in the government, its regulation, and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghanín.
In response to the complaint, the EPA has reassessed its decision to remove the smoking rules
The US Environmental Protection Agency revoked its decision to postpone Obama's administrative law, which ordered States to reduce emissions, only the day after the Agency had sued 15 States.
In the middle of the night hours, EPA announced its decision on the adoption of the 2015 Ozone Standards, saying it presented the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the States.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and we will listen to their opinions," said EPA Director Scott Pruitt.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA's efforts to remove ozone standards - which measures the actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and on the basis of the measures, determine the limits that need to be met by October 2018.
The group of fifteen of the majority of democratic states, together with Washington, D.C., filed a complaint on Tuesday, arguing that the EPA is illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration seeks to prevent many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - according to Trump's words, in an effort to boost economic growth.
However, the new government's efforts have led to counter-measures by the Democrats and conservative groups that are concerned about the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA on its website states that breathing air with ozone content "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
The singer Ladislav Bubnár got his wound and blood flow!
Tohoto, with us a relatively new singer, may have already registered in June this year, when this almost unknown singer has arranged for us to the Czech conditions of the monstrosty action, which he has hosted such leading personalities as Master Karel Gott, Lucie Bíl, Simona Krain and a number of others, and the action has not been observed by anyone other than Leoš Marès.
The purpose was simple, to show the public and to present their music video to the song of Sarah, whose baptism was reproached by the very named personalities.
However, few people know that the video film itself, which took place in Russia, did not go through without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big movie with Russian national ballet stars and it didn't go away without a proper trap.
The song of Sarah is very emotional and is based on the unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the dramaticity of the scene, in the video clip, the singer's juice was to mark the impact of the face.
At one point, however, he struck him so strongly and directly into the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was the morning, I didn't expect it, and immediately my blood dropped out of my nose," Ladislav noted the situation.
Colleagues and producers said the situation on the spot was an accident and Ladislav was unable to react in time.
Unfortunately, the injury was not so serious as to influence the continuation in another film.
We're bringing the young artist's video clip to you now, and you can record the hit scene in it.
Undeclared version of blood, but it was not better used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomačenko spoke at the meeting about the possibilities of a mutual duel
Vasyl Lomačenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most recent boxing match in a light range, met at the Tuesday meeting.
Each of them was in a separate room in the ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia - an unbeatable champion in the lightweight World Boxing Council - moved down to the hall where he welcomed Lomačenka, a champion in the peerweight World Boxing Organization.
After Garcia's victory on the basis of a unanimous decision against the former four-dimensional world champion, Adrian Broner, in the Saturday match on Showtime, both boxers got on the list of five best boxers in a light range.
Garcia drew his line and said: “How's it going, champ?
Good luck."
Her title against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN is presented on Saturday at 19:00.
Boxers pose for photographers and manager Lomačenka Egis Klimis adds that the potential fight of boxers would be a "perfect test".
"I'm an ex-gambling champion," Garcia adds.
“Because of the Broner fight (67 kg), I had to take it, but I’m not that big.
I'm small on my 63 kg.
I'd like to go back to the category of light weight.
The little girl has to go back to get on her weight... and then we can fight.
That's what fans want.
Why don't they do it."
It's a break-in.
"The box would benefit from this game."
The climate required a payment for the survey - which is part of its strategy. The winner should graduate his debut in a light bond at the end of this year and next year fight with Garcio (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in the game against the duel of Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who competes on 23 September on the title of a light bond in the Forum arena.
"The attack should be carried out in the style of payment for sightseeing, that is what fans are asking," said Garcia, who later said that the possibility of sending a match through a television station is open, which will come with the best offer.
“We are the main attractions.
No one else will pay such attention to themselves.
We'll wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia stated that he recognized the Lomačenka as a "wonderful boxer" and could participate in his Saturday match.
But she didn't give Garcia the praise when she said that the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow... sorry Mike, but you're saying about knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show the strength and then the box.
Both of the boxers said they felt a growing tension in front of each other.
"You'll just not forget this game.
No other match is paying so much attention.
And I'm very happy to put you in the fire," Garcia said.
"I've been waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey."
It'll be a great match."
The young couple disappeared 12 years ago without a trace.
Their cars have now been found at the bottom of Volga.
Two young Russians Ilja Žirnov and Kira Čerkasov have been missing since December 2005.
There was widespread persecution after them, but without success.
And finally, for lack of evidence of investigation, the police have ended.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty, not knowing what happened to the couple.
After 12 years, a sad marriage of the entire story came.
The rage of their car was found on the bottom of the Volga River in the city of Čekboksary in Chuvašk.
Thanks to the documents left in the car, the police were able to identify a few.
The evidence survived the whole decade under the water, without them the police would have been long enough to find the identity of the found.
A couple were last watched when Zirnov borrowed a car from his father so he could pick up his girlfriend from work.
The sink that the car discovered is still anonymous.
He reported his findings to the Chechnya police who pulled the car out on the beach the following day.
Researchers believe that the death of a young couple was an accident caused by a narrow road leading along the river.
However, the investigation continues, further details will be published after its completion.
Latest results of testing for the age limit of asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of asylum tests in Sweden, which were detailed in the new method of their age, show that more than 80 percent of people were questioned as being 18 years old, but not all believe their accuracy.
Swedish Medical Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is to evaluate asylum applications more accurately. The measure was adopted after the Swedish Migrationsverket was criticised for failing to determine the right age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted a review of 6880 cases and the Forenz Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests carried out from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 per cent (2002) was considered to be 18 years of age, while in another 25 cases the forensic agency concluded that the question was "maybe 18 years of age".
In the next 423 cases, it was decided that the question was "maybe younger than 18 years".
Tests shall only be applied if the age of the questionnaire is controversial.
According to Johan Gøransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
"In contrast to last month, statistics are kept in busy circles and numbers are very similar," The Local reported.
A higher number of asylum-seekers, whose age was estimated to be 18 years old, do not necessarily mean that asylum-seekers lie about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that 442 cases were found that “the person concerned is 18 years old or older”.
News Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the person concerned stated that he was 18 years old.
Critics have also come across the medical method of determining age, which includes X-rays of the teeth of wisdom and MRI scans of knee joints, which are then considered by dentists and X-rays.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who, among other things, deals with the assessment of the biological maturity of the people to determine the age when the person in question went through puberty.
"I had reason to think about this issue and I do not think that these types of measures to assess age are correct.
The assessment of biological age is, in a sense, very insignificant.
If we can't determine the age with accuracy, we shouldn't pretend to be wrong," Metro reported.
The forensic agency Agency's Gâransson defended the decision: “In general, the risk of misjudged children as adults is small.
The highest risk is that the person in question is under the age of 18, which in this case corresponds to 10 per cent of all those in question."
Trump was threatening the president of Mexico on the phone.
American President Donald Trump, in a January phone call from Mexican President Enrique Peň Njet, threatened not to meet with him if he would publicly say that his country would not pay for the building of a wall between the United States and Mexico.
Trump said in the interview that funding would somehow be arranged, even though he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Similarly, Trump spoke openly to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
It comes from the rewriting of interviews that The Washington Post released on Thursday.
Trump made building a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his last election campaign.
In the first conversation with the Mexican president shortly after the appearance of Trump Peñu Neta, he was not diplomatically charged with being critical of his plan to build a wall.
He cured the South neighbor as a growing political problem and pressured the Mexican president not to say publicly that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say that press," Trump said repeatedly in a conversation on 27 January and threatened to interrupt contacts with the Mexican president if he continues to issue a positive statement.
Well, financing's gonna come up with some sort of idea, and eventually it's gonna work out.
"But if you say that Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to meet you gentlemen anymore, because it's unacceptable to me," said Trump, according to the American newspaper.
The wall then marked the most important thing we're talking about, but politics may be the most important.
The execution order for the building of the wall of Trump issued shortly after the takeover of power.
Mexico's construction and financing of the wall is down to 3200 kilometers long, and that's why relations between the two countries have been compromised.
At the end of March Trump said the project would still be paid by the United States.
Trump finally met with his Mexican opponent for the first time at the July G20 Summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on 28 January.
The boss of the White House called the conversation a joke.
To that end, it was replaced by an exchange of views on the agreement that Australia would provide asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the acceptance by the United States of persons from international facilities in the Pacific States.
Trump first considered the agreement stupid, but later he came to it.
"You can certainly say that this is not an agreement you have created, but you will have to stick to it," said Trump Turnbull.
In some passages the telephone conversation with Turnbull was almost vociferous, for example when Trump considered the good idea of Australian refusal to accept refugees arriving in the boats.
"You're worse than me," called Trump.
But I found that conversation coming up.
"I hate the reception of these people," Trump noted.
I assure you they're wrong.
That's why they're in jail now.
"There won't be great people going to work for local milkers," he said.
In the discussion, he also argued that in five years the fugitive could become an assassin from Boston.
Trump led at the end of January, about a week after coming to the White House, telephone conversations with a number of world citizens, often several during one day.
The call with Turnbull finally marked the least pleasant for the whole day.
Before he finished, he said he had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin before.
Before the crowd, they fixed the killer rany.
Her father looked after her, too.
The repair took place in the capital of Yemen Saná.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose for his sacrifice a little Rana Almatari who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Mahrabi kidnapped the girl, took her father's home, where he raped her and shook her with his bare hands.
Then he raped her, too, and then he struck her body close to the mixture.
The violent death of a little girl struck the whole country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the first row of thousands of heads, who met to be a witness to the correction.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi was sentenced under the rule of the Sharia.
The victim's father communicated his feelings to the media after correction.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I'm getting better.
It's the new day of my life.
The other members of the family were present, along with the crowd, calling out the word "while justice is alive".
The gunman in the square brought a police delivery that he was pulled out of.
The cops put him on the chest.
One of the members turned his weapon against him and fired the fire immediately.
The present mob celebrated every wound that was fired.
Mr. Almatari told the MailOnline website that justice was done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, God and the right of the Shariah won," he added.
I stood at the scene of liberation in Sana and was waiting for my daughter's killer to be corrected.
Then we and our family went to the morgue.
We took Ranina's little body and buried it in a nearby grave.
My wife Jamileh and I are grateful that justice was done.
The police were afraid that the mob gathered in the square would fall into hate madness, the killer would fall and cheat.
The correction was ordered by a court under the administration of the Shiite Huti.
Originally, however, Magrabi was sentenced to 100 wounds immediately after his arrest, but his act sparked such a rebellion that the judge decided to punish him.
Al Magrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on June 27.
The morning family knew him well.
When the police searched his house store, they found evidence that his husband was planning his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creature.
What could have been his motive?
Even the animal would be more merciful to the morning.
"Our family doesn't have enemies and the injury that carried the Ranino's body was terrible," the media said.
"The morning disappeared this afternoon, the day we reported it to the police, we told the newspapers and all of our television stations, posters with her photo hung everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the killer parents who suspected their son of a terrible crime.
The girl's mother, Jamilah, had to be hospitalized after she learned that her daughter's body had been found.
In the morning, she was out playing with other children from the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where he was.
We looked everywhere, but rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we were looking for nothing.
The Yemeni people were executed and began to gather before the police station where al-Maghrabi was held, and to demand immediate punishment.
The representative of the Ministry of Justice read the current data on the investigation records to calm them down.
The accused, according to all his actions, did not express regret.
Just before the execution of the sentence, the police read his sentence, but the convicted man only looked at his rectifier for a long time.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but on the Internet there was a lot of footage that the crowd ordered.
Governor West Virginia announced a political party change
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday evening at President Trump's meeting that he is crossing the other side.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," the Governor of Justice said.
"Today, after a long prayer and reflection, I announce to you... today as a West Virginia resident, I say that I can no longer support you from the position of a democratic governor."
The audience’s response was a source of joy.
"Tomorrow I will join the Republicans," the Court added.
"As a coach, I can tell you that it's time to jump into another match."
Trump had already promised people an important announcement at a meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia and Justice did not support the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which is the only billionaire in the country, according to Forbes magazine, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large estate from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his property is estimated at $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening, which stated: "The move by the Governor of Justice is another morning for a democratic party that makes us obstacles to our journey instead of starting to raise our country."
"For a democratic party, which has only 15 governors and has at least the legislative authorities in history, the Governor of Justice is the last drop for the so-called leader-in-chief who is eager to find a positive and unified report," President RNC Ronna McDanielov stated in his statement for CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's "direct" apology for the doping scandal
Former outstanding sportsman Sebastian Coe praised Russia for his sincere apology for the doping scandal on Thursday, but repeated that it was not the right time for Russia to return to the sports world.
Russian athlete chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said at the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which took place on the pre-night of MS in the athlete - that his country from the sport world was right and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all the athletes who thus became gold and silver medals.”
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban that entered into force in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) reported that Russia supported doping its athletes.
"I think we have witnessed very honest answers and presentations today," president IAAF Sebastian Coe told reporters.
"All the members of the Council and Congress were pleased to see Russia admit her mistake and work with all the strengths to correct and restore the proper function of the entire federation."
Coe said he was also "enjoyed", that Russia accepted the criteria for its re-introduction.
"I think that today has been very successful and we have stepped up the next step, but the Congress supports the recommendation of the crisis staff to maintain the punishment that has been imposed on Russia," Coe added.
"In the coming months, we have to do everything we can to stabilise the situation.
Our effort has always been to separate honest athletes from the uncanny," he ended his speech.
At MS in a sport that starts on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes who have complied with strict IAAF rules will compete under the neutral flag.
The head of the crisis team IAAF Rune Andersen said Monday that Russia still has to meet several criteria before it is allowed back.
Tests on the presence of drugs are still inadequate and the exclusion of trainers continues to carry out their activities, he told reporters in London after the IAAF Council was finished.
The Czech Trade State contract was awarded by Františka Savova, whose state is arriving.
The public contract by the Czech Trade pro-export agencies received the publication of the Young Front Františka Savova.
Officials gave him hundreds of points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind, however, that the Czech state had brought Savov for tax fraud and asked for his release to Czech.
The Pro-Export Agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade CzechTrade issued in April a public contract for the four-year editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
A total of 30.8 million crowns were awarded to the publisher of the Young Front of Entrepreneur Františka Savova.
However, in 2014, the Czech police accused him of tax evasion and sought to get him away.
Savov fled to the United Kingdom and Czech Republic asks for his release.
For the case, the server alerted Currently.cz.
According to the original CzechTrade criteria, the award was to be made at 60% of the price offered and the remaining 40 beauty competitions, i.e. the quality of the project.
The second criterion, however, was of great help to Savov’s company.
According to Dotyk.cz, she received a hundred points in all the partial quality criteria.
It was just as a result that it moved in front of another candidate, the publisher Vltava Lab Media VLM, who offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated 404 900 crowns a month, VLM offered 324 350 crowns.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it was obtained from assessors in all qualitative criteria of a mean assessment, a total of 62 points.
Tendru also participated in the consulting company BDO Advisory and digital agency R-Media, which belongs to the same server Aktuálno.cz under the publisher Economy.
The VLM publisher has made several objections to the outcome of the tender, considering it to be unfair and insufficiently substantiated.
Following their refusal, it was decided to attack competition with the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition of the ÚOHS.
It is believed that the Czech Trade has acted in breach of the law.
"The proposer is convinced that the tenderer has reached a decision on the selection of the supplier of a public contract based on the risk of subjective assessment, a clearly favourable participant of the Young Front, etc., at the discretion of the proposer and other suppliers," the proposal to initiate the management of the OAUS this week, which published the server Currently.
According to the Director-General and the Chair of the VLM Michala Klima, the pointing of the election commission appears as an incredible and pragmatic assessment of the Young Front project among all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Every independent observer must consider such a spectacular success of one of the competitors to be unlikely and suspicious," the Current Climate stated.
The Czech Trade has not yet expressed itself to the situation.
The Czech Trade agency essentially does not comment on public orders before their closure.
All information about the orders you have mentioned is published in the Contacter's Profile and the Public Order Journal in accordance with the law.
"After the end of the contract, a full written report will be published, however, during the duration of the contract we cannot comment on its duration," said Dotyk.cz Media Representative of the agency Štěpán Dlouhý.
The young front reacted by saying that it considered it extremely problematic that the publisher of the economy had affected the article in Aktuálno.cz to the competition where it had its own business interests.
However, that fact was set out in that Article.
In the tender, she could have helped to provide a BusinessInfo portal in the past four years.
The contract was first awarded in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade led to Martin Kuba ODS.
Františka Savova blames the police for tax evasion in connection with the excessive tax deductions of his company, which caused the Czech state to damage up to 770 million crowns.
Czech Republic has requested the United Kingdom to issue it since 2014.
According to Savova, he is the head of the movement of ANO Andrej Babish, under whose influence the Mafra publisher is affected.
The London court last year rejected Savov's appeal against extradition, but the entrepreneur refused.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since yesterday, we have not had any understanding of the acquisition of the legal power of the judgment to date," Štěpánka Zenklova, a spokesperson for the Prague City State Representative, told Aktuálno.cz.
In addition to the ownership of the Mladé front, Savov was represented by Harvey Limited, based in Cyprus, who owned a Czech Buddhist brewery Samson, and in the Cypriot company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund, purchasing dangerous assets.
He should also manage the company Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes more than three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the extraction of property from some socialist youth bond.
The motorbike went down the halls and the park, ended up in the quads.
The motorbike has paid attention to an unprecedented ride through the streets, pedestrians and park trails in Ošović.
When she began tracking him, he decided to take her to the State Hall.
"Police men with increased caution followed the city when on one of the side roads behind the Marian Laznies failed to manage and took the motorcycle into the field where he was having a accident," said police spokesman Daniel Dvořák.
Finally, he had to fly to a rescue helicopter, which transported the injured motorist to the Plenary Hospital.
After the police found that the driver had no driving licence, the registration marks on the motorcycle were cut off, his production number was broken and his own production label was removed.
It's possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is the subject of another investigation.
"In the breath test, the presence of alcohol in the driver was excluded, but the test found a positive result on the substance methamphetamine," added the police spokesman.
How financial rules for football affect Neymara's movement to Paris
Rules restricting the financing of European football clubs do not in any way violate Neymar's record transition from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any criminalization for Paris Saint-Germain will be carried out by an EUFA organisation that oversees European football teams and has the power to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious list of masters.
The Financial Fair Play Rules (FFP) which introduced the UEFA in 2011 provide that the PSG will have to prove that Neymar's infringement was not financed without significant losses.
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million in return just to buy Neymara from his contract and Neymar will claim a payment of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
It follows several financial conditions of Neymar's transition to France.
Given that the PSG team is funded by a wealthy cataract family that has enriched its energy sales, it can allow Neymara to bring so many star football families.
Clubs may lose a huge amount for the purchase of players, but on the other hand they have to demonstrate the legal resources of revenue, which enables them to cover the direct costs of trading activities related to football.
The FFP introduced Michel Platini after reaching the meeting of the Director of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that the clubs that were in the hold of the new powers were ultimately cheated and risked bankruptcy if the banks or owners refused to secure them.
In 2011, FFP's rules shifted its attention from club debt to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovic with Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and losing the horrent sums for players and building a global brand - suddenly it wasn't so beneficial.
During the current three-year trial period ending in 2018, clubs can lose up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platinum had to leave his post in 2015, his successor, Alexander Czeferin, was determined to defend the prohibition of excessive loss.
"The FFP regulation is still in force and we are deciding to strengthen it in the future," said the Associated Press Andrea Traverso last week, who is monitoring compliance with the FFP rules.
Although the PSG paid the amount for the purchase of Neymara in one-off payment, it may spread the amount for accounting purposes throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be redeployed to EUR 44,4 million each year for five years.
The first wave of the FFP's highest sanctions was struck in 2014 by PSG with Manchester City, which owns Abu Dhabi group.
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ($82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and an order for the reduction of the League of Masters to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is paying attention to teams that can try to treat financial regulators by visiting their revenues through companies associated with the club owner.
Thus, even if the Turkish company sponsors the PSG as soon as financing exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the calculation of the amount.
A similar measure was taken by UEFA in 2014 after deciding that the amount of funding provided by Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
Some of the Neymar revenue in the PSG may be reimbursed by the MS organisation committee in the football of 2022 in Qatar, according to some reports.
However, the PSG and representatives of MS 2022 in Qatar rejected the fact that Neymat should become MS ambassador in football and that such a manoeuvre would easily be discovered by UEFY actors.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to comply with the rules,
According to UEFA’s Tuesday statement, no investigation was initiated in the case of Neymara’s transfer to PSG.
The source of this report wanted to remain anonymous, since the situation with PSG is not eligible to comment, the Agency stated the Associated Press.
The latest published accounts show that the PSG closed in 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and EUR 542,4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
The PSG expects the arrival of Neymara to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and sales of clothes.
The club from the signing of the contract promises an increase of up to 30 percent.
The representatives of the Spanish league, obviously concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to detach Neymar's departure, arguing that the PSG would violate the FFP rules.
"It's a clear case of the 'financial doping' club and the state," said the president of the Ligy Javier Teba for the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of the PSG as a Turkish syndicate.
Arsenal's manager Arsen Wenger, whose club owns an American sports magnet, shares the same position of La Ligy on funding the club.
"It is the consequence of ownership that has changed the football world from the foundations in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
“As soon as the club owner becomes the owner, everything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of fair play is very difficult, because the state may have different interests in participating such players in its club."
Spartan Deputy Russian: Changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand waving fans on their feet.
Tomás Russian is going to the square.
Same scene as Sunday's fight against Bohemians.
The Spartan lager broke up against the Red Star game, invented several heads, but his associates did not turn into black.
The summer team, powered by new multimillion forces, ends after the start of the two-supply in European cupboards.
Was it hard to do anything else after the Belgrade branch?
Four shots had to be fired after the incapacitated throat, which was hard for us.
At least we didn't want to lose, raise our self-esteem, so that we should reflect on what we've been fighting for.
We had a chance.
We need to work together as a team and move our game.
Why didn't Sparta get into the fight that long?
The game is a terrible waste.
The combination of the rivals was much better than ours.
We didn't get to anything, we probably fired once in a while.
Of course, it's very little when you have to win two or three rounds.
The second half was much better, we managed to play with them in the final third.
But you have to push your rivals more often into such positions.
Is the problem a large number of changes in the structure?
Of course, it's one of the pain when there's a new manhood.
We only played three competitions and the composition is still changing.
It's about the coach finding the perfect unit that's sitting down.
Is it an encouragement to you that you've already played part of two matches after you?
They're still just parts of the game.
I don't know how my condition will develop and when I can finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that happened in Sparta?
We have to be, otherwise it's not.
It's the same as the injury.
If you don't believe, you can't come back.
Sparta has decided somehow, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came back in large numbers, but they left in despair.
What can you tell them?
There was a wonderful visit again, as well as with the Goddess.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with a better performance.
Bring in something they'll come for next.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember such visits when I was here 15 years ago.
Can a season without a cup be at least an advantage for a league?
So far we're fighting ourselves, we're complaining, so it's not such a benefit for us.
In the event of an extreme tax evasion, the entrepreneur shall stay for 10 years.
The Constitutional Court has rejected the complaint of the entrepreneur Jiří Toman, who has a considerable amount of tax to dismiss ten years in prison.
The estimated damage is 645 million crowns.
Toman claimed in his complaint that justice had violated his fundamental rights, the actual finding of the courts in Zlín and Olomouci are quite incomplete.
However, the Constitutional Judges identified the complaint as unfounded, finding the CTC from the court database.
The U.S. is not another court of appeal.
"It is not possible as a fourth instance to assess the actual or legal doubts that the general courts have allegedly allowed, if they do not represent violations of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution states.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been valid since November 2015 when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouci.
At that time, Toman was in the publishing chain in Argentina, where he was, according to the resolution, also at the time of the U.S. decision.
The penalty imposed is a legal rate at the upper limit, which according to the verdict corresponds to the damage caused.
The Supreme Court referred the case to the extreme tax ruling, which has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
Man acted in 2005 to 2008 as Chairman of World Service.
The damage of 645 million crowns occurred only in the period from January to July 2008 and the total result was over billion, according to the expert.
For procedural reasons, however, it was no longer possible to judge Tomman in full.
According to the complaint, World Servis did not include all the invoices in its tax receipts.
Instead of monthly deductions, VAT and consumer taxes in the order of at least ten million crowns paid tax in only statistics.
The World Servis and some companies with which the company was trading have a relationship with a company named Radomír Elector, which was measured by the courts for handling VAT in transactions with fuel for 13 years in prison.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court prior to the time.
Summer-to-Flight Series and Comrade Detectives play on the nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for the figures of the famous 80s; for the dirty 90s (when genius David Wain and Michael Showalter referred to the MTV comedy sketch “The State”); and of course for modern times, especially in 2001, before the stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd discussed major projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and at the same time the imagination of our modern facebook era of permanent memories.
In French, it looks like someone's breathing.
The "First Day of Camp" series worked surprisingly well - not only because of absurd humor (for example, it can be a story of the creation of a talking backbone with a green one that H. Jon Benjamin spoke of).
The authors turned away from the main funny point - the middle-aged players who are playing teenage pregnant children - and could not escape from previous events.
The continuation of "Ten Years Later" in which adults play not so much pressure on emotional balance and satire is places to sporadic, including parodys on thrillers from 90 years of age as "Ruka na colébce".
At one point the building will find on the Haraburdi Apple Powerbook, wheelchairs and "a lot of other things since 1991".
Many main lines of history are repeated.
Mr. Shawalter, the writer, has still not moved through his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still panicking.
Not to mention a crazy puzzle involving Ronald Reagan (including Mr. Showalter), which encourages George H. W. Bush (very well-contained Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of French is many stories.
It is especially fun to watch forever young Rudda with long hair alias character Matt Dillon from the film Young, whose once respected character Andy is now a paprika.
France could start the moments of random madness, as if the series "Seven Up" would come back, until it reaches what I assume will be a logical reflection: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when the entire group is finally released at the premiere of "Years to the Non-Experience".
"Comrade Detective" in Amazon also calls for another type of nostalgia: Revivalism of cold war series "Takoví normalé americané", film "Atomic Blonde: No Sorry" and even the series "GLOW", in which the icons of the eastern and western Wrestling scene meet.
The comedy of designers Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanaka in Rhyse Thomase's mode is to act as a television scene: a drama of two Bucharest policemen from Romania in the 80th century who fought for truth and atheism in the form of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - the traditional Gregor and the idealist Iosef - are Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, who were awarded the English language Channing Tatum (a successful serial producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more than that.
In some jokes you smile (like policemen watching chess on TV - parody on American football).
The series lent its voice to many well-known actors - between them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny.
The Comrade Detective, however, focuses too much on the unscrupulous propaganda drama - which includes a killer with a Reagan mask - and it also looks like it.
Six long episodes are too loose and comedy moments are not enough.
At a shorter date, a propaganda satire in Comrade Detective could work, such as in the scene when Gregor and Joseph repeatedly visit the United States Velvyslanectà, in which the two fats in the halls hang the hamburgers on a large pile.
A clear message for imaginary communist obscurity is that Western culture can turn everything into a castle and an orgy.
The thinking of Romanian creators was not wrong: we are doing as much with our own culture as with theirs.
The Russian athletes did not await the abolition of the ban on startups from the IAAF.
The IAAF International Athletic Federation at the London Congress confirmed the extension of the international ban on Russian race starters for the sake of a state-supported doping programme.
The vote in the history of the world championship, which begins on Friday, was very consistent, as expected.
For the extension of the ban, 166 delegates voted against only 21 votes.
The main reason for the refusal is the fact that Russia cannot meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as the chief of the special investigation group of the IAAF Rune Andersen observed before the congress.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of suspicious athletes have not yet been heard, and trainers still work in the country with a horrific history.
Not even the Russian Anti-Doping Agency RUSADA, which does not meet the World Anti-Doping Agency standards, is fully functional.
However, RUSADA may carry out testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"Even though progress has been made, there is still much work to be done," said President IAAF Sebastian Coe.
The Russian athletic federation was suspended in November 2015 and Russian athletes thus came along with last year's Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban on incoming MS, 19 Russians were involved, who had previously proved that they had been tested for a longer time outside the Russian anti-doping system.
At the championship, they won't be able to start in national colors and in the event of victory, they won't be able to play Russian hymns.
The Bank of England maintains a interest rate of 0,25 %
The Bank of England should, as expected, announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged following a sharp economic growth and a weakening of inflation, which has added speculation about rapid growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would continue to remain "in the background" in relation to the maintenance of the interest rate - despite the loss of family budgets.
The policy makers of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Banks of England voted six times in favour of maintaining a rate of 0.25%. The results of the vote in favour of an increase in the rate of interest supported by weak economic growth.
In its annual report on inflation, the Bank predicted growth of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that reducing family budgets would continue. The Bank expects inflation to rise by 3% in the fall.
At the same time, the Bank indicated that over the next few years it should grow as a result of Brexit's inflation and also indicated that the leases of the speech should increase more in financial markets than expected.
The members of the Committee also voted in favour of downloading part of the mammoth package, the task of which was to support the economy, which was introduced into practice a year ago as a response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, it should begin to pay the plan for future financing, which will offer cheap grants to banks, although the Bank of England has stated that, compared to the planned $115 billion, it will now offer £15 billion less.
Just prior to the decision, the bank stated: "The MPC predicts that a gross domestic product (HDP) will be stagnant from a short-term perspective with the pressure on real household income and the burden of consumption."
On the subject of the Bank's interest rate, it is necessary to "remove the notes of monetary policy" to calm inflation, which is "to a greater degree" than expected by markets.
Markets are currently predicting first growth in the third quarter of next year and further growth in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any growth will be "acceptable" and "limited".
The Bank reduced the forecast of growth for the year-to-year and next year compared to 1.9% and 1.7% of the forecast in May.
The expected growth in 2018 was 1,8 % unchanged.
After the estimates were published, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $1.31 and by 0.4 % to €1.11.
The decision to maintain the current state came after the more desperate growth buried hope for further growth - HDP stopped at 0,3 % in the second quarter compared to 0,2 % of the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0,3 % in the third quarter, although by the end of the year the bank should be slightly increased.
The latest report on inflation is an incalculable comfort for households affected by rising inflation and poor wage increases. The bank stated that the situation is even worse before growth.
The report further states that monetary policy cannot "stop" revenue reductions in the next few years, but it is expected that wages will be "enormously" at the end of the three-year forecasts.
The economy should also increase due to the high interest in British goods due to a weak book, which compensates for a lower percentage of consumer expenditure.
This decision came year after the rate was reduced to 0,025 % in August last year in response to a shocking vote on the EU referendum, which led to a decrease in the librarians.
The Bank estimates that the full unification of prices and the economy will last at least four years.
Prior to the bank's decision on the latest rates, many demanded a rise in rates with rising inflation, which further increased the pressure on households. Three political actors demanded a 0.5% increase in June.
Inflation fell back last month to 2,6 % of June 2,9 %, although the bank stated that such a change was expected and inflation should rise again during the next month.
The Bank stated that the overrun relative to 2 % of the target was "total" as a result of the weak book.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, stated: “Because of the recent drop in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market seems to be just beginning to compete for orders with a good view of the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who end up with existing contracts and repo mortgages - in the offer are options free of charge, as well as low rates that are available in the form."
NHS prescribes controversial HIV treatment in 10,000 patients
From September, patients receive access to ‘transformative’ treatment for HIV prevention on the basis of a decision by the Supreme Court on NHS funding.
The National Health Service (NSH) has announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is used before sex and lowers the risk of infection in high-risk patients up to 86%, will be offered through the health service to approximately 10,000 patients within a three-year trial period.
NSH agreed to finance the trial period after the appeal court supported the decision of the Supreme Court of last year, stating that NHS had financial resources to replace PrEP despite the declaration that the medicinal product should be financed by the local authorities.
The decision announced on Thursday was taken by NHS England from the mouth of Director General Simon Stevens as a “significant intervention”, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a “deciding moment”.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start receiving patients. Other clinics will be added in October and will be fully implemented across England until April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a pre-sex HIV medicine to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
The tests showed that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of transmission of HIV among the patients at risk.
PreEP before sex means that there is sufficient amount of specific medicines in the patient’s body to prevent infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Among the patients tested are homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people and people with HIV positive partners who are not successfully treated.
The clinics shall identify eligible participants, who shall sign agreement with the participation in the test, including men, women, transsexuals and individuals with a partner whose HIV status has not yet been controlled by the appropriate treatment.
People living and registered at GP in the United Kingdom may also apply to their local sexual health clinic and refrain from potential participation in testing.
The program will come to taxpayers at £10 million and NHS England signed this week the contract to distribute medicines after obtaining an international public contract.
The trial period is designed to collect clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its target, use and implementation to a large extent.
Simon Stevens added: ‘This important intervention should be complementary and exhausting constantly and more successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than thirty years' effort to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health."
Deborah Gold, Executive Director of NAT (National Aids Trust) said: “We are witnesses of a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is given correctly and in patients at risk, it will offer the possibility of a change in the English HIV epidemic.
NSH will offer from September patients who are exposed to high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and immediate need to reinterpret a partner, leading to improved quality of life.
We welcome this statement.'
Ian Green, Executive Director Terrence Higgins Trust said: ‘The priority number one must be the rapid deployment of tests across the country; we must ensure that it is available to each patient.
We now have a trial drug of PrEP and we are on a good path to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.'
The shadow ministry of health Sharon Hodgson said: "The beginning of the trial period PrEP is welcomed and long anticipated by the change after months of delay and withholding from the government.
Evidence indicates how transformative this medicine can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and the end of the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
The following tests will lead us to a step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that we start tests as soon as possible throughout the country and protect those who are exposed to HIV and thus, together, end the spread of HIV in society."
Life on high foot: betweenpatro and smart design changed this small apartment on the Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, exchanged a large house in Knightsbridge in 2014 for an apartment on Earls Cour.
It is located on the first floor of the smart Queen Anne terrace - and is a visual display of modern design that uses the maximum available space.
“I was living with my ex-husband in a much larger house in Knightsbridge,” Joanne said.
"I was looking for something more reasonable.
I ran into this apartment in Earls Court and had the same roof height.
I fell in love with him right away, and I was mad at him the other day."
Since then, the apartment has been in the size of 1,000 meters of complete four-metre renovations.
The one-room apartment with a complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add the storage space and interspatriate to use a high ceiling.
“I used high ceiling, big windows and a lot of lights.
Such were my requirements," she said.
For this purpose, Erfan Azadi from the design and design studio Duck & Shed was based in Notting Hill and used an almost four-metre ceiling to create a home that was not only a project but also a place to live.
Strop did not reach such heights that two gaps would come up - a challenge for architects so it was to create an interpathy that could go straight.
Erfan must have involved his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is completely complicated," he explained.
"We had to arrange both rooms so that we could walk straight.
It wasn't just to build a simple platform, but at the same time to push the steel structure so that the right height is above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two suitable rooms on its own - and at the same time to add to the drama.
In the intermarriage, there is a beautiful living room with an old copper thin frame in the design of Retrovius.
The mirror furniture in gold color, silver line and retro mirror Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
A short walk is arranged mirrored on both sides and looks so far.
The mirror leaves in the kitchen look like a window to another room.
There are storage spaces at the entrance doors, which are equipped with mirrors for the storage of appliances and glass.
The advantage of the living room, which lends the whole apartment the impression of a significantly larger space, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen if it is not used.
Convenient kitchens are nothing new.
What's unique about this solution, however, is a locker door.
"We had to solve the technical site," Erfan says about the decorated doors.
"The door is designed to weigh against the weight to avoid very easily."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne has gained another 16 meters square, second room and a better overall dissipation of the apartment.
"When it comes to this, what you're selling is the residential area - or the appreciation of your property," Erfan said.
‘The real broker shall, in principle, calculate its price on the basis of the residential area when entering the apartment.’
In this case, it was possible to increase the residential area while maintaining quality materials that promote the space of luxury views.
“Material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional peace with your home,” Erfan added.
“You don’t like the divorcing of electricity in the walls.
Yes, they're important, but your hearts don't get it."
As it turns out, quality design and the increase of the living space can change the usual apartment to exceptional work.
And just like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States is joining.
The cultural and political gap between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has declared a ban on the travel of its citizens to Tennessee and other seven states.
The State of Tennessee has paid it and issued a legal ban on the travel of its citizens to California.
Of course, it is not a ban in full terms that citizens of the United States can travel freely throughout the 50 states.
This is that California has banned state money from spending on its citizens' trips to eight other states, including Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this madness?
California is strong for LGBT and any manifestation of non-conformity with LGBT's lifestyle is considered to be discrimination.
Tennessee, however, has adopted a law on the protection of conscience, according to which psychotherapy, which has a moral problem with the treatment of patients in the LGBT community, is not obliged to provide it, but is obliged to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and the other States have again adopted laws under which religious charity organizations, which have received children from their mothers after birth for adoption, do not have the obligation to grant adoption to the same sex couples.
As a result of these laws, California has banned the financing of its citizens' travel to the eight states of the Union from its resources.
In practice, this means that California professors must not have routes to scientific symposia, for example, paid in Texas from their universities, because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions such as Tennessee with financial support from their schools.
On the way they must get either federal grants, but it is absurd for the federal government to finance the travel of citizens from State A to State B or private sponsoring.
The State of Tennessee has been patient and its parliament has adopted a law with a resolution that it does not like California's policy of high taxes, high government spending, high deficits and the tolerance of illegal immigrants, but it does not prevail in California because of that travel embargo.
He's throwing them as a kidnapping for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to any Member State of the Union which would otherwise have imposed a similar travel ban for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the fact, now comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, everything is constitutional, nothing is counter-constitutional.
States shall have the right to adopt laws protecting their conscience, and to decide what their money will go to and what they will not be allowed to do.
Second, what's wrong with a conscience?
If the tailor has a religious problem selling pigs, why not offer only cattle, sheep, poultry, and fish?
Why should he be forced to sell under the penalty even the wolves, when the hunters offering the pigs are enough?
In the state of Colorado, one baker faces an anti-discrimination complaint and a high fine because he refuses to bake a cake for a homosexual wedding.
But he also refuses to have cake for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why not punish him and leave him at his room and the appropriate cake unordered by hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust domestic policies in powers other than federal, according to their own preferences.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California too!
Fourthly, members of the LGBT communities have at times legitimately sought tolerance for their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community are governed by the rule of life and let them live, which should be guided by all reasonable people, but some activists never insist on tolerance to themselves or to others, but on extreme intolerance to others.
According to them, no one can ever show a moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with LGBT's lifestyle, and if they do so, it should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is total.
They're new enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I don't know the situation in American history when the states have done so for political issues, except in the case of one.
Even in the days of the civil rights struggle for blacks, where the North and the West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of the segregation, the states did not impose sanctions on themselves.
In this only case was the 50th century, the political cause was slavery and hid to the North War against the South.
Of course, nothing like that happens now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political gap between the blue democratic and the red republican states is deepening and the United States is developing mentally within itself.
Unauthorized agitation.
Putina's critique got a fat cut.
Russian opposition policy Alexej Navalnyj received 300 thousand rubles for violating the campaign's rules before the presidential elections, which will take place next year.
The court punished him for urging people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
In the last two months, Navalny has organised two major anti-government street protests and announced that he wants to take over the state's post in March next year.
Chief Kremlin Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but is generally expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to him in the morning and took him to court.
He was tortured because he called people for demonstrations through videos posted on the YouTube Internet portal.
Pukuta is three hundred thousand.
"After that, we cut them off from the judge's pay," he joked on the Twitter critic Kremla.
The Russian electoral commission recently concluded that Navalnyj could not participate in the presidential elections because he had previously been convicted of treason.
Navalnyj, who is considered a combatant against corruption, however, considers the judgment in question to be politically motivated.
The fines amounting to 300 thousand rubles, the appeal of 25 thousand rubles, also lodged with the two members of the Naval pre-election team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin on Thursday.
Navalnyj entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure on a fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend the Naval in the campaign as much as possible.
In February, he was sentenced to five years of parole for stealing the forest company Kirovles.
In May, the verdict confirmed the appeal court.
The judgment is so powerful that the Navalni is prevented from running under the Russian laws.
Brothers fight for an empire worth over $500 million
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the establishment of their Italian family, move to one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth over $500 million.
Former director Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis is staying in Toorak, only three rooms from his younger brother Paula, who has held a dispute about joint property and commercial property to the highest court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business in 2014, but the strict dispute was constantly cleared before the highest court.
Together with her mother Anna, her own brothers are 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first store bought a family in 1973 at Smith Street in Collingwood.
In this place, the family of Westco Jeans grew into a chain of 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the whole company sold its family in a recosting of $85 million.
Other properties and portfolio of the De Lutis family have now been purchased for money, including offices, building grounds in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one third of the company’s assets, while his father Colin, who according to Paul’s words “a significant force and dominant personality” of the De Lutis family, owns two thirds of the assets.
The court records indicate that Colin's own properties are $316 million, while Paul manages properties for $176 million.
For Paul, the problem has just become the distribution of property and financial resources.
"Colin's proposal was pronounced in my eyes in particular for his own good," Paul wrote in an adjudicatory statement at the court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts on peace, the first session of the Supreme Court took place.
Now brothers are also struggling to control the existing business - from which Paul spoke of Colin.
Colin resists that it's not true and blames Paul for miscarriage with some properties.
In his previous unmistakable statement, Colin stated that he believed in a capable solution to the conflict.
"My Italian origin dictates to me that the family is one of the most important," he wrote.
The costs of the courtroom are rising. Hundreds of pages of cross-sectional declarations, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, have been flooded by lawyers, including Allana Myerse, QC and both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her deceased husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and bottles since the 1950 ’ s and bought a farm in Brunswick in the 1970 ’ s.
They bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco "in the last year of high school, Paul was still a small, about 10-year-old boy."
Anna De Lutis stated that together with Luig, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of the property to the sons would go well.
“Lui often said he never wanted his sons to end in court,” she wrote.
Another two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the group of De Lutis family. Colin stated that Mark was compensated for 10 million dollars at his departure and 26 million dollars at Luke.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark “were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation”.
Colin has been holding back since then, despite the fact that he is an former member of the AFL club’s performance, as he stated in his 2015 autobiography, Eddie McGuire, known television personality and best friend Colina.
Fairfax Media contacted Colina and Paula de Lutisova and their lawyers on Friday.
He answered Colin only by means of a textual report stating that, in view of the fact that the dispute is settled before the court, "I have nothing to add".
"It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to settle the whole matter before the court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, in one of the statements before the Court, Colin stated that he was trying to adapt to his brother’s requirements.
"Our father would be very unhappy if he saw our current situation," he said, adding that he "still hopes in a capable solution".
On Friday, all hopes were inconceivable.
"Our disputes will resolve in the early days of the trial," Colin wrote.
Weather in Czech Republic.
Teachers are showering the kids.
MDD drivers are fashioning water and summer clothing.
At the Maternal School at Chodovci in Prague 4, where about 35 children are now arriving, they only go out in the morning.
The shell is after reconstruction and dried trees do not yet provide a large shade.
There's no pool there, but the kids are showering in the cornfield.
In the afternoon, the children are left in classes where they are exposed to jaundice and suspended curtains.
The air tries to cool clean air because they don't have air conditioning.
It's also demanding for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is in the interior and abroad, exceeds the hygiene limits for maternal schools, so during this period we should not even have an open operation," said the school director Miloslav Makovicová.
In school there's a faded corridor where the temperature moves around 40 degrees.
We'll blow up in the morning at 6:00, close the windows, and have on the south side the damage we're protecting.
"But it won't help much," she added.
They have better conditions in the forest school at Hrázi in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outside.
We have grown trees on the ground, so we're under them.
"We've got a beautiful fixture there, there's a table underneath it, and there's things we do," said the school director of Barbara Kompan.
Teachers and children are trying to go to a forest where there's a bigger guy.
The kids have wet hats and on the program have different water games.
"We have a hand-pressed questionnaire that is used for flower snacks, and we use it for showering children," Kompan said.
The director of the school in Novoborská Street at the Prague Prosecuk Jitka Vilimovská said that teachers of children are trying to keep them in the shade and the drops are water.
"We have a relatively grown garden, so they're under the trees there," she said.
It goes out in the morning and then after 15 o'clock.
Every child must have a head covering.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
For example, they can choose a little tea or a reddish juice and have a drink of water in the garden.
Every day, they also have vegetables and vegetables, always fresh fruit and vegetables, which parents sometimes bring.
"Maybe today one mother here brought about a decimal melon for children," Makovicová added.
Drivers get water or summer cot.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with hot water, ion drinks or summer cots in hot days.
Driver cabins also tram buses are mostly air-conditioned, spokesperson for DPP Aneta Реhková.
In addition to the cabin, some trams are air-conditioned in space for passengers.
Tramway high-temperature colleges have not done any serious damage.
There was a slight damage in the throat in Hostivator.
At present high temperatures, we are primarily concerned with the availability of sufficient amounts of drinks for drivers.
"The cooled drinking water is available in all the sledges, sledge points and carriages," said Řechková.
In the carriages and in some hot spots, employees have available so-called so-called sodas that produce a cooled soda.
Drivers also receive soluble ion protection drinks.
"They can also use the summer uniform, which increases the comfort of drivers during their daily shifts," the speaker added.
The hot and dry weather of the last days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, their firemen were liquidated throughout the Czech Republic by 108, i.e. double the long daily average.
On Tuesday, the day the temperatures in the Czech Republic splintered over 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters employed mainly firefighting.
"They consider fires in the natural environment and those that are connected with the work of the groom," said the speaker of the firefighters Nicole Zaoralová.
Even the night shift of the weather did not bring the fire to the fires, when the storms and the tides in a series of places were cut off.
In relation to the storms, firemen drove out to 236 attacks.
It was particularly about the removal of fallen trees and plants.
"They were no longer employed in the Central Region," Zaoralová continues.
But the help of the firemen was also needed in Svolínka in the Českolipsk, where 60 people from the child camp were evacuated because of the storm.
Tropical temperatures also assigned work to Prague rescuers.
On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they drove out the toilets to dozens of cases of oxygen poisoning with a fine.
That's why people should let their water heaters check, protect their lifeguards.
The carbonated oxide is a colourless gas without smell, which is released during incomplete combustion.
Signs of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling faint.
In the case of suspected poisoning, leave the frozen room.
Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the president's media diet
Many have tried it before and have always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
If so, it'll be the first.
The Politico Portal stated that the new Chief of Staff in the White House plans to limit the information of President Trump - including reports in television reports - in hopes that he will keep Trump on the ground.
Here is part of the report by reporter Josh Dawseye:
“When the new Chief of Staff of the White House John F. Kelly met with the new staff on the first day, he raised the key issue of Trump's White House, which he intends to correct: the wrong information that the president gets into his hands.
Kelly informed the employees that he had to approve all the information - whether in paper or word - because the President could decide better on the basis of the correct information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but a lot of his predecessors were in control of Trump and his presentation in the media broke their teeth.
Trump's relationship with the media is dating back several decades - and now that he's sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV is even stronger.
"If Trump as a candidate was disturbed by honest reports, it was appropriate to show him that in a positive light many other media are talking about him, which was easier to convince," said Politico Sam Nunberg, former campaign advisor in February.
Tara Palmeriová from the Politico portal then wrote that "the key to maintaining Trump tweets in the back - at least according to the words of six former organizers of his campaign - is to ensure that Trump regularly watches the media that sings praise to him."
Okay.
However, the idea that Trump's tendency to publish his views on Twitter was once "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something else they don't know - that Trump's tweets would be more annoying if someone didn't control them.
The tweets that Trump has never left, we'll never know.
If his employees managed to keep him at least several times in the back, then their efforts did not go unnoticed.
However, no one has ever been able to prevent Trump regularly to raise controversial issues.
Part of this problem lies in the fact that in the White House, which consists of rival factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by moving the Trumps to materials that they can, but do not have to be reliable, that support their view of the world.
The Policy Portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report in May on the intention of advisers to submit questionable information to the head of the State.
This is an example of such information from Shane Goldmacher's reporter's pen:
‘The current and former officers of Trump argue that the President is often very angry about the negative news from the media, especially the news about the lack of information, and is trying to find their origin.
The situation came at the end of February when someone emphasized to the president a copy of the GotNews.com - the website of the provocator Charles C. Johnson - who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being a "source of many leaks of information" from the White House.
Regardless of whether Johnson has always been shown on Twitter as a burden; or that he has not submitted any evidence of his claim; or that he has already made false accusations in the past and has later rejected them.
Trump read the article and started asking Walsh."
Goldmaker added that then Chief Reince Priebus staff and White House Secretary Rob Porter "were trying to implement the system for the management and documentation of information received by President Trump".
Would that work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to put forward the same strategy.
Maybe it turns out he's more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulse doesn't just go away and his assistants are still struggling for power.
These non-changeable factors of Kelly's mission certainly bother you.
Tourists discuss burial and return to “Millionary Quarter”
Several of the most mobile owners of houses in the English county of West Midland are once again set free to travel with determined tourists who negotiate with local authorities on the right to reclaim the fields for their seats.
Tourists parked 20 caravans on the field near the flourishing streets of Solihull, which is called the “millionaire quarter”.
Bringing horses, children and the army of caravans, tourists return after they were shown in May. They did not even have a burial that was dug on site under the regulations of the authorities to prevent their entry.
The tactical group found the defense spaces and penetrated the field with the caravan unprotected space that served as the route.
The strong inhabitants of the city of Solihul attacked the administrative council by ‘not being able to solve the problem’.
One of the residents who wanted to remain anonymous said: “They planted this place on Monday night after they were moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones after other people.
The Governing Council should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they're back.
Last night the next one arrived, and today they'll probably get even more."
She added that: ‘The Birmingham Board of Directors knows how to impose this problem.
I live on Streetsbrook and I don't want to keep building taxes until the board of directors has arranged with tourists."
Another of the anonymous inhabitants said, "It's funny. We've just been tracking the latest leaving tourists and now they're back.
And this time they're even more and this time they've brought horses with them."
The newspaper spokesman for Solihull’s Governing Council said: “We are aware of the unjust stay on the ground near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with the local police, we are taking the necessary legal steps to resolve the whole problem.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is necessary that as many locals as possible declare any incisive or illegal conduct by the police at number 101.
We're going to get a whole picture that we're going to take to court."
My husband hit a car in Brussels with a euro deposit.
He's been brought by a government special.
The government special delivered injured Robert Žitňanski to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and the aircraft was under constant control of the Slovenian doctors.
The long planned flight went away without any complications.
Róbert Žitňanský had a serious accident in Brussels at the beginning of the summer, according to information from TV JOJ.
I think he's been hit by a car and he's been in serious condition ever since.
After transporting to the authorities, he was transported to a specialized workplace in one of the Bratislava hospitals.

Italians join in the fight against the rescue ships of NGOs with immigrants on board
Italy announced that it would prevent the arrival of the rescue ships of NGOs that are approaching the coast of Italy with immigrants from the Mediterranean unless NGOs sign new rules governing their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they could continue in their operations," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with Turin Daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came the day after the Italian authorities had entertained the ship of the German rescue organisation Jugend Rettet for suspicion of trafficking with people, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The rescue organisation, which operates for the first year, refused to comment on the whole because of the accusation by the Italian state prosecutor Ambrogia Cartoje.
“They are for us, and there will always be a priority number one rescue of human lives. So we are very sorry that we can’t operate in rescue zones at this time,” the organisation stated in a statement on social networks.
"All current charges can only be commented upon after collecting all the information and assessing the whole situation."
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Juventa organisation Jugend Rettet since October.
Her crew is suspected of transporting immigrants directly to and from the people on board.
At least one meeting was reportedly only 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya. The meeting was published by the Italian media.
The crew of the ship is suspected of violating the law and involving the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in this area - from humanitarian excitement, more than anything else.
Code of Conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on board the ship, such as the Youth to monitor activities.
Only three out of nine non-governmental non-profit organizations that share in rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The last designated organisation stated on Thursday that the new rules are not necessary but acceptable, since they do not represent any "substantial change or obstacle" with regard to rescue operations.
For example, the adoption of a new code of conduct has also been rejected by the Association of Unlimited Doctors (MSF), which is the holder of the Nobel Prize.
In the meantime, Minniti has heard that the rapid decline of immigrants in recent weeks, which are being deployed in Italy in the context of rescue operations, indicates that efforts to strengthen surveillance at the coast of Libya and cooperation with local elders bear fruit.
"In the last days, we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He also identified plans for further negotiations that will take place this month with the old Libyans on economic development initiatives, as well as representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali, on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of achieving Europe.
Unhappily Mesaroš: She had a silicone and a cellulite out of her mouth!
The hot summer days are all about taking on the most necessary part to cover the most intimate parts.
Just Dominik Mesaroš is doing it the other way.
At an afternoon meeting in the Prague Zoo, where the actors, the moderators, the singers and all they have to do with TV Prima, just the hummingbird, hid their body in the mini-overall.
And there were only a few ordinary moves and the model showed all its silicones, but also a bump.
He took over her as many times as he had between half, and she was so high that she had to fix it all the time.
She certainly didn't have to pay attention to the ladies and the photographers.
Michelle Carter is convicted of sending text messages that are promoting suicide to Conrad Roye
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two years' imprisonment for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, a 20-year-old, is staying 15 months from a two-year sentence on the net and then spends five years on parole.
Carter was sentenced in June to the ingenious murder of Conrad Roye, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.
Roy’s father said in court on Thursday: “The whole family is crushed.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left free until the decision was made.
She was threatened by 20 years of freedom, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy were suffering from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and creamy blouses, Carter became when declaring the judgment on the spot with tears in his eyes, his hands and his eyes directed towards the ground.
"Its execution killed Conrad Roy," the plaintiff said.
"She finished her life to shed her own tears.
She couldn't accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show any benefits."
However, the legal representative of Carter said that these were "unfortunate circumstances which he was uneasy to regret."
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder does not have a significant impact on her performance”.
The complainant read Roy’s mother Lynn Roy’s statement: “Don’t run away one day so that I don’t grieve over my son’s loss.
I want him to be proud of me - I'm taking care of his sister and we're going to suffer the unbearable pain that we're going to bear with us forever," said the statement.
Roy's sister Camdin Roy testified that she "seizures" her conscience that she would never be a nonparticipating brother of marriage and would never be a aunt of his children.
"The loss of the person I've been seeing since I was born is the pain that I will bring to my life," she said.
The State of Massachusetts does not have a valid law that would force a person helping another person's suicide. This case thus establishes a legal precedent.
Carters were 17 years old when Roy was found in 2014 on the car seat, poisoned by carbon dioxide.
The case came to the attention of the entire nation after Carter's textual reports were published that led to suicide.
“I don’t care if you both jump out of the building or get out of it,” wrote the text reports that Carter sent just two weeks before his death when Roy was on family leave.
A few minutes before the suicide, she wrote to him, "You have to do this to Conrade" and "You're just gonna hit the generator and you're gonna be free and happy."
Judge Moniz stated that Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and ordered her to abstain from any comments in the press.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who stood by Carter's side was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007.
Ms Knox (30) made a statement in the Los Angeles Times: "Michel Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison."
Audi adjusts up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in response to acute response
A very early day before the announcement, the Audi car manufacturer BMW stated that it would offer its customers to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The president of BMW said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Munich, which is based on BMW - that consider the ban or restriction of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that he will adjust the three million Mercedes vehicles across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a download.
European car manufacturers have promoted a large proportion of the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to comply with the carbon emissions regulation.
However, nitrogen oxide, which releases diesel engines, is considered to be carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
At the same time, there is an increase in the cost of cars on the installation of a gas neutralisation facility for diesel engines, which facilitates the competitiveness of cars.
While German car manufacturers face careful searches, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces charges of disassembling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's errors, which in order to meet the emission limits installed in their vehicles, which reduced the quantity of emissions released during the test, but under normal conditions the software was disabled.
Several senior representatives of Volkswagen were accused in the United States and others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the engine development department in Audi would be arrested in Germany.
The former manager of Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian national and does not apply to him extradise, so he can face the trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi engaged in a criminal investigation of the German police in the Volkswagen car after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system that was supposed to cover European emission limits - and extended the charge that Audi faces in the United States.
The inclusion of the Audi car in the investigation may have an unfavourable impact on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer forms a disproportionate share of the Volkswagen profit.
The plane stopped by emergency at the beach.
The man and the girl are dead.
An accident occurred on the beach Praia de São João in the area of Costa da Caparica, approximately 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses to the SIC News TV channel said that the plane was flying straight ahead of the people who were on the beach.
Some people from the beach were supposed to flee from danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape the machine.
On the beach according to local media, a 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl died.
"The plane hit and they were dead," local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias described.
Their nationality is not known yet.
There were two people aboard the plane, both of whom got out of the accident alive, and the police took them to the polls.
D11 or not to build a highway.
And the roads in the Czech Republic are complete?
I'll give you a fight.
It's unfavorable, even though it started to build in 1978.
Even though it's unstoppable, it's constantly being fixed.
And it must not continue to be built, even if it has a building permit.
What's that?
Yes, the main road D11.
The construction of its next section for at least a few months has stopped the movement of the Earth’s children.
We walkers get the road around the corner, like they're stealing salads.
They're hiding their wallet and then they'll just see when and if we can get another one.
Then we don't want anything miraculous.
We just want a short ride and we want to get a truck driving to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
Infinite trucks flow directly through the city of Jaroměř or Nachod, which is not as reasonable as the object.
But so far the last cut of our dream road was carried out in 2008, that is, nine years before the incredible nine years ago.
Not a dick since then.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometers of unfinished section to Hradci Králové and other sections to Jaroméří began an archaeological research with the beginning of the construction at the end of this year, you could hear the voices of the punctures in the eastern Czech Republic.
No one believed it.
Last week, it turned out he wasn't going to build this year.
And maybe not next year.
The Children's Movement of the Earth Club for Sustainable Transport from Brno has given an explanation.
Children Earth repeat their D1 tactic.
They attacked decisions on building permits all over the world.
They shall request a review of all binding opinions already issued by all the relevant authorities.
For example, the mayor, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Office.
So we're going from D11 to the nearby village with an excuse name for the funeral.
So we're riding, we're just going down the street, and we're just standing on the sidewalk all of a sudden, and we're giving the opportunity to join the column.
The worst part is that you see similar stories all over the Republic.
A scary, constantly stuck road to Benešov, D1 or D8.
Everyone has their own funeral.
What are the Children of the Earth requiring?
What is the basis of the problems of the construction of communications in the Czech Republic?
And why is the road network virtually infinitive in the current system?
Read in the new reflex.
Levandule from Provence threatens climate change
Levandule has become a symbol of Provence in southeastern France, but now they are threatened by climate change.
Levanduli dies as a result of dry climate and harmful moisture, causing fear on the faces of researchers and farmers seeking solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the Provence Agricultural Research Institute CRIIPPAM, stated: “The growing of lavender in Provence is threatened because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate changes that bring less precipitation in the spring and autumn.
It affects the life of the lavender.
They also have their own cicadas and potatoes carrying micro-bacterials, which are made in the dry climate."
There's a lot in the barn.
Levandule likes tourists and the oil that is produced from them is an important ingredient of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “The place of long and beautiful flowers is growing smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants.
The quantity of oil obtained from these lavenders is, of course, smaller."
A possible solution can be more efficient distribution of water and slowing the draining of water from the ground, but also the lavender of protection mix of food and water and the breeding of several species resistant to dry weather.
The murder of journalists highlights growing threats in Mexico
Employees of the riodoc weekly meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss news about the concerns that are taking place in the area of Sinaloa for the participation of organised criminals, corrupt officials and drug-free wars.
Today, however, under recent events, he meets mainly for his own safety.
They know it's important to change their habits.
Two deserving journalists are talking about what would be safer: taking their children with them to the office where someone attacked the grenade in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the black table: opponents, neutrals and allies.
They ask journalists to give names to every word - there is no need for any evidence, just to use imagination and imagination.
Choosing them out of what - drug dealers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspected of taking money from government or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose task is to hide criminal proceedings.
Violence does not exist and the bodies are flocking across the country; journalists remain among them: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, they are at least 25 from President Enrique Pena Nieta's appearance to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven of them were killed this year in all seven states.
Among them are the co-founder of the journal Riodicace, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence that is eating with drug trafficking.
His loss is censored, although his presence is all - a large photo of Valdez with the inscription "Justice", on which the medium hangs in the opposite direction of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years old, have a shirt with a photo of Valdez with a smile on the face, glasses on the nose and the hat of Panama.
The meeting takes place not two months after his death; journalists talk about each other's traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor was set up in 2010, with the aim of dealing with journalists' cases, two suspects have so far complained to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur each year are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime.
Newspapers from Riodoc insist that they will inform about the violence that is taking place in Sinaloe; although they are destruction and the territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information about the monsters and without a sense of justice, the meeting on security is unexplained, says Ibarra.
"It is foolish to waste time on such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, nobody can be trusted."
On 15 May, Valdez left the center of Riodace in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloy.
He managed to capture several blocks when his red Toyota Corroll was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 shots, according to everything about the name of the article - which can be translated as the Twelve River.
The shooters then stepped into his car and almost hit her from the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left his wife and two grown children behind.
It seems that the news in Culiacan is spreading rapidly.
In Valdez's case, however, there's still a suspect.
Since last year's arrest of Guzman and his January edition into the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country's most bloody battles, how the rival fraction tries to fill an empty place.
Every day, several people and graves are killed in the streets of Sinaloa, full of two-footed mausoleum for drug kings, many of whom are bigger than homes.
Forget the moment that the word "appropriate" means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes that travel to the United States.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was familiar with the risks of his employment, with Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoc still deplores the fact that he did not protect his friend.
They believe that two doubts contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of talks with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that led the war with Joaquín Guzman's sons.
The peace could have angered the sons; suspicious gang members gathered all copies of the news at the time they arrived on the counter.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after entertaining the other news in which the same story was printed.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death was seen as an important milestone in the fight against Mexican criminals against journalists.
He survived for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed it would never change.
In the Noroest magazine he was practically vetted when in 2003 he decided to sell his stock at $50 and set up with five colleagues in Riodoc.
In Sinaloe, "it was impossible to operate a newspaper and not mention drug trade," Bojorquez said.
In time, Riodok received a good reputation for solid and truthful reporting; the newspapers began to do so.
Newspapers were happy to go to search for issues and published texts without censorship - the reader was fascinated by reading stories that nobody else dared to publish.
Eight years after the foundation, Riodoc won Maria Moors Cabot's prestigious award for the Latin American report.
The same year Valdez won the International Press Freedom Assessment of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for its solid report on Mexican drug trade.
Valdez openly admitted to fear.
"I was afraid of my life," he said when he accepted the prize.
Trade in drugs in Sinaloa is "the way of life," Valdez said in October last year in a talk for Rompeiento TV.
“You have to take on the role of journalists – or play stupid.
I don't want anyone to ask me, "What did you do to the face of death... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The employees of Riodoce were met after Valdez. A man was known by his jokes and incoherent language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and promises - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar opposite the office and sat at the same table.
Now they're asking: did this routine blame him for his death?
His death also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his job the best and stay alive?
"They don't like it when you're messing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret landing grounds."
"These things were forbidden," Bojorquez said.
This results in a high level of self-censorship and self-esteem.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel like there's nothing going on here, hands off.
The problem is, editor Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "which is the meaning that can be fooled... and then it came to that thing with Javier."
According to him, the old rules, like others, no longer apply in Sinaloae - as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, which are home to a toxic mix of luxurious pastures, weak governments and corrupt policies.
The country is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the room where the employees of Riodoc are meeting; a few days ago, spyware was discovered that bought governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two policemen are located in front of the 40-degree waterfront in the shadow of a nearby tree.
They were selected by the state to protect the office of Riodace, which is located in the four-storey building in the Culiacan city district.
Newspapers are afraid if these politicians don't exactly belong to them to 50 percent of the law's defenders who are, according to the government's statement of corruption.
It's been a few months since reporters last released themselves to mountain areas that basically control drug cartels.
There are three main stories on the program this week.
The first of them is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Chavez in Sinaloe.
They are also dedicated to suspicious government expenditures that have been incurred in the home city of the Governor of the State.
Recently, there have also been several kidnappings in one of the most luxurious Culiacan restaurants, a single block from the state representative's office.
No one officially announced the identity of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the abduction, so the reporters were aware when they were about to write about what each city's inhabitants know: that the restaurant is the favorite destination of drug dealers and politicians.
One of the journalists read from the public records that the restaurant was registered on behalf of a certain policy that was a member of the institutional revolutionary party (PRI), which ruled all levels of the political scene almost throughout the last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of corruption at high stations.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about the previous incidents that occurred at the restaurant, including the incident where one of the sons of Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzman escaped the military unit.
A month ago, readers would read about this topic in the Valdez section, which was the best source of information on abortions.
"Valdez would certainly dissolve the case," said Villarreal (46), who is renamed "El Flaco" for his nuanced character.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office has changed into a cedula warehouse and a label for protests against the killing of journalists. Employees certainly did not expect to become activists in press representation.
The journalist, Miriam Ramirez, came down with a number of signs and was given the next morning to demonstrate himself before the State Representative's office for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared only three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoacán.
Only a burned body was detected, and the authorities claim that the DNA analysis is about Adamea.
The activity of journalists is taking place all over the country. Many of them organize protests and march to the "SOS print" halls and buildings.
The director of the news of Bojorquez is the day of a visit to Washington, where he is trying to gain international support and achieve justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloy, who was taking place the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez has accused the authorities of monitoring journalists and their murder for declaring the truth.
In the meantime, she asked for a transfer to another department of concern that her anger might threaten her neutrality.
Valdez repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are "defeated" by organised crime, corrupt officials and the greedy public.
In his last book Narco-Journalism, he wrote that journalists die not only by the hand of drug cartels, but also by order of policies and security forces that cooperate with organised crime.
The media surveillance group Article 19 accused more than half of all attacks on police journalists and public officials.
"You die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez added.
The murders are obviously working.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, who happened six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found together with a message that allegedly signed the cartel Zetas: "This is how I ended up with my reports."
Next to her head was a keyboard and a earpiece.
Some branches decided to end the activity, such as the El Norte newspaper, located at the northern borders of the state of Chihuahua in response to the March murder of the rapporteur, Miroslavy Breach.
The others continue, as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the death of their director in 2004.
In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the public drug cartels as an article on the opening page entitled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists fled their homes or even across the border.
It's an awkward decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as it is difficult to get rid of the feeling that someone is constantly following you.
And journalists are persecuted and killed, such as in the case of Rubena Espinos, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in the apartment in Mexico City, three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who have decided to stay and not give up their jobs, there is a great risk every day.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is heading to hell, that's why I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday afternoon and the staff of Riodoc are sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking a beer when suddenly it starts calling the phone.
It is learned that 19 people died at a gunfire between gang members and police officers near the beach resort in Mazatlán.
The war is escalating, just as many of the messages left in this area by members of the syndicate were promised.
Newspapers publish this news from the mobile phone on the Riodoc website.
He won't even run one day and the opening title is changing again.
The sounds of the police sirens show up on another gunshot.
Bojorquez takes a summer look at police surveillance to see if they're paying attention.
If they're scared, they don't give up.
Under the huge portrait of the co-founder of their journal - whose mediator is an excellent slogan for the entire Sinaloe - all Riodoc employees follow his steps.
"How can we just think about leaving," said Bojorquez, "when on the same day that Javier was killed, an internnist asked me to send her to the street?"
The dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid their enemies
At first glance, it looks like a socha, no matter how scary.
Researchers have now discovered the findings of the first findings of the amazing creation of the size of the rhino, whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts called “Mona Lisa dinosaurs” - have found a Canadian mine.
The remains were kept to such a high degree that the experts were able to determine the red color of his dirty skin and stated that the dinosaur had a “problem past”.
The article in the magazine Current Biology stated that it is “the most remarkable of the ever-recognised rebound dinosaurs and one of the best species of dinosaurs in the world”.
The stoneline is a new kind of nodosauridae boiler. Dinosaurus lived in the period Kryda, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked researchers who described it as “in fact remarkable”.
According to National Geographic, the armored whitesmith is still the best preserved rock of his species.
The discovery is based on Shawn Funk, who discovered the stone on 21 March 2011 when he returned to Suncor Millenium at the bottom of Canada's Alberty.
He attacked something that looked like a foreign object and decided to examine it closer.
The stone was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working on the discovery of animals from a huge piece of land weighing 1,100 kg.
After completion of work, the dinosaur is ready to reveal.
“It’s enough to keep your eyes shut and you believe he’s asleep,” said Caleb Brown’s work leader and the naturalist of the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is exposed.
“It will certainly be recorded in history as one of the most beautiful and cherished species of dinosaurs – Mona Lisa dinosaurs.”
In his study of skin, researchers found that this former brewer - although he was covered by brinking and recalled walking tank - was most likely facing serious threats from the massive dinosaurs.
The heavy-duty dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a masking system that uses many animals today.
Experts claim that it made it possible for him to stick better with his surroundings and avoid the enemies. The masking system indicates that he was the favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
News of 110 million years of the old Nodosauridae dinosaur appeared first in the May newspaper. Currently available at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers gave him the name Borealopelt markmitcheli after Mark Mitchell's museum technique, which, along with the team, spent more than 7,000 hours searching for fossils.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of fossilism, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists could document the specimens and shape of the caves and the bristles all over the body.
They discovered a masking method that they usually use today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, finding researchers is surprising because Borealopelta's size far exceeds today's animals using the same technique.
It is possible, then, that dinosaurs were such a number of predators that evolution gave the advantage of masking before confrontation in survival.
Many modern animals with masking - such as deer, zebra, or peas - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as a prey, which means that nosodaurus had to fight for his survival literally.
"The transmission of a huge and heavy armored dinosaur illustrates the dangers posed by predators during the time of the crisis," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic ingredients contained in the strains also revealed that dinosaurs were likely to have reddish skin coloring.
Researchers continue to study animals and watch for further knowledge of their life, including the preserved contents of the stomach, to search for their final food.
They believe that after death the dinosaur fell into the river and was taken to the sea where he drowned at the bottom.
In the area of Alberta at the time, there was the same climate as in today’s Florida and rivers and oceans have moved much further into the interior than it is today.
“This nodosaurus is really remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved dirty skin and at the same time it is kept in three dimensions and so we can see its original size,” Brown said.
“For these reasons, animals look practically the same as in the time of the flocks.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; you just have a bit of an eyebrows and it looks like he's just asleep."
During the time of the crests, huge teropides passed through the earth, massaging dinosaurs, moving on two feet.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyronasaurus rég - lived several million years after Borealopelt, this armored dinosaur could have been the favorite of its just as terrible ancestors.
Among them is Acrocanthosaurus, 11.5 meters long monster with weight over 6 tons.
Researchers, whose latest findings were published in the magazine Current Biology, believe that the body of Borealopelt was discharged into the sea after it was mummified in the bath.
The discovery is based on Shawn Funk, who discovered the stone on 21 March 2011 when he returned to Suncor Millenium at the bottom of Canada's Alberty.
According to the museum, it is about the best preserved protected dinosaur in the world, including skin and bridging, which is also complete from garlic to garlic.
The animal reached an average length of 5 meters and weighed up to 1300 kg.
He had two 50 cm of bones out of his shoulder.
Researchers believe that this former brewer took the territory of Canada today, until he ended up in a river that swept him into the sea.
His underwater tomb kept the body in perfect condition.
Fossil residues of this species are also kept to the extent that the protected wages around the skull are still covering the residues of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote back to National Geographic, “finding such a hidden entity can be compared to winning in the lottery.
The longer I follow it, the more shocking the finding seems to me.
Fossil residues of this species are also kept to the extent that the protected wages around the skull are still covering the residues of the skin.
On his side lies his right front leg with his fingers pointing upward.
I can easily count the holes on his feet.'
How did one activist find out the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shot all over the body.
On the day she arrived in New York, St. Louis's mother sat on a bed in Airbnb's room and made contributions on Facebook on her phone.
She went to a high school student's contribution.
"The police just shot an 18-year-old boy whose body is still lying on the street," he said.
She was surprised that no one else wrote her this post, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The user @TheePharoh constantly retweeted her contributions to the wall.
Rapper from St. Louis posted on Twitter his contributions to the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old who was shot by a white-haired police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's body, which is lying on the street without government, from where no one even took it for four hours.
"That's crazy," she thought.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She postponed the phone to return to him the night she watched tweets about the people who gathered at Canfield Drive.
She was following a photograph of police bands and shouting people. One man claimed that he was a victim's father and hand held a note with the title "Ferguson Police killed my unarmed son"!
She was following live news - one of the police stood in front of a group of protestors, holding a guide in his hand and at his second end of the beating dog.
In another video, another police officer, as she pointed out, held a gun he was looking at and said, "I will kill you all... animals."
"It's not normal," said Ferrell.
“This is not the type of murder we have been accustomed to and we can call it normal.
I felt a bunch of skin all over the body.
"I was angry and cried."
She went back the day before, and she went home the other day.
After arriving at 23:00, she took her six-year-old daughter out of her father's office and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years describes the new document "Whose Streets?", which will appear in the movie on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protests, love and resistance, forces and insanity told from the perspective of the people living in the community who go out into the streets and demand answers.
On the way to Ferguson, the Ferrell dialogue with his daughter - dressed in flower dress and the same flower front - was launched on the theme that had already been discussed many times - "of black experience".
"Do you remember how I taught you how blacks had to fight for what they believed?" recalls the conversation.
"Now we're going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old and that's not right."
"It did not appear that I would not take her with me," Ferrell later stated.
"Today's events are the perfection... that happened in the past.
She had to know it and see it in her own eyes and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but at the same time she had to know the difference between different layers of black experience and what we had to do to get rid of ourselves.
Although I am able to provide her with conditions in which she does not live on her own skin, she does not differ in any way from another black child-wife.
I feel that if I protected her from this experience, I would only harm her."
After arriving in Ferguson, South Florida Road was the first stop to the police department, which became the basis for activists who expected the words of police officer Darren Wilson about his possible involvement in the incident.
This is where Ferrell met his daughter with a local businessman who was preparing for other food.
Together, they prepared food for the bags and helped to spread it to Protestants.
In the eyes of Ferrell, a new type of activism began to be born slowly.
"My activism turned up after 9 August," said Ferrell, adding that at the University of Missouri-St. Louis High School, she was the president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn Association and sought to introduce health care and food in the Black communities.
"I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, Ferrell was introduced to a later co-director document, Sabaah Folayan, during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farnar wanted to "document" the ongoing events.
Ferrello, however, thought, ‘Are you working on a document or are you trying to find a story that could be used?’
Such a type of skepticism has penetrated the community through many people, often white people, who want to make up for pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in the open talk: “We have heard that the voices of people who are born and raised in Ferguson are very often remembered and we wanted to change that.”
Folayan has already engaged with co-director Damon Davis, a recognized local artist who deals with the subject of prisoners in the cause of death.
His participation in the project also attracted Ferrell and the other six locals who followed the "Whose Streets" team in the years following Brown's murder.
"No one speaks for us in this document, but that's our statement," said Davis.
"This was important to me - as these people will be represented - because I will be represented in the same way."
While the purpose of the document was not to focus on the experiences of Ferrell - in an effort to show that the movement "not about the rescue leader but about the community's approach," Folayan said - it was just the most inextricably inclined to participate in the filming.
The document "Whose Streets?" describes the very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, for example, how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell with a smile on her face in thinking about the first moment when she looked at the final version of the document.
"But I understand that in order for me to do this job and policing blacks, I have to open up."
The story of Ferrell also highlights the role of the central black woman in the wider aspect of Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of movement - who created in response to the murder of the teen Trayvona Martin in 2012 on social media campaign under #BlackLivesMatter - call themselves surprises.
"Black middle women at the leading positions are ultimately behind the movement," said Ferrell, "because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black Middle Women must bear the burden of these events."
Folayan agrees with this statement and adds that "the movement is actually supported by black women and a large number of middle black women."
However, it is true that "this is not just an affirmative matter" and Ferrell is not the main hero of the document because of his opinions.
"That's exactly what she was doing with power and energy," she said.
"that it is not an accident in the front lines because life on these crosshairs in the skin of a black woman is dangerous.
You feel that energy attack in front of the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, cameras of television stations cleaned up their position, but the difficult race gap between the community and the police persists.
Ferrell has two-and-a-half-year condition for blocking the road during demonstrations.
The social political atmosphere in the area called home described as "unlawful."
Yet, it is not in its effort to commit itself to the moment that it emerged three years ago on the streets of Ferguson.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our chains."
There was a field burning in Cologne.
There were dozens of firemen out there, and a helicopter helped.
Not far from the Czech Ship in Cologne, between the towns of Bylana and Liblice, the area of about 15 hectares has been burned down since 14:00.
The fire around 15:15 stopped spreading, the firemen declared the third level of firefight out of four possible.
According to speakers, Ladislav Holomčík helped fire from the air to light a helicopter.
At 6 p.m., fire broke out, fire caused damage to 700000 crowns.
There were dozens of professional and voluntary firemen fighting on the spot.
The fire caused a technical failure in the engine compartment of the van.
Hasit also helped a helicopter who carried out a total of six bowls of water.
"In the place of intervention we have handed over to the owner until tomorrow at 8:00 a.m. to watch the unit of volunteer firemen," Holomczyk said today.
And Coming Resemblance: an artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of one of the rooms of the New York Fridman Gallery, there are immediately several faces of different shades of skin - white, black and breakfast - hung from the ceiling on the wires. Each of them looks like the previous one.
All 30 portraits were made by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from the lipsticks and hairs that Chelsea Manning sent her.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former analyst was punishing 35-year-olds for unauthorized publication of secret cableograms on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was launched on 2 August, bears the name A Coming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines his experience with technology, computer and art, and Manning, a transsexual and pro-racial dissident, whose punishment reduced Obama three days before his departure from the post of President of the United States.
An algorithmical DNA analysis by Manning and using 30 portraits to illustrate how a person with this genotype would look, created the Dewey-Hagborg Brit, unless an intellectual comment on DNA's subtlety - as well as many ways that DNA can interpret - and the unimaginable determinism of these interpretations, as well as identities.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, has been talking about being considered a woman since childhood. In 2013, she was convicted on the basis of twenty complaints, including violations of six Spanish laws, computer fraud and theft.
All her photographs were kept by the prison staff. Only one black-and-white photograph of the lower quality, on which Manning, apparently concerned, sits on the seat of the driver in the platinum blonde paruque, which is now connected.
In 2015, positive reactions to the Dewey-Hagborg project from 2012 Stranger Visions continued.
In the framework of this project, Dewey-Hagborg has used various forensic objects - such as non-smoking cigarettes and chewers - to create a picture of the possible images of these people.
And right now, she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were going to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to supplement the article with the portrait," Dewey-Hagborg explained on the occasion of opening a new exhibition.
However, visits and photography were not allowed, so they asked Chelsea if she was interested in the DNA portrait.
The artist and her captured museum were filmed over two years by correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kung, who presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea was in love and could participate in the exhibitions in person.
President Obama indeed requested the release of Manning for several days after the comical release, which was a welcome change after several years of inviolability in the Kansas military prison.
It is interesting, indeed, that the exhibition is taking place right at the time when Donald Trump is leading a war with people who are trying to publish government information and Transgenic soldiers, while trying to find new ways to encourage their tweets in areas that should be supported.
In response to the question about this special timing, Dewey-Hagborg stated that “all is happening for some reason”.
According to an artist on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls for his huge signature (the letter "i" in the name is derived from the heart) after the end of "a single group based on sex, race, sexuality and culture".
On the opposite side are the sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - hundreds of letters C, G and A recorded by the pendulum.
By listing 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the sophisticated scientific dictionary of the artist) Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least on the biological page, we are all.
"I hope that people will take it out that our genome does not depend on who we are, and that genetic data are subjective and everyone can explain them according to their own," said Dewey-Hagborg.
"DNA will tell many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last example of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page of the above graphic novel.
He shows Manning, who's embellishing the King Kong way from the United States Discipline Barracks prison with a megaphone in his hand.
"As soon as they prevent you from acting, they win," it says.
"Never be silent."
"It's a direct transcript from one of the letters," the Philadelphia artist said.
"When I think about it, it's the skin of my head."
Manning has not personally visited the exhibition - as was foretold in the comic book - but when it does, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room with its masks, its own genomic characteristics, sorted as a bunch of Protestants.
This was also for the purpose of the exhibition, including nearly 160 cm high soybeans of Maning, on which the wheat are recorded by its genetic happy group.
"In the past, they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted to make them feel a bit of a bit," Dewey-Hagborg said about the portraits.
"I wanted to point out the perception of mass movement, which takes the form of Chelsea and frees her."
Professor of the Northwest University and employee of the Oxford University for murder
In these days, international investigation is under way after professor of the Northwest University and the staff of the Oxford University, who are charged with murdering a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, has been initiated by the police.
On Monday, a arrester was issued for the murder of the first-degree man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, reports the Cook County court case.
The document states that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died of several stab wounds.
The Chicago police reported that the body of the deceased was found on 27 July.
The police were alerted to this fact by telephone. Upon arrival at the Grand Plaza Apartments, they found a victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead and detectives were investigating the case as a murder.
Lathem worked as a professor of microbiology and immunology at the North-West University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of the University for Public Relations, stated in his e-mail statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been forbidden access to the university's school premises.
"The whole issue is now being investigated by the competent authorities and the North-West University is fully cooperating with them," Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial manager at Oxford University.
Speaking universities and Somerville College stated in an e-mail statement: "We were contacted by the British police and we are ready to assist also the US police."
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were really shocked and wanted him to join the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, the head of contact with the Chicago Police Department, stated that he called on suspects to surrender to the competent authorities.
"The police have information about their place of residence and the effort to locate the suspects is escalating," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and international police are helping in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager, who was alerted to the events that were to occur in apartment No. 1008.
The police have described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it's unclear if the incident occurred on July 27th.
He added that Latham and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management issued a statement for all residents: "The police are now working to draw up a time-list and profile of victims and investigate various motives, including domestic violence."
"In the near future we will complete the WADA plan" - Vice-President of the Russian Government Mutko
The Vice-President of the Russian Government Vitaly Mutko stated that it will not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSAD).
‘At the present time, part of the criteria for the new plan has already been completed and RUSADA has already obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this, the WADA plan was updated," Mutko introduced on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA plan for the declaration of the code - which describes the criteria for the renewal of the validity of the RUSADA - which has recently been published on the organisation's website.
According to the Mutka Code, it does not contain anything that Russia should worry about.
"Everything has been notified and everything will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Wada as soon as possible," he added.
One of the above criteria, however, calls for the alleged sponsorship of Russian athletes by the government after a public announcement of the results of the WAD investigation, which was investigated by Richard McLaren.
Mutko said on the subject: “We know the investigation because our antidoping system has obviously failed.
It was adapted to all measures.
However, there were no state programmes in our country and we cannot admit to anything that never existed."
Mutkov's words confirmed Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In his interview with Russian RSport Smirnov, he acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping factors, but added: “On many occasions we stated that the report contained controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the message entirely without exception," Smirnov said.
WADA suspected RUSSAD of carrying out doping checks within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organisation authorised the planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) this June.
Following the visit of the Moscow Centre of the Organization in July, Director General WADA Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "in the right way" to renew its validity.
The police have accused three people, one of them young.
The police accused three men of setting up a middle fire of a rare wooden church in Trinc-Gutech on Frýdecko-Místecka.
One accused is young, all three are Czech nationals.
They are threatened by criminal acts of general danger for up to 15 years in prison.
Newspapers today were told by Moravian Police Director Tomáš Kužel.
He thought it was an intentional criminal act.
"It's a very fresh issue and the police are currently working on the whole issue," Kužel said.
He stated that the police would be dealing with possible arrests of the accused.
Further information according to the Director cannot be published.
"I can't tell yet, because, in fact, workers in the criminal police and investigation and state representations are working on the matter," Kužel said.
The wooden church of God’s body in Gutech dates back to the 16th century.
He was a valuable memory with many original equipment and images from the first half of the 16th century.
Major damage will go according to preliminary estimates to tens of millions of crowns, but historical loss is incalculable.
After the fires began to be considered the refurbishment of the church.
Most of the costs should cover the insurance, other costs are ready to be shared by the Ministry of Culture and the City, a public collection is also prepared and is calculated with the contribution of the owner of the memory, i.e. local fernities.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine of the 16th century in Ostrava-Harab also destroyed a fire 15 years ago.
That's when the electrical system got in trouble.
Then there was an exact copy in his place.
The state counts with the citizens in the defence of the state.
They'll support their training.
With financial support for companies to be used in the defence of the State, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of training instructors, the aim of the law on the preparation of citizens for the defence of the State is eternal.
The Ministry of Defence, which has been entrusted with the task of the government, promises to increase the physical capacity of the Czechs and their capacities, which could then be used in crisis situations.
It comes from a proposal that the Ministry has prepared.
If the law were to be passed in the future, the state would have invested in supporting the defence of hundreds of millions of crowns.
The aim of the proposal is to create an effective system, according to its authors, which would help to increase the readiness of the citizens of the Czech Republic to defend the State, despite the performance of the defence obligation and on the basis of their will.
For example, the State would financially or in a material way support the networks of amateurs, shooters or cynics and would enable them to increase their capacity.
In return, he would receive information about people who are willing, if necessary, to come to the country at the time of the crisis and about their abilities or material equipment.
Accreditation instructors could also be available to assist companies and other stakeholders in training or training.
It is also calculated by organizing words with war veterans or people who have maintained their heroism.
One of the possible options assumes that a new authority should be set up to take care of the administrative and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that participation should be voluntary and that it should take advantage of their abilities until the state of threat has been declared.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual alignment of the earlier apparent boundaries between individual types of threats," the intention is to refer to the risk of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials noted that this is why there is a need to focus on support for as many capabilities as possible, not just those of the military.
"The basic objective is to create a very broad framework that enables every citizen to respond adequately to the situation of the state or life, health and property of persons, to protect himself, if necessary, to protect others, and not to hinder the performance of the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic by wrong conduct," the aim is stated.
The adoption of the law would bring small financial claims.
According to the Ministry, they will be subject to the selected variant.
For example, the Office provides financial support for projects for the preparation of citizens for public defence up to 100 million crowns.
If an administrative and coordination centre were set up, its operation could be around 60 million crowns a year.
Other money would go to pay or to build an information system.
The proposal also assumes that the role of the National Military Commands would have to be extended, which would also involve 42 other troops.
The representatives of the Ministry have previously stated that the law should also help to resolve the disagreement of certain Czech policies with the introduction of a directive of the European Union on the holding of arms.
It would allow the shooters who will be part of the system to leave some of the weapons that the directive commands.
Startups that your companies will help to disappear with another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of the employees of her e-commerce startup, but did not find the appropriate research.
The answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even misleading.
And although she promised anonymity research, some employees expressed their distrust throughout the process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity," said Errett, owner of the company's e-commerce hair care Madison Reed, based in San Francisco, who employs 75 people.
So she asked for help outside.
New start-ups from the human resources sector are constantly on the market, helping the company to investigate the satisfaction of employees.
The creation and licensing of software for the purpose of measuring employees’ obligations enable the start-ups of the company to carry out rapid voting, target specific teams and demographic groups, further offer a simple anonymity of employees and a hot line for complaints, and in some cases also allow informants to be contacted and contacted directly by the Director.
"There are tools like Strava and Fitbit on the market that follow your health status, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Glint, based in Reedwood City.
Errett pointed out that she had been given three years’ notice of what her employees thought and how they felt.
In addition to quick research and voting of specific teams, Glint offers a company temperature map and a regular overview of groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as a list of low-rated managers - which allows users to work on repairs.
The companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to take care of the culture of the working environment - in case it becomes another Uber - who is going to be in scandals after the former employee published on his blog a contribution describing the corporate environment and the burden of employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint, a demand for research on corporate culture is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance sector can exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Starting Converter from Denver in Colorado, which helps the company in preventing and discovering inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before the Uber scandals.
Between nearly 600 Vercent customers are Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, under his wings, he also accepted Uber.
Like Glint, Converter allows companies to send custom "light" surveys, collect reliable information in real time and display heat maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inaccurate behavior.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, complaints shall be sent directly to the Board of Directors.
"The court of public opinion has strengthened regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and executive director of the Convercent launch.
If the company is convinced of the wrong conduct of its employees or of non-ethical behaviour - and if the regulators do not proceed - it can face the costly consequences resulting from the boycott of customers, the exhaustion of employees or judicial proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday Restaurant network, which employs more than 25,000 people over 500 locations, uses Converter more than a year to raise employees' awareness of corporate principles and procedures and to ensure easy contact with corporate management.
Earlier, if the employee wanted to report any problem, he had to check the phone number or e-mail to run the company, formally complain and hope in a viable solution.
Often it was a frightening and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, deputy general of Ruby Tuesday, that there was no reliable way of tracking complaints from employees.
Now that the company uses Converter, rapid detection and resolution of problems that have never occurred before to managers sitting in offices have been ensured for miles away from the actual solution of complaints - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
"This is close to a holistic, overall view of employee experience," said Vitrano, who runs a group of Ruby Tuesday looking at risk management.
"At the same time, we protect shareholders from judicial disputes by employees."
The companies stopped taking the ethics, values and participation of employees at light weight in 2002 after Arthur Andersen’s accounting company collapsed after Enron’s fall in the abuse of the ethical rights of employees, Quinlan said.
But only when "the social media has been devoted to the whole thing", companies began to realize that they cannot simply hide their bones in a box in the online world.
"Before people started using technology ethics, they relied on faith," Quinlan added.
Glint and Converter offer their software in the form of a service for which the company pays regular fees.
It is a business model and opportunity approved by the courageous capital investors who supported both startups.
Convercent chose within his February campaign from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital a total of $10 million and finally transferred the capital of $47 million.
Glint won $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and won $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are seriously surprising in view of the mutual nature of companies, culture and risk capital.
The growing number of research clearly confirms that today’s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, they are not the main advantage of high wages and interesting projects.
Employees want to assume that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company that is striving for a positive message.
"If people are happy in their work, they assume that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they strive for the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Benefits LinkedIn, who uses Converter and Glint.
Investors make profits if they are made by companies and companies if they are satisfied with their employees.
And when there is an analytical tool on the market that ensures the commitment and commitment of employees to the company, it is not surprising that there are many investors who support this effort.
According to labour culture experts, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is inconceivable if the company does not take the necessary steps.
The fact is that once the company requests a rebound from its employees, there may be major changes.
And if the change doesn't happen quickly - in the worst case at all - it can cause disappointment and disinterest to the employees.
"As soon as you ask for 4,000 opinions, you must be prepared for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, the director of the council at Kotter International, who was witnesses to many companies that relied too heavily on the same data.
“Because as soon as you don’t finish things, the employees will start asking, ‘ Did they hear me at all?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should I be interested?"
Madison Reed, who now regularly conducts a survey among employees each month, has been able to solve the problem by one day, says Errett.
After the meeting, Erretová managed to reorganise several teams within the company and to start communication training to resolve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday has a very important look at its employees and hopes that it will achieve a high level of employment in the field, which is known for its frequent abandonment in the long term.
"If you do not try to create a transparent working environment, employees will not believe you," Vitrano added.
“And once you start losing your employees, you will find customers.
And with customer withdrawal, the whole company's outlawed."
Thursday became the warmest day.
Thursday is with 38.3 degrees recorded in The Watchtower in Hodoninsk the warmest day of the year in Czech Republic.
He crossed the Tuesday, which was originally the warmest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
The employees of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute were informed of this.
On the contrary, on Thursday, there were not many thermal records.
The weather hit Moravu mainly, and it was mostly cloudy in the Czech Republic.
On Tuesday, they were overrun, or recorded for 35 of the 145 meteorological stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, the record was recorded for only nine long-term measuring stations.
The present temperature was probably the same as the previous 2013 record.
In the Lednica in Breclavsk today, 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four degrees and in the Horns in Brníńsk the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three degrees.
Both records as well as the Watch Tower came from 2013.
High temperatures have appeared today mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After the Watchtower was the largest lead in the Dyjakovici in Znojemska and Brodza nad Dyj na Břclavska, where the mercury was appropriately sprayed to 37.8 degrees, but the record did not exceed.
On the contrary, for example, in Western and North-West Czechs, the ČHMU web site has so far been the highest temperature of only about 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures there began to grow until this afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current climate in the Czech Republic will gradually decline according to the CHMMU, and more rains may occur on Sunday.
Most Moravy places will remain high temperatures on Fridays and in the south-east of Moravia on Saturdays.
We've got this mess here.
The billionaires do not have the same voice in elections as any single adult in the country.
They want to decide directly, and because not all are as bold as Andrej Babish, who wants to own a state, buys political parties.
The owner of Penty Marek is sponsoring the realist of Robjski together with other colleagues on the water Martin Burdou and Anton Frycz.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is funded by the owner of insurance and the business operator in the realities of Pavel Sehnal, who is also its president.
The convicted corrupter and the king of the Czech gambling Ivo Valent ordered the Private Party.
The political movement of Agrofert, as the Andrej Babiše project was reluctant to name the cross-country mayor Jaroslav Germany, is a chapter for himself.
Their billionaires have been caught recently by the Elders too.
It's Dalibor Grandpa, the owner of the company for the security device Jablotron.
According to his own words, he enters politics to do good.
The entrance to the old-fashioned dress, but the Pope didn't do much good.
"I never set small goals," he said at the press conference.
This means that my goal is to move the ANO, to move the Old Age in elections, 20 percent.
Leckdo's a posh.
But the grandfather's rejection is more significant.
The billionaire Dalibor Grandpa is a man of strong opinions.
Although he intends to take the votes of the voters in the Old Ages dress, he continues to support Andreje Babis.
Grandfather, in the past parliamentary elections, supported him.
"Babis is not a sharp speaker and does not rule the popular rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote before the 2013 elections.
But he certainly doesn't go into politics because he wants to improve himself.
For me, Babi's hero will stay.
He's willing to step out of his world under control and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the elders introduced her as a new force, he came back from his visit to Babish.
And he said he wanted the Elders to learn how to interact with Grandma.
Some may appreciate that Grandpa does not change his mind and stand by his dress regardless of what he wears.
Others may speculate if Granny is sending the Elders to build his flock of someone so impermeable.
Another question may be asked whether Jablotron's boss and Agrofert's boss have gone wrong in the shop and is not looking for a different way to defend their business rival.
The first Pope's public performance, but it wasn't just around Granny.
Grandpa promised to send ten million crowns to the mayor's campaign.
And if they need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, it would have been difficult for anyone to put up with a similar sentence.
The other well-recognised winner Zdeněk Bakala spent millions on all sides prior to the 2010 elections.
The political division of the security agencies of Vita Barty, TOP 09 and the citizens of the Democrats have come together to reach a total of thirty million.
It's just another time today.
The law prohibits any political party from giving more than three million.
By the time Grandpa gets into politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Maybe then he doesn't have to ask himself why our policy has such a bad reputation.
His first days in politics then he crowned the proposal for tax benefits for families with studied children.
People with high school education will come to our home about fifty thousand a month.
I'll base you on a few 20s.
A man with fifty thousand is rich in the present.
The one with the twenty poor.
In the Grand Duchy's vision, poor companies are paying taxes and rich people benefit from the functioning of a social state, whose way they are not too divided.
The rich need to help them not to be anxious about their needs.
The seniors can congratulate each other on their new acquisitions, and Babies can use their hands.
The rest of us, thanks to the Pope, can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
Then there's another question left to choose.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to keep them.
Those who are members and members of their parties or citizens and citizens of the State do not have their employees and country for their property.
And finally, those who want to live well in a rich land, not just some people.
No one wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex had to be worth 234 million.
Selling real estate is sometimes not easy.
And sometimes it won't even help him with 11 bedrooms, a beautiful view of the sea, or the fact that the real estate sells the president of the United States Donald Trump.
At the sale of Le Chateau des Palmiers villa complex, the price went down on incredible 8 million pounds.
He reported on this website Mirror.co.uk.
The brochure says, "Hello, Donald J. Trump."
Get out of place like no other.
But not even the connection of a real company with the American president was an extreme price.
Donald Trump had to reduce the price of his Caribbean home by an incredible 8 million pounds.
The original real estate price was 21.5 million pounds, the final price fell to 13 million pounds.
Even after the descent, the villa complex stands at about 76 average apartments in central Prague.
And there's nothing to be surprised about.
The charming 5 acres settlement on the Caribbean island of St. Martin has 12 fully suitable bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, reinforced and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
Part of the land is also a swimming pool and tennis court.
There are dozens of palm trees on the ground.
There's a beautiful view of the sea from the terrace.
Realistically, the price showed that connection with the president is not sufficient to attract potential buyers.
Now real estate is closer to the usual prices of real estate on the island.
Trump bought property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid about 15 million pounds.
The real estate was to buy for rent.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of St. Martin.
With a new price, it's going to be in a second place.
The real estate in the neighborhood was estimated at 13.5 million pounds.
NCAA decided to end two workouts a day.
The eleven mornings are approaching, and UCLA's American football players are playing in the side row of the new school playground.
Some of them wear clothes and reveal a slow back, unmistakable sign of the first day of the training camp.
For most of these team members, a few minutes of work is scheduled for the afternoon break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will go to rooms after a three-hour training course to study for final exams before returning to the Waterman Football Center for a meeting that will take place next morning at 6:30 p.m.
"For these boys, the next three days will be a real cat," said coach Bruins Jim Mora just before Monday was overcast on Tuesday.
By cutting out two trains in one day, the NSAA wants to postpone players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least by Friday, when final tests are completed.
That's why the first three UCLA workouts are planned at 19:15 - to get stuck in so many student diaries.
At first, in the six seasons that Mora spent on the position of coach in Westwood, the Bruins training camp starts a week before last year and the training is limited for the summer semester. Its influence also has a decision to limit the number of coaches from two to one day.
A total of eighteen training courses are planned until 20 August, starting with formal preparations for the first match against the Texas A&M team, which takes place in September.
It had to be heard that it supported the decision of the NSAA, although it added another item to the already so-called player diarrhoea.
"Three or four days are under great stress and it is very exhausting for them," said Mora.
"But no one has given up, everyone is trying. They're great.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down."
UCLA will be closed after the end of the training camp, which will not be easy in view of the clear line of surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and luxury hotel Luskin Center, which has occupied players after the installation of a protective network behind the branch.
The Bruins players should have the hotel sat down starting this week, but Mora admits that when the rooms are empty during the season, there might be a problem.
"The land will guard the security service," Mora added.
“The security is taken care of, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our trainings.
He's doing a good deal with that stuff.
The hotel will be happy to keep a safe, as well as parking lot No. 8.
Let's use the maximum of our resources.
I believe everything's gonna be okay.
It's all planned."
Facebook plans more thorough verification of facts to limit the number of false messages
Facebook will send more potentially false articles to third parties to control and display findings under the original contributions in an effort to fight the so-called "fake news", the biggest social network reported on Thursday.
The company in the statement on its website writes that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, which will send third parties to verify and potentially display the results of the survey under the original contributions.
Facebook has been identified as one of the main sources of false news, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports have influenced the last election of the President of the United States.
In Europe, political debates are under way. French voters are flooded with reports of the May presidential elections and Germany is planning ahead of the January elections to punish the social media network if it does not quickly eliminate angry contributions.
Facebook stated on Thursday in his next statement issued in Germany that it is about to run a test function to control false reports in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to displaying reports verified by third parties, people are asking for more content to be better informed and able to decide correctly what they can share,” stated on their blog Sara Su, a product manager of Facebook news.
She added that Facebook continues to test the "related articles" function and also works on other changes to reduce the number of false reports.
Graphical novel design: story of A Castle in England
The small town of Scotty Castle recently played the main role in the Squeeze music video clip and found its refuge in it also Margaret Thatcher during the 70th and 80th centuries.
However, Scotty was from his shelter at the Bewl River in the British Kent witness to 700 years of stormy history, inspired by the curious nature of Jamie Rhodes from the York County - known interest in historical documents - to create graphic novels.
"A look at the letter of a man who fascinates me 300 years after death," says Rhodes with an important face.
"When I hold a letter, I feel a personal connection."
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the lives of families who lived in the town of Scotty from the Middle Ages to the Eduardian period. Every story illustrates a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not the first Rhodes book inspired by archives: it is also the author of Dead Men's Teath and Other Stories (2014), the collection of inspired documents of the British Library - a project that was very emotional for him.
"He handed me a fingerprint on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for Jakobity," he said.
"It's his finger print!
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those times you had to burn a candle to read.
When I get to the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How I love archives!"
For someone so fascinated by old papers, support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and the possibility of staying in the castle almost four months as a dream. ("To tell the truth, I have stayed a little longer.")
Rhodes spent time examining the Victorian "new" castle, browsing archives and studying many treasures and curious, such as the head of hyenas on the wall and bottles that were buried after centuries in the tomb.
He walked through the land and examined the ruins of the old city, talked to the strange men, gardeners, and sometimes with artists who worked on illustrations to his book.
At night, he drank whiskey and wrote.
The trust story of Scotty is relatively unknown, as the National Trust organization gained access to documents until 2006 after the death of the last legacy, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the employees began to search into the archives that Rhodes described as "aristocrats of many centuries spread their hands with the words, "Know it to the undergarments."
Diniks, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps depicting property: "You may think the ground dispute is boring," said Rhodes, "but I struck one case when two families were passing over the bridge.
Leave those people!"
Some stories in the book use the castle as a reflection of the city and the intention is to go deeper into English history, including the story called The Labourer, who follows a man who leaves a newly built castle to join the English rebellion in 1381.
"I found a record of the attack on the castle in 1380, which was called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," Rhodes said.
"The English uprising actually started in this area and I thought the rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe it's kind of connected."
Other stories are closely linked to the history of the castle - for example, The Priest, who tells the story of the Jesuit priest, who hid Darrell's family seven years after the English reform.
Or The Smuggler on an 18th-century passenger named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when filling up the rock (which was discovered several years after the discovery of the shell).
Rhodes’s favorite family is Darrellov: “I was intrigued by the male generation — the men of the day were always indebted and lost money for things they could not afford.
The different generations of Darrell's family solved it by taking rich or old pancakes - I imagine it was the look of the gentlemen who had the imagination of their heads to the heirs."
With the end of the stay in the castle of four Rhodes after other adventures.
He recently returned from a two - week station in the Finnish wilderness, where he inspired his next book about Elémánmáča, which was a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that was absorbed by nature.
But for Scottney, it's a special place.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I said to myself, 'Now let me hell go back to real life.'
Washington changes the conditions for granting a green card
The media has published President Donald Trump's words on the new U.S. immigration plan, which will also change in the granting of a green card.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to fall by 50 000 per year as a result of stricter rules for the granting of temporary work visas and the limitation of family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and the President.
The bill will soon be submitted to Congress.
“This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars for taxpayers. We aim at changing the rules for issuing green tickets to the residents of other countries.
The law limits the number of immigrants and replaces the current scheme.
The new application process is a priority of English-speaking applicants who come from financial resources and demonstrate the skills that will benefit our country," Trump, quoted by the media, said.
Sexual robots are on the rise - we should be watching
Just when it seemed that 2017 could not be more bizarre, a report on the technological development of sexual robots will appear on the Internet.
Yes.
Sexual robots are really popular at the moment.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sexual robots within the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder FRR Noel Sharkey, it is necessary to take a serious look at the rise of sexual robots.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the chin, and the look of robot nails.
"People are hiding from them, but they are growing, and we need to be prepared to see them as often as possible," Sharkey told us on the occasion of the release of the report.
Modern sexual aids are changed from inflaming you to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to touch - of course is artificial intelligence that resembles human behavior.
The user can "correct" the robot to his image - from the color of the eyes and shape of the beard to the look and color of the nails.
It is very disturbing, however, that many robots have their own "personality", which would also insult Stepford's mistress.
Modern inflamed ladies developed into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set his replacement women different character drawings, including shyness.
And then here's the sex robotic woman Roxxxy Gold True Company, which is supplied with pre-programmed personalities, including "Frigid Farrah", which is characterized by a shy nature and "wild Wendy" with a "good social" character.
“Roxxy Gold’s personality is set to reflect your personality to the maximum possible extent,” says True Companion’s website.
So he likes what you like, and he likes what you like.
She's even moody, just like people.
It can be tired, loud or "in the mood".
The rise of sexual robots is alarming right away for a number of reasons - among which there is no substitute for real interlinked relationships. Concerns are more of the inferior female character traits and violent attacks - e.g. frigid (read insulting) Farrah.
True Companion on its websites compares Roxxxy to a man vibrator.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't she have a husband of Roxxxx?" it says on the page.
However, sexual robots are not just fetishes or sexual aid.
Their creation and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeper rooted in our culture - away from the ideal or sexual equality towards lust after subhuman sex with optional attraction.
Most men, of course, don't buy a robot woman and while FRR talks about their growing popularity, sexual robots are still on the edge of the public interest.
However, this territorial interest can be seen as a mirror of the present modern era.
And most people aren't weird or violent until they've got a free market.
It is not a coincidence that these sophisticated sexual robots appear at a time when women throughout the world are gaining their rights and sitting in the White House is the president, who speaks at the woman's address often very embarrassing.
The most frightening aspect of the series The story of the service is not what we see - the rounded bodies and the sharped eyes, as the reality of these visions.
The book presentation The story of the servant represents a step in the right direction, but at the present time it seems to be a little bit.
Sexual robots are allowed to look as much as possible for real women (although with porno-eating levels).
Their makers build them so that they are nice to touch and act on the first look as a real woman.
However, when it comes to their "personality", a robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no work or history, nothing that would boost their independence or disrupt their devotion to their master.
In other words, they're pleasant slaves.
According to the 21st century: official.
The NBA star on the green duck.
Curry's fighting in California for a cut.
The star basketball player Stephen Curry did not lose out in spite of the packed first fire at the opening of the premiere among the professional golfers.
The double rating holder for the most vulnerable NBA player played the Ellie Mae Classic lower series Web.com Tour in California's Hayward first round for 74 races and will fight for a cut.
The Golden State player, who won the second title team at the NBA during this season, began very nervously and his first waste ended in a drink holder in a golf cart parked at fairway.
Even after that, he was not as precise as under basketball basketball, yet behind him, with the balance sheet, he left a dozen professionals.
"It wasn't the perfect way to start, I had to call the judge immediately after the first fire, but then I sat down a little," said Curry, saying that he had a huge three.
It was very nervous, to fire the first wound on the tournament, but it was all I hoped for.
"If you told me I'd play 74 in the first round, I'd read it right away," he added.
If Currym is able to fight with a shoe that is likely to be two wounds under the pair, he will become the first representative of another sport that he can do on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play the next better and now that I've rid myself of the trees, maybe it will go," said the enthusiastic golfer, who has already played in the tournaments of celebrities and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
In Hayward, it starts first on a tournament that falls under the PGA.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic, he won a sponsorship and maintained an amateur status.
Web.com Tour series is about one category under the elite PGA Tour.
The trumpet's big victory?
That's what Mitt Romney's doing with a healthy mind.
The trumpo era is the unmistakable sign of political strife that divides American voters, and in micro-scale, the whole family is also breaking up.
During Christmas and Thanksgiving, it was the advice in American newspapers to consult relatives who choose Trump.
Guess we're just waiting for the nerves to let us.
However, less attention is devoted to Trump's ability to stifle the family.
I'm talking about it because this week my cousin visited me in New York, a poet and left fan, who lives in Chicago and who, in our family, paid for the Republican stupidity for a long time.
She reminded me that the subtlety of the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, there is all at once a family - including all the Republican relatives who have been having a history of politics for many years - on one wave.
At dinner at the family table, it's a good thing; but I'm impressed that in a broader context, it poses a significant risk.
Trump is strengthening the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all away.
If we are talking about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the frightening possibility that his crafts may one day lose their appeal.
There is, however, an even more horrendous long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the regular Republicans, who, contrary to its standards, will be surprised by what can be called rational.
In these days with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of crazy conversation - a dog on the roof of the car, 14% of income tax (although we were aware of his tax admission) - both of which seem to be compared to Trump as a very small revenue.
After Trump's departure, the next Republican candidate will be at least normal, which will be an immeasurable improvement.
We used my sister's visits and took the kids to Central Park on the biggest wheel that operates the New York Park Department - for your three dollars you won't find a better use if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the middle warrior is covered with glamorous - clowns and animals are moving and in danger of their own shoulders - a completely cloudy view and zinc music of the shopping industry reminds the public.
A lot of clichés will soon come to mind: the view of the tall buildings, the panoramic view, the place to breathe the atmosphere and the reality of the city will not be given to your imagination.
About fifty years later, I still did not realize that Swiss Cottage is not actually Swiss cheese - it does not count on the thematic host Ye Old Swiss Cottage - but the London metro station.
However, the tour of Central Park calls for remarkable magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds, like two mature women, have a great time at it.
If I could evaluate the wheel, I'd deserve the maximum points, but no one's lucky.
This week, I experienced a similar experience in the store when I was asked to assess my "injection" on a scale from one to five on a payment credit card.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street, it's the same thing, with the difference that I can make a 15 percent assessment for something I'm going to buy for the counter.
Not only does it slow down the fast sale otherwise, but the waiter is forced to dive into the kindly buyers when it is not necessary.
The woman in the store smiled at me when I was reluctant to evaluate my credit card transfer with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius had to be transferred to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cutting wounds on his wrists, which, according to the sentence of the prison, caused himself to fall into a cell.
The Pistorius was convicted of murder after the appeal against the original sentence for murder.
He killed his friend Steinkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day in 2013 with several gunshot wounds through the toilet cabinet door in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed to have confused her with a thief.
The complainants announced their intention of revoking the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which they say is too minor.
The National Prosecuting Authority has stated that it is referring to the South African Supreme Court and that the trial will take place again this year.
In the event of success, Pistorius is threatened by the extension of the sentence to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, she gave birth to a young man in her embrace, who had been caught in a wild place.
It's a huge success for the rescue program.
The Centre is trying to expand the Genofon Pand kept in custody.
Čang Č-chung's center employee told the agency of New China that the herd of the panda is at great risk from the relative crossing.
Only 471 p.m. were included at the end of last year.
Only two thousand of them survive in the wild.
Trying to keep the pandas trapped with those savages is such a first step in protecting this species.
Fifteen-year-old Cchao-cchao was released to the natural reservation at the beginning of the pandi's paring period on 11 March.
Thanks to the monitoring device on the neck, the scientists could observe every step of it.
She met her elected Chao-choo 12 days later.
The sexual contact with the male was a minute and a half and it was successful.
And it can be considered a small miracle, because the pandas are not considered to be the most successful love of animal kingdom.
Males are relatively poorly estimate the time when the female is ready, and they are often confused and unaware of what to do.
The baby was born healthy and, given that Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after birth.
The average weight of the newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in the territory of Greece for illegal camping, the statement quoted bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, was detained by the Sithonian police on 1 August in the early hours.
All of them were released that same day, but the investigation continued.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated for bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have stepped up the rules of free camping and impose strict sanctions on anyone who is caught in a place where the camping is not allowed.
Controls will take place throughout the season.
The Ministry has stated that the court may impose fines.
Spilk is the first round of British Open in the 50th place.
Golfist Klara Spilk appears after the first round of major British Open in the 50th place.
The playground in the Scottish Kingsbarns hung the score one hit under the pair when she played three Birdies and twice Godey.
A 20-year-old Czech player has the hope that a famous major will be the first to walk through the corner.
An entry to the competition with a $3.25 million grant came out of the best American star Michelle Wieov, who won the first round in the record of the 64 slot, i.e. eight under the pair.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are downloading millions of toxic eggs from the market.
As a result of the incident, the Netherlands alone has temporarily closed 180 poultry.
The Netherlands Food Safety Authority, according to the Reuters Agency, announced that it is investigating 20 per cent of all Dutch poultry species, which it considers 80 per cent of eggs on the market are non-compulsory.
The Authority stressed that the risk represents only a limited number of eggs which can be identified by specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substances in eggs is small and does not pose a risk for adults, but the potential threat is for children.
The Czech SVS spoke Petr Majer said that eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities also joined in closing cattle, had not recently moved to the Czech Republic.
However, veterinarians will take samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, on which the problem signs of insecticide have appeared on the markets.
The eggs from Belgium were last in April and the eggs from the Netherlands last in May, according to the veterinary administration in the Czech market.
The chicken meat from Belgium was last found in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of preparations against biles, all and clichés.
However, it must not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The WHO World Health Organization considers it to be a bit toxic.
His high doses lead to feelings of nausea and vomiting.
Riga is beautiful, I'm going to miss her, she's called the Golman Sedláček and she's looking for an engagement.
I'd like to catch ten more years.
"Maybe I'll come back there once," said a 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in an evil dress.
Depends on whether a commitment is made before the start of the new year.
What were the four years you've lived in Lotysch?
If I had to evaluate it as in school, like in three.
The first year I didn't catch much, I had an experienced golman in front of me.
I've learned.
The second year I started to catch.
I thought they'd give me more space before the third season.
But they brought the new golman I was fighting again.
Last year, I assumed I'd still be caught.
But during the initial ten matches, we got only five points, so the coaches started to do it.
At the end of the day, my colleague was caught more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play him next season.
What was life in Rize?
Beautiful.
It's a little Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss it.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, we'll get married next year.
So I brought something.
How demanding is KHL for the barber?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are men like us or Slovan who have to change their game style against them.
Skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more back, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem in the field.
The difference is that the Russians want to play empty.
They shoot less, and even though they have a half-empty white front, they prefer to record.
There's only more shooting in the Czech Republic.
Didn't you have a problem traveling and moving over seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is mostly done so you need to play four games outside and then you have two days off.
How do Lotys take their club in KHL?
Like a national team.
The whole Lotysko is watching hockey, with basketball it's national sport.
Fans all of them.
Even though it didn't happen, a lot of people walked.
Did Dinam's action in KHL help to see that Lotyshko at the world's championship this year is almost at the quarter end?
KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And from the same time, their results on the world's championship began to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they fell in the quarter final with Canada exactly 1:2.
That was an inconvenient result for them.
Thanks to KHL they got to a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech extraligy.
Roberts Bukarts passed through the Zlín and Ralphs Freibergs signed the contract.
How come there's so many of them coming here?
They're not any beech players, they're really good.
These teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Lottys among them.
It's a natural direction.
KHL is starting in three weeks.
Why are you still unengaged?
At the beginning of February, I knew I wouldn't go on in Rize.
We started looking for something by the fall.
She was on Sparta's desk.
But because they didn't have a golman budget, we didn't make a deal.
Then it was classic.
We were dealing with different teams that decided in the finals for someone else.
So I'm training at home in the Forest and I'm gonna wait for something to happen.
Aren't you nervous?
That was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what it would be like.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I'm at home for a while.
I picked up something in KHL, so I'm already taking it differently.
The question only sounds when and where to sign.
How real is the variant that you're going to have a new anniversary in Zlín?
The state can do anything.
We'll see what's going to happen in a month.
Now I can just wait for what the agent's gonna do.
Do you prefer any competition?
The late season wasn't that I could choose.
So I'm waiting on the phone.
The government's taking the flight to Let's keep going.
In January of this year, I wrote about a camp in Letech near Orlík in article S of the care of the proper economy.
The basis of the problem remains the same, and I will allow the difficult passage of the article to be mentioned.
He's been talking about a camp in Lettech for years.
For readers who don't know exactly what's going on, it's probably best if they look at the official cultural sites of the Pietní a Leta.
There, in the introduction of a historical survey, it is found that the camp stood two kilometers east of the village of Féta, that it served as a labor camp since 8.8. 1940, that it was a collection camp from 1.1. 1942, and that it became a ciccan camp from 2.8. 1942.
The next text describes the life course of the camp, including the Dutch conditions, until March 1943, when the first annual prisoners were assigned to the light transport.
On 4.5.1943, 370 people were transported to the main transport camp.
There were 420 of them.
A very sad story of the incalculable suffering of human beings that caused them to be once again human beings and repudiated ideologies.
There is no dispute about the need to keep these events in mind.
There is no question that this reminder should be played at the memorial site of the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
After socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten, and in the 1970 ’ s, it was built in the vicinity of the former camp and in the part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was discovered in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, a memorial was discovered in Letech in 1995.
In the mid - 1990 ’ s, the government promised to buy and sell the spring, but it hasn't happened so far.
In 1998 the monument was declared a cultural memory and since 2009 its administration is under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the United Nations Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close on Friday.
So closely the facts of the camp's military verdict.
When in the autumn the government approved the purchase of the spring and decided to draw up a search warrant to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy out the spring.
According to Herman's Minister of Culture, "some numbers exist, but I'd probably dream of going public with them."
We'll see what the expert review will bring.
According to some unofficial estimates, hundreds of millions can be lost, others say the price can be up to billions.
So it won't be a cheap matter in any case.
And yet only a few hundred metres from the former camp is a monument to which the state has invested nearly ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the whole transaction was beautifully funded by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is probably not a threat, it would be, in my opinion, the same amount of money.
Does the government have any other priorities?
The memorial, a worthy place of pilgrimage, is the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the past tragedy and anyone who wishes can present the memories of the victims and the murdered.
I don't see any reason to change this!
Let's just keep it the way it is, and let's keep the fifth place with maximum care.
The person responsible should, in this case, deal with the care of the proper economic operator for the property entrusted to him or her by the Government of the Czech Republic.
At least with someone like your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Vice-President of the Government are not the whole government.
But I still see from the foregoing facts the password of the leader of the UN movement only as an empty pre-election proclamation.
This year, in May, I took a direct look at the place.
Very decent arrival route, adjusted parking spaces, replicas of wooden camp bars.
In one exhibition, in the second integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheatre with the possibility of sitting and with a view to its own pedestal, which is created from stones placed in a small bond.
Lots of flowers and vineyards.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place, as appropriate and appropriate.
Archaeological research is currently being carried out at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether it would be possible, for example, for part of the discovered bases to be observable and at least visually accessible in an appropriate manner.
In this way, the Minister of Culture, Daniel Herman, could exert his efforts.
In the event that he succeeds in the government in launching a ransom for government money, it will only be another unfortunate step in his already rather problematic action as a minister of culture.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate may mitigate symptoms of inflammation of the intestines (IBD)
For your eating system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
However, the new study points to the right opposite: food rich in animal protein and dairy products could help to remove symptoms of inflammation of the intestines.
Untreated disease, which affects up to 1.3 million U.S. residents and 300,000 patients in the United Kingdom, causes stomach and blood transfusions, weight loss, and extreme vomiting.
Patients are usually reminded not to use meat and milk products to mitigate symptoms. Researchers at Washington University found, however, that the essential amino acid triptophan contained in the protein helps to create immune cells that support the resistance of the intestines.
Dr. Marco Colonna's study explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the removal of harmful microbes from food.
The number of activated cells is balanced by the number of cells that support tolerances and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissue.
As soon as the bag turns to the side of the inflammation, it may result in inflammation of the intestines.
During the research, scientists have detected the presence of immune cells supporting body tolerances in the mouse stomach with specific bacteria.
This bacteria requires the presence of tryptophan cells - one of the building blocks of proteins.
Professor Colonna said: “We found a link between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a common part of the stomach microbial and the development of cells that support body tolerances.
The more triptophans had mice in their diet, the more these immune cells had."
At the same time, he suggested that if it is shown that the same applies to humans, the combination of L. reuterium bacteria and triptophan-rich foods would help to develop a more susceptible and less active atmosphere in the fall.
The postgraduate researcher Dr. Luis Cervantes-Barraganwas in a study of some type of immune cells supporting body tolerances found that one group of mice had these cells, while the other group of mice of the same species of kept cells lost.
It led to one group of mice having different gastrointestinal microbes - a community of bacteria, viruses and lungs that usually reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mouse was tested using the DNA method, and researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells that lost the second group of mice.
The mouse, which were kept in the sterile environment and were missing from the stomach microbes, did not develop this type of immune cells - was given to the L. reuterium bacteria - and created immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers grew L. Reuters in liquid and then transferred a small amount of fluid - without bacteria - to unexploded immune cells that were stored in isolation.
Immune cells developed into tolerant cells.
After removal of the active substance from the liquid, it was shown that it was a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-octaic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the nutshell, the number of these cells increased by 50 percent. After the split dose of tryptophan, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuter bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the adjacent products of tryptophan from L. Reuters cause the development of cells in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in the genes related to tryptophan were detected in humans with inflammation of the intestines.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Each of us should probably try to develop these cells because they control the activity of the internal surface of the intestines.
A potentially high level of tryptophan in the presence of L. Reuters can increase the cell population."
José Mourinho regards the signing of a contract with Nemija Matić and his transition to Manchester United as "genial"
Manchester United won his team "genia" in the form of Nemnja Matić - at least that's what José Mourin thought after the hostage debuted in the mid-term fight against Sampdoria.
The mother, who signed the 40 million-libre contract, entered into the first match of 2:1 in Dublin - the last pre-season match before UEFA Superpohar, where United met on Tuesday with Real Madrid - and acted in her role as a hostage on the side of Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not participate in the team's pre-season Asian tour, Matić did not have the form and played only 45 minutes, according to Mourinha's words, to work before the next season of the Premier League began.
"It takes time, but it is experienced, intelligent and has a brilliant mind - thinking football," said Maurin.
"We'll help him get into his condition as soon as possible."
Just like Matić, his new associates Victor Lindelöf and Romel Lukak also played the first match at Aviva Stadium and Maurin's start slowly to form their unit for the next season.
The independent source announced this week that Maurin still wants to sign the contract with the other three players, but insists that the club has carried out "fantastic work" and brought into the team three of the four most important players.
"Thanks to the club for helping me get three of the four players," he added.
"Four of the four would please me more, but I admit that they did the maximum for me."
The life challenge of the king of chicken skin Lady Hrushka.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
This multi-society image began to emerge thanks to a new series on TV Prima Zdeňkova Academy.
The storm immediately blew up the chance.
"Dear Zdeňka, I would like to apply to this in your cooking academy, because, hand to heart, I think I can learn a lot from you," he called him in a video on the social network.
And because they've been spying on you for several years, he hasn't forgotten the Master's honor this time.
"On the contrary, I can teach you sweaty from diet chicken meat, U.S. fries or invite you to water and show you why it's a favorite roasted cheese," Hruška said.
His participation in Pohlreich's new show is really serious.
It's time to move up and learn from the master.
"The question is, what's the boss's point," said Blesk.
Pohlreich, however, did not express himself because he filmed new parts of his next series Yes, boss!
Only Prima reacted to the participation of Hrušky at the Culinary Academy by taking the whole issue as his personal activity that goes beyond television.
In December 2004, Hruška Pohlreich founded her first cook.
She was sold over 300 thousand pieces in a few days!
The new show, which Prima presented yesterday at the press conference on the autumn broadcast schedule, is an unfavorable cooking school.
Pohlreich selects his pupils from a series of viewers, and in 12 parts he is familiar with 12 cooking techniques.
In the last part of his show Now the boss cooks in November 2014 Zdeněk on the back of his shirt let the overcrowded torch.
If my face were there, I'd be a lot of fun.
"Now I'm just laughing at that pussy -- pus is a healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," Ladja responded.
They think about the Lady's cooking art.
"Reading according to Lady Hrushky doesn't come into consideration at home, because I'm not leaving a gastropunk at home," he says.
Pohlreich's boobs are very important, even according to him, I'm making chicken for honey.
In my order, but his recipes will certainly not appear," Hruška refused.
He's an asshole!
He's not a cook for me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomic illiteracy or the devil," said Pohlreich about Hruška in one lecture.
"It's not twenty for me to be able to shake hands on them, but I can't handle them anymore," said Hruška.
The British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to take off the car and home with a hangover
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip pointing to the body. With a simple hand-cuffing can unlock the door from the house and office and even start the car.
Thirty-year-old Steven Northham has let a small chip implant between thumb and index and currently offers the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology.
Dr. Geoff Watson, anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, oversees the implementation and maintenance of medical procedures.
Technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers a service for the exchange of doors and cars compatible with a microchip. The price of one lock is £300.
A married father of one child has allowed technology to integrate into his home and his car the BMW Z4 brand, which starts with a simple shaking of his hand.
White House Recruitment became taxpayers of thousands of dollars
The White House's decision to fly with the marine helicopter on South Lawn to the occasion of the American manufacturing industry's celebration, which took place last month, came according to the shipping records issued by the TIME Week for $24,000.
The green white helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also called Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the top of the program from 17 July in the White House, which was a review of American design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and several senior officials of the White House have reviewed the review of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter from Connecticut was displayed next to the Maine yachts, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a spectacular lift from Mississippi.
The military officer of the White House issued a fragmentary order or FRAGO and requested the presence of a helicopter not more than 36 hours before the arrival of a helicopter on the South Lawn in the context of an "extraordinary" event, reported the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - units responsible for the control of the helicopter.
“I wanted to make sure you were aware of such a significant event,” said Commander HMX-1 in an e-mail to his supervisor, the commander of the Air Force for the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter will arrive at South Lawn on 17 July at approximately 7:00 a.m. to the occasion of the inspection, the start of which is scheduled at 15:00 and will remain in place until the complete clearance of the entire site planned between 18:00 and 21:00.
In the e-mail, it was further stated that, if a delay arises when departure from the White House, a replacement crew will be sent for return flights under the Working Time Regulation.
The original crew stayed on the scene that evening with the helicopter and with them also a safety unit.
Of the records - which the TIME week had received - it was not clear if the second crew had finally been sent.
The Hatch Act prohibits state officials from using government property for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible violations of this Regulation.
"We wondered if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was all right," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you're being blocked," said the deputy commander.
This review of "Made in America" was marked by the White House as an official event and the Hatch Act would therefore not apply to it.
But even official events have political sub-texts.
In his participation in the event, the president promoted a health reform that passed through the Senate and spoke of the effort to maintain the trust of the government regulation.
The use of aviation means such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is a difficult new phenomenon.
The presidents use them when travelling.
However, their presence is unusual for presentation reasons.
Trump ordered control in February after the President's plane went in the background during his first meeting in the Melbourne campaign in Florida. His Twitter account is charged with complaints about the use of his predecessor's presidential aircraft.
"The White House is pleased with the ‘Made in America’ review, which presented products from all 50 states producing American materials," said the representative of the press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in Washington and South Lawn and practice possible opportunities with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump attended the G-20 Group Summit in early July, HMX-1 performed 58 exercises at the White House.
The summer of the review of Made and America was part of the current crew training, the state factor stated.
On the same day, the helicopter unit flew into the "non-presidential support missions" for another eleven hours.
The White House pointed out that no further reservations had been made from taxpayers' money.
Sikorsky spokesperson stated that the company was not interested in any way in the discussions on the exhibition of a helicopter on South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep records of the budget for the presidential years and the exact cost of the survey is difficult to determine, according to the statement of the Navy.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hourly price for fiscal year 2017, DoD's reimbursement for VH-3D $24,380 per year.
Unit records indicate 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of helicopters are significantly below that amount.
"The introduction of the costs of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for reimbursement of expenditure is very misleading," Walters said to the whole thing.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in annual costs."
According to the 2015 RAND study, DoD's reimbursements do not include staff costs, but include fuel, maintenance and contractual costs.
The then White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter for inspection purposes.
"The idea of a review that is going to take place this week is to introduce products produced in the USA," Spicer said.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and Connecticut state are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to our state’s defence and that they provide jobs for hundreds, unless thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, we're proud of helicopters and other military equipment, whose production is divided by a number of American citizens.
This fact is to be recalled."
It's not clear if Trump was also looking at a helicopter during his march on South Lawn.
Back in the White House Trump addressed the representative of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"Sikorsky knows very well," said the president, "only his own three."
A young woman tied up in the bay at Macha's lake, the police boarded her.
The girl went out to the beach on Sunday about the second hour of the morning.
Instead of buying, she was trapped in the wetlands.
When she decided to request a cell phone for police help, she had the last 12 percent of her battery.
"That's why policemen soon lost contact with her," said police spokesman Ivan Baláková.
The place she described was a few police guards, but finding a young woman was not easy at all.
"Some of the policemen had to frown with racosal wetlands hundreds of meters before they felt under their feet a solid ground again," Balákova approached.
And similar to that, she was mistaken.
The police were in line with what led to her call for help.
"In order not to come up with this connection at least, they agreed with her that she would count out loud," the speaker said.
Police found a woman up to three quarters to five in the bays in the town of Borny.
She was on the edge of physical and mental strength and showed signs of undermining.
That's why she was transferred to a hospital in Czechoslovakia.
The Pope's Association with Stan?
The bride's request becomes a sales girl.
That's a little irony.
In his web project, I'm looking for an audience.cz as a billionaire of volunteers basically said that STAN is suffering from a shortage of decent people.
He also stated that the political party does not have a party more well-known and independent, in fact there is no national programme for the film elections.
Her election candidate will only become a decent person after consultation with the Pope, regardless of his political opinion.
That's how Vet Bart started, and it didn't work out very well.
In addition to his reputation for decent people and personalities, which may also be replaced by some elders, which he also admitted by Gazdík, Grandpa also argues that the most popular argument of the chief stan is that the greatest value of movement is just political verification and experience of seniority, traditionally the most popular policy and according to research.
You are now quietly exposing the quickly collected unknown personalities.
The total break with the people, after which Stan changed the logo and slogan, the Gazdík also explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates of the people.
But if the STAN of identity had suspected only a few of them then, after the arrival of the Pope, only the game for identity ends.
Not only did the Gazdík stand out against the ANO Andreje Babis, on the first common printer, but Grandpa, who publicly praised him, stated: "My goal is to make the ANO move, so that the Old Age movement will receive 20 per cent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he didn't make a move.
Grandpa is a successful businessman and a billionaire is certainly not an accident.
He often talks about politics like Babish, unlike him, but he doesn't build his own political brand.
Stan's been remembering more reality show than the real political side, and Dad's helpful hand as if she were doing more than a sales girl since the bride's request.
For some time, Stan went with TOP 09, then with people, and now he's looking for decent people to change.
Let's hope someone gets back to us.
Police dogs trained in the Bridge by a helicopter
Dogs specializing in search of explosives and hunting dogs practiced at the lake Bridge by helicopter.
The police dog must not be cowardly and afraid of flying, said the leading police cynics of the Östeck region Petr Tomášek.
The training of a police dog takes about two years.
At the Bridge, there were practicers of adult dog training, as well as those who are just passing through the course.
In addition to the standard training, in which they were to detect sharp samples of explosives around the lake and to search for a lost figure, all 12 animals had to enter the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
So that as soon as the helicopter arrives, he can go to work the dog so he doesn't have a problem with the helicopter.
"The old helicopter, the dog goes and is looking for it," Tomášek said.
A dog who is uncomfortable or is unable to start working right away is expelled from training.
"Most of them then leave them in the garden, for example," Tomášek added.
Police have 76 dogs with various specialties in the Uztec region.
There are German sheep, but there are Belgian sheep.
He's got a pendant word on him.
"He's raising him himself, preparing him for the service that a dog will do for us," Tomášek added.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations which may reveal any medical handicrafts.
If the dog is healthy and fearless, the first test will take 20 months.
"To a sharp stroke it gets around two and a half to three years," Tomášek added.
The length of service at the police depends on the dog's health status.
Most of them serve for up to eight to ten years.
Then they experience most of their poems.
Trailer at the 3rd Narcos season: Pablo Escobar is out of the game and Cali Cartel becomes the Wednesday of the Netflix hit series
Despite the conclusion of the second Narcos season, when Pablo Escobar's killer was discovered, Netflix's series does not end far.
Confirmation by the streaming service has already reached the third and fourth seasons - the first one has already reached the first trailer and the foundation of other opposition positions.
In the third season, DEA focuses on the richest drug cartel in the world: Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four influential farmers, they operate “as a company from Fortune 500’s label, with only the difference that they scale violent acts and pay more government factors.
Gilberto Rodriguez Oreuela (Damian Alcazar) is the head of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Oreuela (Francisco Denis) plays brain operations, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of connecting with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is in charge of New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a verbatim American and Colombian rights defender in the fight against drugs.
Among the other actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
The third Narcos season will celebrate its premiere on 1 September.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
Elections may be credible only if all members of the company, including women, have been included in the UN representative in Afghanistan.
Nicholas Haysom, the leader of the United Nations Mission of Assistance, said that the election to local representatives is involving hundreds of women, three women are taking care of the post of vice president and more than 30 per cent of newly registered volunteers are women.
"The role of women cannot be overlooked," he stated in his mid-term statement.
Elections may be fully representative and confidential only if women are involved, as well as all related processes associated with the elections.
The local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are held on 5 April.
The Taliban has issued several threats to the electoral process, which moves the international fighting activity on the other hand.
In the elections this year, for the first time, one democratically elected government transmits its very peaceful successor government.
Haysom stated that a strong role of women will strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission has stated that a total of 3.6 million registered volunteers make up 1.2 million women.
The unique beer cooks beer again.
For a good beer to a rebuffed beer.
The inspiration and sincerity of the new owners returned a few years ago to the life of a beer in Lobči near Mšena.
Bivovar, mentioned for the first time in 1586, has a renaissance core and in the 19th century was converted into a parascopy operation.
She followed years of flowering when the beer was pronounced mainly by dark beer.
Unfortunately, the production was stopped during World War II and a brewer was born in 1984.
Since then, the buildings have served the state ship.
The deaths were carried out by brewers after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and broken into building materials.
In 2007, however, new hopes came in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Paul Prouzov.
These buildings began to repair with maximum respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
Carefully dedicated and dedicated to the study of archival materials, they try to preserve original materials and building elements.
Bivovar has the same image as in the 19th century, when its golden era began.
Their work has been assessed by declaring a brewery as a cultural memory by the Ministry of Culture and the building has also become part of the European industrial heritage tracks.
In 2015, the tradition of cooking beer was celebrated.
If you want to enjoy a great lobby beer in the picturesque Kokořinska region, visit the brewery area.
In cooking beer, they use coconut water, which is found in protected rural areas, sugar from the Lobecian fields, and javelin clouds.
You enjoy a traditional light bed in the outhouse, but also dark beer and specialties.
And don't miss a brewer's tour, it's on Saturday and Sunday, on the afternoon and in the second half.
The largest crossword puzzle in Czechoslovakia?
One of the greatest strengths of his type in the whole world?
Such a unique building should have been the fortress of Stachelberg between Trutnov and Jacler, at the top of the ground cemetery above the village of Babi.
Initially, it was to be made up of twelve bunkers connected with extensive underground.
There should be a department, wife, ammunition, materials, electricity, machinery and hospitals.
But the exhibition ended the Munich Agreement.
In a few years it was possible to build the only possible iron concrete bunker and the subterranean spaces were broken.
Thanks to the fans from Spolka Stachelberg, who began to rebuild a unique building in the early 1990s, you can also look here.
The subterranean has already been made available by 75%!
The part of the area is in addition to the T-S 73 plywood with the exhibition and the underground and armed object of the light bonding, two further arranged plywood plywoods, burials and the scientific path of the Vowed Trutnovsko.
Exercising, adorable aprons and beautiful views of the countryside are guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building was listed next to such monuments as the Great Chinese Wall, Traian's port at Rome or the Assyrian Palace in Nineveh and Nimruda.
Kláster Chotéšov, originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today, above all, forms a powerful four-class building of a convention over a beautiful garden.
The list he got on, but unfortunately it belongs to unique buildings that threatens the gap.
But the fans don't want to give up, and they're running a lot of action to support the monastery.
One of them is another year's dinner for the Chotěš's monastery this Saturday of July, where Ms. Vladimir Mishik, Ivan Hlas, will show you the sheer performance and look at the places of beautiful extended buildings that are usually not available.
But most of all, you enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.

How's Moravskoslejska taste?
The seventh anniversary of the famous gastrofestival How Moravskoslejsko tastes is held on Saturday 5 August 2017 in the area of Karla Studánka mountain spa.
The chef Miroslav Kalina, tastes culinary specialties and regional food, enjoy music and dance performances, a rich program for children such as creative workshops, theatre, jumping castle, Small competition travel and, of course, a number of competitions.
Know the plant by one click.
Students with herbs and ordinary lovers of plants will help new, free Pl@ntNet applications.
If they are interested in which plant they just found on the walk, these applications will be able to help them.
The only thing they have to do is photograph the plant and the application itself recognizes what kind of it is.
The new app, which is available for iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the Centre for Ethics and Environmental Education in the Bratislava Mountain Park under the project The City's Secret Life.
The project also involved students from 50 Czech and Slovenian schools, who with teachers in the application database photographed and added plants from their own environment.
Newly created French app is free to download on the pages Secret City Life.
The main objective of the French programmers was to make the most of the people contribute to the application of their images, thus increasing the number of plants that the application can recognise.
"Children who hold a tablet or cell phone in their hands can go out into the woods," said the coordinator of this project Ivan Poláčová.
Based on sufficient quality photo of the flower, leaf or fruit of the plant, the application can identify its name in a few seconds, which will then be placed under the photograph in Czech and Slovenian.
The French allowed us to translate the secret life of the city into Slovene and Czech.
It is therefore welcome for users to contribute to a plant image that is not yet available in the database after setting up an application.
"France will assess whether it is beneficial and then add it to the database," Poláčová said.
GMB supplies regarding investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The Committees require assurance from the managers of the McVitie's dry cleaner about the long-term obligation of production in the factory in Glasgow.
The Scottish Association of GMB stated that the company is currently silent about any investment in the Tollcross factory.
More than 500 employees are working in the factory, who manufacture other products and dryers, Hobnob and Rich Tea.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, stated that over the past few years she invested more than 5 million pounds in the whole area.
She added that the staff and representatives of the committees would be "between the first informed" in the case of changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the construction company, the Scottish GMB Committees expressed their concern that McVitie's "will not be given its promises to finance and modernise production lines."
The main organizer of GMB Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we have not received a clear response from the building manager regarding the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
There have been generations of families working here, and employees come from the local community and the region of Glasgow, where work in this factory represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social exclusion.
In terms of work, wages and benefits - and despite Brexit's view, rising life costs and slow production - needs the eastern part of Glasgow's desperate prospering producer, such as McVitie's."
Pladis spokesperson said: “Tollcross received a letter from the GMB only yesterday and the company issued a statement as soon as possible, because we value our continuing commitment to staff and committee representatives.
Regular meetings with GMB staff and representatives in Tollcross were held two months ago and many problems were openly discussed at this meeting.
We spoke to the employees that, as in all companies operating under extremely competitive and non-existent economic conditions, we will assess our operation on a regular basis, which applies to all of our operations, so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested 5 million pounds in Tollcross, especially in production lines and improved operations.
We greatly appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and the localities and, in the case of any changes in the operation, the workers and representatives of the committees will be informed without delay."
She warned the PSG Barcelon about Neymara's move three years ago?
La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won't allow Neymara to get on his side after she made $189 million, which means the amount needed to buy Neymara from the contract, but warned this French team of Barcelona about its record trip three years ago?
This sensational transition has developed the waters of summer transitions. Club League 1 is ready to exceed more than twice the previous record amount for Paul Pogby to Manchester United, who paid $89 million for it last season.
After confirming and finalizing the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and at the same time the best paid professional sportsman in the world - after tax will be collected from the PSG team over £500 000 per week.
Barcelona is cursed by the way Neimar got out of his contract, despite the fact that the trusted source confirmed that the club has always tried to tell Neimar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
However, was the football world alerted to this reality three years ago by President PSG?
When Manchester City in 2014 expressed its interest in Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all clubs that would be interested in converting one of the best PSG players.
"I'm not afraid because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we'll definitely talk to one of their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they'll face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed the mind line when in summer she expressed an interest in PSG's successor, Marc Verratti.
PSG made it clear in the sense that under no circumstances would allow the departure of an Italian representative. Therefore, it is possible that Barcelona, for its trophies dealing with the departure of Neymara, now swallows the bitter pill.
Who's gonna explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have a broad understanding of the rules?
Donald Trump was on anti-Russia sanctions.
On the day before, the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Madura.
And the day before, Trump wrote that China is not doing anything to the North Korean threat and that it won't go on.
And from that, it clears the idea of a penalty like a shoe straw.
These things can't be thrown into a loop.
Madurova Venezuela really went on a trip to dictatorship, but totally.
China doesn't just act like the American president wants it.
Russia's a chapter for itself.
But if anyone wanted to take it all together so that even a normal will, American, European or other, could understand what it contains and what system of rules is based on sanctions policy, it would be almost impossible.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump is only concerned with what President Obama has already found, just giving him an implementing stamp.
So why such a fuss?
Last year, Europe was afraid that if we win the American Trump elections, we would join Putin and cancel sanctions.
That's a terrible idea.
But it's the other way around.
Trump and I don't think sanctions are being released, but they're getting worse.
But Europe is even more afraid.
German Prime Minister Zypres says Trump's sanctions violate international law.
It's like the basket is just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then there are no basketball or anti-Russia sanctions in the EU.
The head of the European Commission, Juncker, again complains that Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
It's like they're supposed to use sanctions just so weak that they don't put anyone at risk?
The common fan of tape.
For three years, he heard that the verdict of anti-Russia sanctions depended only on the implementation of the mining agreements on the Middle East in Ukraine.
It is now known that it is the EU's energy security.
He likes tape and spreads.
Russians are being punished for being too fit into a place they don't have.
China's lost to the fact that it's getting a little high.
The Venezuelan president is punished for building a dictatorship in his country's borders.
All the punishments or just considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see the system, the rules or the rules?
Andrej Babish: I don't consider working with Okamura.
Andrej Babish married, crosses the Republic with his visionary book and finalizes the election program.
In addition to the Pardubic region, all candidates are ready.
According to his words, he did not have a significant involvement in them.
He even agreed to lead the Morevskoslesk heitman and shadow school minister ANO Ivo Vondrak.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a MP or a hero," Babish confirmed his earlier opinion.
A lot of representatives and national politicians have upset your opinion that the direct election of mayors and mayors should run the locals and cities themselves, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we choose the President directly, and I am convinced that we should also choose mayors and prime ministers.
In my book, I don't talk about destroying representatives, they can be there.
The question is how many of them will be.
When presenting your book, what do I dream of, when I happen to sleep, I heard in my own ears that you were talking about cancelling the representations.
I don't remember that.
I was talking about the direct choice and the reduction of the number of representatives.
New York with nine million inhabitants has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the plumber is estimated to be building little and not preparing big projects, but she has no competence for it.
The same applies to the government that only two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
Which I'm not saying they did well.
The current prime minister is not in charge, he's just slowing down the debate.
It can't work.
That's why you want to set up the majority system?
It would be perfect, but it's hard to get through.
In the program, we only have a change in the uniform election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a clumsy mandate of ministers and the amendment of the Rules of Procedure to prevent the unnecessary display of Members who are to work mainly in committees and committees, not to be held at the meetings of the House.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are worried about.
That, as a dictator, you will drive the government, control the camera with 101 MPs, destroy both the Senate and through grateful care and primacy you will control the entire country.
I'm sure it's not.
There is nothing wrong with discussing the number of Members.
The French President Macron announced a reduction in a third-party legislature, while there are 57 thousand French lawyers there, while we have 17 thousand Czechs.
However, Macrona does not blame anyone for the threat of democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic won most elections, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making dramatic changes.
The virtues for those who have a majority are great, but only to look at Poland or Hungary.
Nothing like that in the case of the U.N. movement.
We just need a team that will work in the government for people, not for their parties or resorts.
I don't understand why we couldn't agree that only teachers, cultural workers and social services would increase.
Why have I been renamed and added 21 percent of the members of the GIBS who are now taking 60 thousand?
Would you like to be the prime minister?
The prime minister has to intervene when ministers behave inconveniently, messing with the government with travel offices, and for the state's money, they would like to business as Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and the country in Africa.
Ministers in the government don't argue, they're supposed to argue outside.
There's no room for a coalition break, a strong vote and a whisper, there's a decision to make.
How do you want to have a coherent team when the ministers are acting mainly side by side?
There's a constitutional law over there.
When the bread was baked, Sobotka said that the coalition contract was not paid, and he expelled Grandma from the government.
Any prime minister can do that.
However, if it is personality and has management skills, a similar guest plan is not needed.
They measure all the same and require perfect performance from all of them.
Do you know who you'd suggest to the Minister of Finance?
I don't even think about it, because we're not even in that government, nobody wants to work with us, even though I don't know what I've done so awfully.
There's not so much creature in place.
The elders have received the businessmen of the Pope who would like to cooperate with you, and the people may win the wing of your lean Jiří Chunk.
I don't think so.
ČSSD leads Lubomír Zaorálek, which does not exclude the U.N. Coalition, may be placed in the ODS Václav Klaus ml., which will not object.
I'd leave it on the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice-President ANO Richard Brabec said you have a lot of common points with SPD Tommy Okamura, for example in the area of the economy.
So the ocamourists are considered a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec claims he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, running as a VV Vita Barty ball, then getting money from Usvita for his company, he ran a certain course there.
Of course, he's an outstanding personality.
Of course, he's a little nervous.
When I take his program, there is a wide involvement of people in the management of society, directly democracy, that can be agreed upon.
I'm not asking you at all.
I wonder if you are the acceptable person who has xenophobic opinions, spoken on demonstrations with drums and wants to get out of the EU?
We don't consider working with Mr. Okamura, I can't imagine.
It's obvious he went to politics to benefit from it.
And what about the silent support of the communists of your minority government?
I can't even imagine it, but the voters will decide.
It's about negotiating a victory with another in line, but God knows who's gonna be a winner and who's two.
Of course, it is important for them to be able to agree on a coalition government programme.
Let's go back to your effort to be a firm.
But the government just has to drive, Prime Minister Sobotka has let everything go, never decided.
Coalitions such as ČEB or EGAP did not work.
For Sobotka's his ball, and I think that's also why he threw me out.
Once he did, the Czech government was in control of the Czech government.
It is incredible that the Prime Minister has brought a resolution written by the management of the ČEZ, which will hold the Minister of Finance to vote on the ČEZ.
If you become a prime minister, will you change personal circumstances in the Supervisory Board and exchange top management ČEZ?
Jesus Christ, if I'm a prime minister, he'll see you.
I'm not him yet.
It seems that the ČEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
Good cooperation with ČSSD would like to exchange for even better with the UN.
Well, maybe after the election, everything goes on again.
I don't know anything about it.
I don't have a Lobby of the Humble or Pink, I'm a single unit, and I don't even solve this.
Then answer directly.
If you stand in front of the government, will you try to exchange ČEZ, Czech TV or General Health Insurance, that is the institutions you criticise?
I would like CEZ to be a transparent company.
He's been doing what he wanted for years, and I've been providing for the traditional political parties.
It's enough to look into Mr Schwarzenberg's judgments.
Although he's supposed to be in the Czech majority, he never drove him, he was only there to count, which is wrong.
It's a trivial matter for me.
ČEZ is to take Dukovany, assess them, spend them in a subsidiary company, arrange financing, make a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The idea that the state should finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
What about Czech TV?
Some of her shows against me lead a permanent target campaign, but I don't and I won't have any jurisdiction to dismiss anyone.
But to control yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay for public advertising and television fees of about 7.2 billion a year, but they don't really know how these institutions operate.
How come they don't know?
However, the House approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the position of Directors-General of the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic.
Look at how those reports are being discussed, the super powerful package of Sobotka Kalausek, which has always worked.
It pays both for the current parliamentary commission to escape from the investigation records and for lex Babish.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he let Calousk push me out of the government, which saved the top 09 percent, but the ČSSD put them on.
They are afraid of violating their corrupt system, and thus speak of the threat of Granny democracy.
Nobody's immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how the First Vice-President of the UN Jaroslav Faltýnek builds a power base by completing the son of the Supervisory Board of Teplaren Brno and setting up a joint lawyer, Floroslav Hlina, a contract with city and state companies such as the Prague Transport Company or the Czech Railways?
We have a permanent dispute.
I don't like it, and I read it to him several times.
The faltínek argues that the lawyer in question works at a significantly lower rate and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As a finance minister, I didn't have anyone.
We, unlike the devils, never had a corrupt affair, no Pelt, no short-term, Brezin.
If there was any sign of clienteleism in our house, we just fired such a person.
I'm not compromised in this way.
If anything like this happens, we get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it is.
