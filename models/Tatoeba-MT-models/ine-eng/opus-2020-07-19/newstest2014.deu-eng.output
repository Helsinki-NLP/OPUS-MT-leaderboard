Good: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters apart: On Tuesday, the new B 33-foot walker was launched in Gutach at the village park - in view of the older town hall.
Two systems are similar: intention or signage?
This question was clearly answered by Gutach's mayor yesterday.
"The Council House was installed at that time because it secured the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser amp ensures both bikers and bus passengers and the Bergle inhabitants.
The plant officially operated yesterday is important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, Kurpark, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ›Grub€.
"In the case of high traffic and pedestrians, another lamp had to be brought to their safety," says Eckert.
Peter Arnold of the Offenburg Landratsamt.
"There are about 12,000 vehicles in the municipality of Gutach, about 10 percent of which carry heavy loads, according to current measurements at B 33 daily," says Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another lamp is more than necessary: "Security is just ahead," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows were carried out, also a circuit was considered, however, because of the narrowness in the cross section Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
According to Arnold, when choosing the spot of the amplers, everything was tested: "We have tested whether these vehicles can run from the Sulzbach road to the B 33 without turning the amplers into the means of an extra for us.
The approximately 15 000 Euro expensive ampling plant itself is the "modernest thing that exists on the market at the moment," Arnold explained.
The installation is equipped with coloured LEDs that are so powerful that the lights from the car drivers, for example, can be well recognized even in the deep sun.
And it is also saving: The older light plants consume about 100 watts, the new one just eight watts.
There are three light systems per vehicle.
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian pushes the lamp button, the top radar sensor tests the traffic.
If the road is free, immediately green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian.
"If a group or disabled people go over the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will be safe on the road," said Arnold.
Of course, the driver should think here as a partner and observe the road.
This was not the case yesterday: barely showed the lamp for pedestrians green, a top-class vehicle blew through - in bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing for more than 30 years the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the insanity of language, the addiction to raw violence and stupid sexuality, the intensity and insanity - have often been described by the Kärntner poet.
The bookkeeper is known primarily as prosa author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher sets out for his performance "Weatherlights at the Zungspitze", which is now seen in the garage X at Petersplace, so a collage from Prosatexte.
The theatremaker combines some elements from the autobiographically marked novel "Der Lebeigene" (1987) with prosamiatures from "Leichnam, his family (2003).
On the vastly empty stage - important requirement: a velvety sofa, on which the sample is copied and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble depends on the text material.
The director of Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance covers the presentation with a full range of direct investment, known as the repertoire of post-dramatic gaming forms.
In particular, the actresses come to the bottom with some interesting scenario implementations.
They are deeply touched, with the head slammed under water, with their detachment attached to the wall.
Enforced in Cellophane or Mieder, they stick to dangerously high pieces through the stage, either monologizing loud or lying completely on the stage floor.
The text, however, is not in a position to do so.
The best moments have the evening when you sing - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to folk music.
In the end, the transverse performance is a bit of peace, and Winkler's after-sudden humour fades.
A blackbox in the car?
US-American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the falling highway system, and believe to have found the solution in a small black box that can be found in every car's storage board.
The devices that record every kilometres of risk and report the information to the authorities are the core of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the states to revise the obsolete system for financing US roads.
Usually the rather boring area of road planning has suddenly led to an intensive debate with colorful alliances.
Libertators have joined environmental groups and express themselves that the government can use the small boxes to record the dangerous kilometres – and possibly even where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax balances.
The Tea Party is disappointed.
The American Civilian Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But while you cannot agree to a move at the Congress, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can switch to a system during the next ten years when the driver pays per dangerous mile.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the drivers, some of whom are equipped with GPS surveillance.
This is really a must for our country.
“It’s nothing we can only use,” said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who has planned a record of the dangerous miles of all California drivers in the state since 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from the taxes that US-Americans make on the zip column, is graced.
But in America, no more is thought of as much as before.
Cars consume less petrol.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 Eurocents per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax at high prices, even to raise a cent.
"The fuel tax is simply not future," says Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with drivers to test a miles-based payment system.
"This is the long-term most sensible alternative," he said.
Bureaucrats refer to it as a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is found in urban liberals, for example, that tax should be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and greenhouse gas emissions.
The California Planners focus on the system in the development of strategies to achieve the ambitious, legally anchored goals of the state of the state for climate change.
However, the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees the longest possible long-term alternatives.
The free marketers of the Reasonon Foundation are also encouraged by the idea of allowing drivers to pay for a return route.
"This is not tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice-President of the Reasons.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers who in a 2011 report called on the Congress to move towards an abbreviation based on mail.
Last year, the US Senate approved a $90 million expensive pilot project involving 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the initiative and responded to the concerns of the representatives from rural areas, representing people who often have to leave many miles on their way to work or to the city.
Several states and major cities do not have to move in this direction on their own.
The most engaged is Oregon, which currently recruits 5,000 drivers for the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mile fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the Federal State.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also considers such a thing.
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with lkws.
And the I-95 coalition, to which the 17 Federal Ministers of Transport belong on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently examining how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the devices, drivers were skeptical of the idea that the government could pursue any of their movements.
"The concerns of Big Brother and such things were a major problem," explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Results Management in Nevada's Ministry of Transport.
The people didn't want it.
When the test began, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the drivers into adult surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a huge, blocked technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to record data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of federal states that are now looking for affordable technology, with which the state can record the traffic miles, but not exactly when and where.
So, like Khan, the public would be calmer as well.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company was not originally involved in helping the Federal States to tax drivers.
Rather, it was their goal to take foot in an emerging market for Kfz-insurance, where drivers would pay on the basis of the dangerous miles.
However, the devices tested by them are also interesting for road planners because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programs, major errors were made.
There are significantly cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners experiment with giving drivers a number of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose no device at all and instead pay a break fee on the basis of the average miles of all inhabitants of the Federal State.
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by providing the devices with more functions than with less.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a taxing device with which parking fees can also be paid, insurance must be paid only for dangerous kilometres and speed data from other vehicles can be collected in real time, thanks to their driver's staus.
“Auto riders would be motivated by the added value of the benefits offered by the system to participate,” says a city planning document.
Some traffic planners, however, wonder if the whole thing about paying per mile is not just a huge take-off manoeuvre.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials explained that the congress could simply solve the problem of the red Highway Trust Fund by increasing fuel tax.
An additional one-time fee or annual fee could be charged to drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is enough," explains Randy Rentschler, the head of the Commission's legislation and public affairs.
If we do so, hundreds of millions of drivers will take care of their privacy and many other things.
Kingsfield: Little team beats up
The Voluntary Firearm raped her Herb’s head sample despite lack of personnel with Bravour.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property of the Fed in the Burgberger Straße in his admission to the exercise.
There should have been a brief conclusion when sowing.
Two people were injured by the fire and the smoke development, one of which was able to send an emergency.
After the first review of the case by Hans Kammmerer, two air carriers of the ship were prepared to enter the building.
In a short time it was possible to find the first person and lead them to freedom.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as it was also a narrow step to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated staling for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There were lots of wood and also strawballs in it.
There were still electrical machines for wood processing.
The first disengagement took place over the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was made through an overflow hydrant in about 100 meters away.
Now three solvents could be formed.
A hole in the building was also used.
Hans Kammerer also went on to show what is to be done with the little staff available.
In the event of a serious accident, the King's Field Day Task Force will be supported.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and firms
On his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, Landtag President Guido Wolf was also told in Titisee-Neustadt where the workers come from tomorrow.
In the centre of funding, Hochschwarzwald met with the managers of the vocational schools as well as the circuit gymnasium and the chairmen of this important issue.
"Building is an important location factor", stressed Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school project Education Centre Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the funding centre, the circuit and the vocational school centre in the forest city.
He also praised family hospitality in the countryside.
"It is important to have not only the family phase in view, but also because of the demographic change the phase to care for family members," Wolf explained.
He also pointed out that more and more people were caring for the care and care of their families.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to the termination of the employment relationship," Wolf said.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"Because those who have already learned the advantages of the region during their study have often gained knowledge and skills from the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," said the President of the Landtag.
Because only if sufficient training places were offered can the technical needs be met.
In his opinion, the local advantage of the county is its beneficial location in southwestern Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
He also experienced on his train from Titise-Neustadt to Freiburg the efforts already made to expand public passenger transport.
"Continue to be hard on yourself and to make public transport better," he explained to the address of the local politicians in place.
With music experience a entertaining afternoon
For 15 years now, the Kaul family has invited the Dieting Seniors to coffee, cakes and then to a Vesper.
Previously, the senior citizens were recruited at the Rastststätte.
In the meantime, this afternoon will take place in the Pflegeheim St. Josef.
The natives are looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later, there was sausage salad.
With common melodies Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich were present.
The over 100 years old natural stone wall is to be re-established on the town of Brøunlingen's recovery plan as a pre-restriction of the old schoolyard for the refurbishment.
In the days before Kilbig, a small corner wall was built for stabilization and static discharge of the natural stone wall with balustrade during the first work of the refurbishment of the former schoolyard.
The next step is to include Alexander Misok from the Brünling City Building, the Landesdenkmalamt in the planning and to create a repair concept for the old wall.
Then a cost calculation is to be made by experts who are then to be placed on the table to decide and determine the next procedure.
A decision on this is expected to fall already in the coming year.
After the restoration, planting and planting of the old schoolyard within the two sides of the school built in 1912, the necessary limitation walls must be repaired and refurbished in due time as a consequence.
The historical, hundreds of years old demarcation wall of the old schoolyard on the Church Street is mainly due to water and frost damage, since there is no drainage, necessary recovery and has a boweling forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones are evidence of weather damage, but the wall is not currently in danger.
A more stable wall is a prerequisite for one of the students to use the schoolyard, which is done by the current fixation works.
Originally, school management was planned even in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditures brought a shift.
An important word in the historical school-building process, which has already been used for film recordings, will be discussed by the Landesdenkmalamt.
If requirements come from this site, then the city of Brünlingen hopes for grants from the memorial defenders.
The students of the Brøunling primary school, who are now being taught again in a well-furnished old school building with a new aula, can soon use the old school yard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
In the ongoing discussions about the future of the music universities in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, the Federal President of the Greens, has now become involved.
"I think it's wrong to give up the whole training at the Stuttgart Music School," said Özdemir the "Stuttgart News".
Jazz and classical are part of the Jazz site Stuttgart.
In this way, Özdemir, who is regarded as a favourite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate at the Federal elections on September 22nd, is opposed by the Green-Red Government.
On the basis of an expert study, this reinforces the reorganization of the five musical schools in Baden-Württemberg.
Then, among other things, the students Jazz and Pop will be transferred from the Stuttgart Music College to the Mannheim Music College.
US limit: "Super Tunnel" discovered for drug smuggling
At the border between Mexico and the United States, miners discovered and shut down a "super-tunnel" for drug smuggling.
As the U.S. customs authorities reported, the more than 500 meters long pipe between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, rail lines and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were then arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine seized.
The tunnel has not yet been used according to the data.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig through the radar," said U.S. Attorney General Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a camphouse in San Diego, where this was discovered at the end of the tunnel.
Turned to the drug gangs, Duffy assured: "If you continue to build and try to use such a tunnel, we are determined to make it a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a long-term fight against drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Constructed by Experts
Due to the extensive equipment of the tunnel, the detectors assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The trailer was so equipped that electrically operated vehicles could be used there.
On the Mexican side, the access is located in a building 80 meters from the border.
According to the authorities, a leader leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters wide.
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine finding.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for being accused of marijuana.
All three threaten as the ultimate punishment of lifelong freedom, as officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, it continued at the press conference in San Diego.
But it was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction.
Usually, cocaine is washed in small amounts and not by tunnel.
This shows the "development" of drug gangs whose traditional routes have now been cut off," said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug gang in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the United States.
No details were given to the prisoners, at least one six Mexicans, it was said.
You have to count on prison sentences for up to ten years.
2014 becomes Geisinger Festival
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
Again, the first historical reference is becoming ever closer.
If the year ends in good eight weeks, the anniversary will come.
Geisingen and Church Houses were mentioned for the first time in the journal.
In churches, a copy was produced, in which both places were mentioned.
On March 15th, there will be an official event for the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this event will take place in the place where the two were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in church houses.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned both in Geisingen and in church houses.
Church houses will be held in July at a weekend from 18 to 20 July in 1250.
Celebrate again.
On Friday with a holiday, on Saturday and Sunday with a party around the church hall.
Also on this weekend is the church-house church feast.
The city music director Rudolf Barth has written a contract composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which is listed on three dates.
On 21 June, together with the sunscreen festival of the Black Forest Association, on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of urban music in the new Festival Hall.
This is completed and celebrated in the Jubilee year, the official date is the last weekend, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger City Jubilee, a new chronicle will also be issued.
"But it should become not only a chronicle of Geisingen itself, but a printed work on the Geisingen of today's Geisingen, which is made up of Geisingen, Church-houses, Leipzig, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And also today's Geising celebrates 2014 birthday, 1974 the present space was completed with the invitations.
The new chronicle will then be presented at the new Festival Hall in Geisingen on November 21 or 22.
But 2014 is also another year with many Jubilees.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki begins on February 8th with a breakfast evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmony Goodmadingen will be 90 years old and will have the feast banquet on March 29th, and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1 to 4.
The old factory Leipzig will be 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and will celebrate it on 10 May, the music association Polyhymnia Leipzig will be 150 years old and celebrates it in the framework of the fountain festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a gift certificate, owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The paper was produced in churches (houses), which was then a courtroom.
Therefore, both communities are mentioned in the same letter.
Due to 2014 this 1250-year-old is to celebrate, in addition the common reform remains 40 years.
Council adopts guidelines for the use of road transport in the field of transport
Whether the "To Do" transition should be repeated continuously to increase the traffic security
Yes, the municipalities have decided.
Schiltach has to take over 220,000 euros for this.
The Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway route in the coming year.
In particular, it is intended to increase the safety of railway crossings - regularly it comes to collisions of trains with other vehicles across the country.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they must participate with a third of the costs, the rest share railways and the federal.
Schiltachs Stadtbameister Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipality the particulars of the pass "At Hirschen".
There the city plans to build an expansion in the height of the tunnel mundane west of the railway tracks.
There could also be larger vehicles, such as those transporting longwood, when they are on the road, without having to block the tracks.
Therefore, Greßhaber proposed to construct a necessary support wall so that the city could expand the road next to the time given to ensure a smooth traffic flow.
This was discussed in the community dispute, as some councils questioned the need for road distribution: Thomas Kipp, in his statement, put the attitude of critics to the point: "Should we take so much money into our hands because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas objected: The "Hirschen" train is regularly used for long wooden transport.
Even wood from the area of "Kuhbach" will be transported partly through this route because the vehicles up to 20 metres long could not use the route at the Haverles bridge, because they could not turn to the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a route for those vehicles which may not use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, argued Haas.
It should be noted that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels had to be rebuilt and repaired, as is currently the case in Wolffak, could also have an important effect on the "Hirschen" train crossing for a longer period of time.
The Council agreed to investigate the costs of the alleged expansion of the road.
Notwithstanding this, it was largely agreed that the necessary support wall was built so that the city could expand the road towards the railway station road, if necessary, to approximately 5.5 metres for road traffic.
On the other hand, the reconstruction of the railway crossing at Gerbei Trautwein could be a very different problem, which concerns access to the highly rising "Geroltzhauser road".
The administration had examined the refurbishment plans of the railway from the Breinlinger Engineering Office, as it had doubts whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhausen road was still possible.
The investigation concluded that it was not to be excluded that the road's inclination conditions could lead to longer vehicles being seated.
In turn, the city is responsible for this.
The refurbishment could thus lead to debt disputes.
Since both the wooden transport and the bending worked in the current state of expansion, one should not agree to the conversion of the rail crossing, argued Haas.
At this point too, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle at the crossing is significantly lower than that of the other railway crossings, because there is also the centre of the stop point to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main station had to be pulled off in this place so far that no collision was threatening.
Mostly, the refurbishment of this crossing was denied approval, as the city of Schiltach had to "discharge" the problem with sitting vehicles, so the councils, as the railway could withdraw from the responsibility after completion of the construction work.
As unproblemically, the board considers the conversions to the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach", for which cross-border agreements have already been concluded with the railway.
Esa decides on major space missions: missions for billions
Far from planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from European space agencies now have to agree on two major projects they want to start in the coming years.
30 proposals were selected, five are still in the race.
Faraway worlds.
More than 1,000 planets have already found astronomers on other stars.
If there's at least some of it alive, nobody knows.
The selection is difficult to find: Whether to search for gravitational waves
Or would you like to explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or are they going after such planets and thus perhaps discovering extraterrestrial life?
These questions are precisely the responsibility of the Esa European Space Agency.
For her "Cosmic Vision" program, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are crucial for research.
The state for such "L-missions" is approximately a billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the European Space Research elite met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 There were ideas for debate, five of which have now come into the narrower choice.
Numerous bodies examined the proposals, looking for the researchers.
In the coming days a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
A total of four major questions the Esa has chosen to find answers to the missions of the 2007 "Cosmic Vision" programme.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The precise processes of the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets that surround these stars - are still in the verbal darkness.
A large infrared telescope in all could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to address this question, in 2017 the space telescope "Cheops" will start to explore more closely the 500 already known planet systems in our vicinity.
The possibilities are limited, however, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could paint similar planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and thus look for "biomarkers": gases that are considered to be an index of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question is also to be considered in the final analysis of the conditions for the emergence of life.
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and its particle radiation with the planet system.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined by example.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the Esa has already approved a mission of the M-Class (there the budget is about half a billion euros) on this issue.
The probe will start in 2017 and monitor the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and his moon are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
For this, the Esa is the first of the total three L missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The Juice (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) probe is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later she reaches Jupiter and is going to explore the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moon of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The World All offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the laws we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also variations that could lead the physicists to a new theory, under which all known laws of nature can be brought together.
How did the universe come into existence and from what?
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos was created by the Urknal.
In addition to the ongoing matter, from the stars, planets and living things like us, there is dark matter, whose gravity is composed of galaxies and galaxies, and dark energy, through which the expansion of the universe is accelerated.
So far, researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first seconds of the urnnal, nor where dark matter and dark energy existed.
With "Euclide", the Esa has already approved an M-mission, which is scheduled to start in 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the whole sky, thus allowing feedback to the supply of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race?
Of the 30 proposals, only two will be left at the end of the selection procedure.
According to many experts, "E-Lisa" has the best chance of a mandate as an L-Mission, a demanding concept for evidence of gravitational waves.
Among these are physical changes in the structure of space time, which Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to date.
Elisha could do that, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission provides an existing two or three probe detector that is stationed in all.
In contrast to plants on the earth, it could also prove gravitational waves created by the urn and thus provide new insights into the origin of the cosmos.
Four further proposals are still competing for the second L-Mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which is to detect and investigate such planets.
Proposals for sample transport from Mars, for the exploration of moons, Venus and asteroids and for solar physics have already been made.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the Whistleblower of the US Secret Service, has stated that he is ready to travel to Berlin and say before the German Federal Day if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give answers about their activities.
The German member Hans-Christian Ströblee met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received this asylum to discuss the statement in Germany with him.
In a letter from Snowden, presented on Friday by Ströbele to the media in Berlin, he writes: “Even if the result of my efforts proved positive, my government continues to treat a different opinion as a breach of trust and tries to criminalise political opinion with criminal threats where no defense is possible.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to drop the charges against him.
The charges raised by the US Ministry of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said regarding time online: "If Mr. Snowden is willing to speak with German representatives, then we will find ways to do so."
The relationship between the USA and Germany is burdened by the claims that the NSA has stopped the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the honourable Member, who is leading the Parliamentary Committee responsible for the secret service, explained that we should take the opportunity to hear Snowden as a witness, if possible, "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States".
Ströbele, a Green MP, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists on his visit to Russia.
Ströblee explained that according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
When Snowden speaks in Germany, he needs assurance that he is "safe" there, so the honourable Member.
Snowden explains in his letter that he is exposed to a “stupid and ongoing” campaign of persecution that drove him out of his home.
However, he was affected by the global reaction to 'my act of political opinion'.
Citizens all over the world, as well as high-ranking politicians – also in the United States – have referred to the revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive supervision as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation "if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been solved".
Frontier Airlines collects fees for handbags
Frontier Airlines plans to require up to 100 US dollars of passengers who want to steal handbags on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to 100 US dollars for a piece of handbag and 2 dollars for coffee or lemonade, even if it was to be read in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers should keep the entire dose.
The new fee applies to handbags in the luggage bag over the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier explained that 25 US dollars are calculated when the fee is paid in advance, and 100 US dollars for travellers who only paid on the flight path.
Frontier speaker Kate O'Malley said that the $100 fee is intended to move travellers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We do not want to calculate this sum," she explained.
Air carriers began in 2008 to demand charges for the first and second items in luggage.
Passengers who tried to handle these have therefore stopped as much as possible into the hand luggage, which has the effect that the luggage bags are often overcrowded over the seat.
Fees are an opportunity to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee doesn't really make it to earn money.
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier who had clearly expressed that it would be harder to find a place in the section over the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger on the flight path from Frontier may carry a luggage free of charge, but the next person must pay $100 for a comparable luggage.
O'Malley explained that the website of Frontier and the check-in procedures would change, so that passengers were informed about the fee before they arrived at the flight path.
The new handbag fee of Frontier will only enter into force in the summer, a precise date is not yet available.
Passengers often cheat on luggage and other charges, but airlines are happy to get back on it.
They argue that the transportation of the luggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they want it.
Many at Wall Street view the new luggage charges as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of flights after years of losses.
Most of them, however, have to pay the finger for handbags.
Spirit Airlines Inc. claimed three years ago as the first fee for hand luggage and later followed Allegiant Air, also a flight ticket.
The only other airline with such a fee was the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained airline advisor Jay Sorensen, who carefully followed the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the handbag fee is 50 million US dollars a year.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, was recently flown with spirit and was curious what he would expect on the flight path if passengers were confronted with the company's unusual luggage fee.
"The boarding process was one of the most smooth things I've ever experienced in my career on the air," he said.
I expected to see dentists and handcuff discussions on the flight path.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding went like a mess."
Frontier also follows Spirit with the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers, who bought lemonade or juice, should keep the whole dose and be filled free of charge.
Water is still free.
US Airways had recently tried to demand money for refreshment drinks in 2008, but this made it back seven months later after passengers had complained and no other large company had been sought.
Frontier's step to raise fees for the hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to be linked to the customer's website.
Airlines pay online travel offices such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per sold ticket.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to direct purchases with them instead of via an online travel office.
However, borderier has gone the best in this area.
In September, the company began to forgive only half of the number of flyers when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced to 25 per cent of the flight route.
A flight trip with a third party with a border of more than 1000 miles is therefore only 250 miles away.
Passengers can also book directly on the website of Frontier places.
Frontier has a loyal customer tribe at his seat in Denver, but the business is shrunk and the company loses money.
The recovery went back by 9 percent and the flight capacity declined by almost 13 percent in the first quarter, as is the case in the financial report published by the Republic Airways Holdings Inc. on Wednesday.
The Republic has tried to get the funds from Frontier in the framework of the sale of the company.
Words From the Bible
Good 40 women visited the last women's breakfast this year in the Evangelical Church of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the community house was "Bible Words" and "Middle Age Talks".
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the church community council, followed the breakfast in a talk on the Bible proverbs.
"Speakers contain life instructions, regulations or warnings," she explained.
She compared several words with the corresponding Bible verses and explained the meaning.
She called words like, "Be careful how the eyes fall from the eye, throw an eye on someone, His eyes are in the Lord's sleep, wash his hands in innocence."
On several occasions, the rapporteur also suggested to her listeners what kind of speech it was.
The themes of the Middle Ages were adopted by the church community Christel Dehner: All good things are three, making blue, making a bit of a fuss.
She explained the importance and origin of the speeches she called " bridges in the past".
A Tombola was released at the end.
The prices were covered on a table and were humourfully described before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round, the mayor's candidate was Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for young people in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism sector was launched at the Mecklenburg Lake Plate.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as undergraduates in the industry are expected to be qualified as professionals for hotels and guest houses over three winters.
"New is that the six-month courses end with conclusions," said Carmen Wiechert from the Neubrandenburg Labour Agency.
The benefits are diverse: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would be struggling with trained professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and hostels, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also includes the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the Deutsche Hotel & Hospital Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA explains that a "internal error" and not hacker is the blame on the site's crash
The shadowy National Security Agency stated on the late Friday, an error has put its public website a few hours ago and not hacker, as was claimed online.
“NSA.gov was not reachable for some hours tonight, as an internal error occurred during a planned update,” explained the spy agency in an e-mail message.
The problem will be solved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early hours of the evening, online server trackers occurred that the NSA website was not available for at least six hours for at least six hours, and this is still not for some users.
Previously, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the Authority's sensitive internal network was "in no way" compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, so the speaker.
At least one group of hackivists claimed to have placed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In the event of such attacks, the target website will be overflowed with page tippings until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
The cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not intended to interfere with the internal network of the target system.
The former super secret NSA, whose name was once No Search Agency (No such authority), is now in the light of the public and is seen in the light of the discoveries made in recent months about its extensive surveillance programme in the country and abroad – a result of secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA staff Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy over the secret service led to initial speculation that the case today was the result of a targeted Cyprus operation.
The number of people without a job is slightly reduced from 22 to 1,307 in October.
Although the quota was 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, Deputy Managing Director of the Agency for Labour in Sonthofen.
Because many companies have reacted to settings.
One reason for this is according to Felder-Bauer: "We have little expertise in handwork, health and care".
Year-olds have continued to offer job offers for staff in the hotel and guest shop since September.
In mid-December, the winter season begins there.
The full background report for this is available in the Allgäuer advertigeblatt of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Earnings at Bombardier after decrease in delivery and orders
On Thursday, the Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent decrease in net profit after he had been under pressure by late orders and deliveries to third-quarter aircraft as well as contract problems in the railway party.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also published no flight test data for his new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information as to whether the aircraft could go to commercial use in the next September in accordance with the ambitious timetable.
The flight of the test aircraft was followed by only three other start-ups a few months ago, which shows whether the test phase is going as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a course shift of more than eight percent at Toronto's stock exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment of "outperform" on "sector performance" on Thursday to the fact that the stock has a limited price potential in the next one to two quarters.
"Although poorer delivery rates for aircraft have been widely expected, we are clearly disappointed by the development of the margin in the transport sector," Duerksen said in a customer letter.
We are of the opinion that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test programme for the aircraft is advanced.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, then we expect the market to become more skeptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CS series can catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented in March to the public and fled after months of delays for the first time in September.
However, binding orders for CSeries with 177 are still moderate, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings of the new diesel vehicle are relevant.
Currently there are 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Chairman of the Board Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet.
The company management also assured the analysts and media on Thursday, and the program is in the timetable.
"The test aircraft was no longer on the ground than expected," Beaudoin said at a telephone conference and added, while the aircraft's stand-by time was running ground tests and software updates.
Every manufacturer has a different plant.
We have decided to take the first flight and then attach a processing period, as we have done.
This happens during the entire flight program.
The second of five test planes is expected to start in the next few weeks, the rest of which was called from the company side.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical whether they can operate a CSerie aircraft 12 months after the first customer’s flight.
Bombardier explained that it was reviewing the implementation planning (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
“The slow advance of the flight test – even if it is obviously in line with Bombardi’s internal planning – strengthens our view that the deployment will shift to the first quarter of 2015,” Derksen said.
In the third quarter at the end of September 30th, Bombardi's net earnings fell to 147 million dollars or 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars or 9 cents per share a year before.
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged 9 cents.
The sales ran low and fell from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a 10 cent gain per share and a sales of $4.56 billion, as Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer reported that it delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The mandate of the Air and Space Party amounted to $32.9 billion on 30 September and was unchanged compared to 31 December.
"In the field of air and space transport, the results were disappointing as a result of our requirements, but the low level of procurement and market conditions were disappointing at all," Beaudoin said.
Turnover in the air and space segment fell by 13 per cent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this sector increased by almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The ordering stock in the Transport Party amounted to $32.6 billion on September 30th and was thus slightly increased compared to December 31.
The volume of profits in the field of transport has been affected by settlement problems in some major contracts.
According to the management of the company, there will be new standards for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier stock accounted for 8.5% and stayed at 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was announced that the Google Finance Manager Patrick Pichette will change into the board.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's narrowest rival, reported a ten percent decline in quarterly profits on Thursday.
USA: Shots at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fired shots on Friday morning (location time) at the LAX airport.
While the airport manager told Twitter about the short notice service, the shooter was cautious, the "Los Angeles Times" reported, the man was dead.
A security man was killed, too.
The media also reported several injuries.
US President Barack Obama was constantly informed of the situation, said the speaker of the White House, Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses reported having seen a gun with a gun in one of the departure halls, as several media reported.
A traveler told the CNN sender, many people had been looking for in panic protection.
Travelers would have screamed and crying.
While waiting, panic broke out, many would have been hiding out of fear behind chairs.
He heard two shots, says a traveler of the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the TSA security authority has suffered a gunshot injury at the foot.
The scene was "like in a movie".
Then he himself was brought into a security area, the man reported.
The shots should be close to a security control area.
Evacuated airport building
On television images, it was seen how many hospitals and police cars drove ahead of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were taken out of the building.
Users on Twitter posted photos of a special application command and a weapon lying on the ground.
As the airport manager announced on Twitter, the event began at 9.30 a.m. (place time).
The access roads were blocked, which, according to CNN, resulted in a long return.
Until air traffic was temporarily suspended on landings, it was said.
However, several flights were also to be observed on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller US airlines.
Los Angeles Airport is one of the largest airports in the United States.
A cocaine addict who warned the drug boss before police investigation must go to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided information on subworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced by Liverpool Crown Court to three years in prison
A known criminal who warned a drug baron before a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug search could be discovered, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his drug-trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The criminal lawyer named Bash was arrested in his home in 2011 after the Scarborough police had watched him represent in an earlier drug procedure.
Officials observed how Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he and his colleagues were at a meal in the lawyer's room.
The findings added that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after testing traces of cocaine in his hair, on his pocket and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 others, they were later arrested after the police secured heroin and cocaine in a series of domestic investigations worth 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds in cash.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the office of Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two prosecutions due to the lack of justice.
He gave the cocaine possession in an earlier survey.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found in their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Dittas' house and lay the drugs there with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf shoe under the lawyer's mill tone.
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly called with Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers Football Stadium in Ewood Park at dinner.
The lawyer returned home, got the drugs, and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
In court it was known that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after testing drugs of Class A in his hair, pocket and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but argued to take cocaine and said that he had spoken to the moderate dealer because he was his mandate, and claimed that his discussion was subject to the "secretity of attorney".
During his arrest, Ditta took his pocket and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him.
At the police hearing, he reported that he was operating both under his private address and at the workplace, an office and an agent would call him home for legal matters.
It was announced before the Court that he had called for significant arrests and informed important actors of the drug trade, some of which he had previously represented, about what the investigators knew about them.
State attorney Anne Whyte said: "A criminal lawyer should know better than all others that the law is not violated."
The abuse of his position as a criminal defender is accused of this because he has become too involved with certain mandates.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but that of a drug dealer who provides his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, since he was the lawyer of these persons.
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between the lawyer and the officer.
He acted against police investigations as far as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta thus brought his profession to a standstill.
He was close to certain mandates, especially Scarborough, and he suggested that his independence was compromised.
Ditta said every misbehaviour: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but do it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta has taken the step of a criminal defender to a criminal at the time he began to acquire drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime who commissioned him to collect valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence.
This trust has gone back and tries to fade behind the façade of his profession.
The serial and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta, which also led to a three-case conviction for possession of cocaine and justice, which underscored our determination to bring criminals to trial.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can withdraw from the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he had declared himself guilty of the conspiracy against heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five others involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to 153 years' imprisonment for drugrelated offences.
On his website Ditta published an area with questions and answers about himself, in which he indicated that his dream job was to represent as an attorney for the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and opportunity inequality was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary Work of Church Music
To conclude the celebrations due to its 160-year-old existence, the song cross Dunningen is framed by two services with the "German fair" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which thrilled the audience this spring, the song song will enrich the completion of the anniversary year with the performance of the German fair by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary fair will be heard from 19 during the evening fair in St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, 27 October, from 10.15 a.m. to the service in St. John Baptist church in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title "Songs to the celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual music work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost revolutionary at the time of his birth.
The fair is presented in the framework of the services, as the contracting entity Johann Philip Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the band of the Frogsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepsy soft looks trust
With the elections to the parish community in 2015, for example, Haslach (SE) will change fundamentally.
There is then only one common parish community for all six parishes.
At a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welchensteinach prepared for the changes.
Because the basic decisions of the diocese are no longer to be changed and it is for the parish authorities to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
During the day, it became particularly clear: the skepsis vis-à-vis the new one is slowing down, but in the face of confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish community, the extremely constructive talks of the six bodies with the main officials of the soul body team are taking place.
Regionaldekan Georg Schmitt explained on the basis of a presentation the new guidelines for mental care units in the Erzdiözese Freiburg.
The SE Haslach as a church community will then form a body of public law which enters into the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities.
There will only be a common parish council and a board of foundations, in which the parishioner force of the Office is represented.
Of each parish, at least two elected members are to be represented, in which six parishes are formed on the spot.
Your mission will be to promote church life in the place.
On the question of the finances of the individual parish community, there was then a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide that collected goods remain in the parishes for use.
On the other hand, the commitments go to the general community.
In particular, with regard to the large planned investments, whose commitment then meets all parishes, there were great concerns.
"Even in the past, it was only invested in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone," said President Bruno Prenzbach of the parish community.
Practical experience with a joint board for five parishes painted Barbara Ritter, the chairman of the board in the soul care unit Schutterwald-Neurided.
They had made 2006 the task of "become one, stay five" and had to find that it was not that simple.
The bodies of the Haslacher Mental Care Unit were then asked to answer questions about the future composition and size of the common parish community as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The preparations will be made at further meetings and decided at another joint meeting of all six bodies in the spring.
At the end, Michael Schöner, from Steinach, presented the new logo of the mental care unit, which was agreed with a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
Citizens of Pfullendorf have to adjust to higher power costs.
As the manager of the city works, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed against the SÜDKURIER, adds to a four-head Pfullendorfer family 70 to 90 Euros extra charge per year.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC deposit from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This conversion is re-established every year in October by the four operators of the major power lines.
These relate to the extra costs that come from the energy shift, which they can raise by a conversion over the electricity price.
The city works Pfullendorf form the last piece in this chain.
The supervisory board of the energy company had even come out of a higher environment in its forecasts, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete payments had to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We're going from a 1 cent plus x increase," says Bias, where the number will be closer to the 2 cents.
Lamp on permanent red: Eight on waiting time
Sometimes a lamp just won't be green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the light sign is defective.
What should you do - drive at red?
If a concerned person has waited long enough for a red lamp and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains Stuttgart Lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, waiting time should be "accepted" which can be otherwise otherwise designed.
Becker advises to wait at least five minutes before leaving a malfunction of the lamp.
However, if the journey continues despite red light, it must be clear that it bears the full blame for an accident caused by it.
If a person is less than five minutes of patience does not wait long under circumstances, Becker warns and refers to a decision of the Supreme Court of Hamm.
In the case negotiated, a driver had ignored the lamp after about three minutes of permanent red and had to be responsible for a sudden red light failure.
The lamp wasn't defective, but it just jumped to green later.
A road ban was spared because of the special situation - but not the money penalty.
The community is happy about a solid budget
Whenever it comes to municipal meetings around the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipal deck in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debts are no longer known to the administration since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be seen as a success in this respect.
This was evident in the presentation of the 2012 annual accounts.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around 7.6 million euros was higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget is also around EUR 1.8 million over the approach.
Thanks to the surplus, above all, is higher tax revenue and the share of income tax.
The property budget was also clear again about the planned values.
Instead of the planned EUR 1.5 million, it amounted to EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is essentially the higher delivery from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
As investments have been made less than planned in the 2012 financial year, the backlog is also higher.
Overall, the overall decrease of around €2.1 million could now be increased to €4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work.
"So a work is not simply shielded from the sleeve," Gerster praised with a view to the annual bill.
He and the municipalities are obviously happy about the good numbers.
It may sound paradox, but these good numbers could soon be expensive for the citizens.
Because of the good financial situation, the congregation in the past was able to ignore high standards.
As a result, according to Gerster, frequent subsidies have already been cut off from the country.
There are conditions for these subsidies from various compensatory units.
Among other things, the cities and communities that apply for grants must have certain ephemerals.
"We need to look at the issue of housing, as investments for which we would like to be made in the coming years are under way," Gerster announced in this regard.
Nagold: Hugo Vermter for 60 years in the choir
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter's story is at the Men's Singer Cácilia almost twice as long as the Herb Festival in which he was celebrated.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colours of his male singers.
Even after 60 years, the song with the present will probably make him even more fun than the favorite chorus.
Wermter was also active in the association, including for 28 years as a member of the Committee.
For his engagement and association, he received a number of awards: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Rapporteur on behalf of the Cácilien association Rottenburg-Stuttgart, handed him a letter of honour, signed by Bishop Gebhard Prince, as the choir is also a church choir.
His colleagues handed him the certificate of the German choir association as well as a engraved tin counter.
In addition to the honor, the 31st autumn festival was held in usual tracks: with the MGV Betra, the singer's cross-section Salzstetten, the singing department Baisingen and the local music association, the Fullmaringer had loaded a colorful mix of different audiences and singing styles that held about 400 visitors.
The MGV full-maringer opened with vocal songs such as "In the Wine Paradise" and "Listen, your brothers".
Their honorary singer Hubert Vermter prepared a small stand for honor - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslide".
The male singer Betra also sang classical choir songs like "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Where, far away" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When you go through the valley".
With his mixed choir and his group of women - the "impulsory" - the women's rate of the festival, the song was taken by Salzstetten.
The mixed choir took off with the Neapolitan people's "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "impulsor" also came back to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singing department of the Baisinger Sports Association came back to home field with "What's wrong with Schwab?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Paperts "Bierlied" where the Fullmaringer Music Association offered the crowning musical ending.
For the children, there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannlore Stollteimer introduced a Kasperltheater and read a few stories that the children enjoyed on Wednesday.
Children's Dreams Become True
The children's gardens and children's places in the Zollernal district are given post in these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Black Forest Bote wants to support the institutions in the realization of their construction and decoration desires.
Does the kindergarten need a new sand box?
Participation in the action may include all kindergartens, childcare facilities and children's hips from the entire Zollernal district.
If you have a desire for construction or decoration for your facility, you can apply for this at the Black Forest.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action Children's Garden building.
A jury, composed of representatives of Schwarzwälder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all shipments.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be realized with construction material of a maximum value of 2000 Euro and on a (action-) day.
In addition, the winner himself must provide for many flexible construction aids.
What about the action day and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It is delivered to the kindergartens on the agreed day and is then to be processed directly by the helpers.
Help can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and, of course, the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan Press Empires About Controversial Media Act
"We are in a frightening situation, and we can ask ourselves, what does this Parliament have to do with simply eliminating the right independence tomorrow?" was the newspaper that held the draft legislation as unconstitutional.
"The law is draconic and very criminal and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of the most prominent independent radio stations and news websites in Kenya.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be taken forward because it is an extended arm of the government" and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government takes "the media effectively into a guise" by the new law. However, The Standard, Democracy and Freedom of Speech in Kenya had suffered "a severe blow" and considered the draft as "draconic".
The adoption of the Act is part of a series of measures to strengthen national security in the aftermath of the attacks by armed Islamists at the Westgate Shopping Centre in September.
The Kenyan media drew on the anger of the authorities because they published footage of security cameras, on which it was to be seen how the units sent to the factory allegedly robbed the luxurious shopping centre.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded to this by ordering two journalists and a leading media representative to be interviewed, even if the pre-loading was withdrawn after a media call.
Under the new law, media houses with a fine of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings can be imposed and individual journalists with up to one million as well as the other risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Court also has the right to seize the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, "the only penalty can force most radio broadcasters into the bankruptcy".
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's "living blogosphere".
If they were to rob the media of silence, politicians could do without punishment whatever they wanted.
"No one will ever experience it," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation, who refers to Kenyan media as a crucial control factor in public life.
"If politicians are left alone, they will lead the country to the Bankruptcy and bring us back to the time of hunters and collectors," he commented.
In the past, the Kenyan legislators have already raised public concerns.
In May, they agreed to withdraw the reductions ordered by the National Compensation Commission and re-entered their fines of about 532,000 shillings tax-free per month – they are among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A Dream Becomes True for the FC
In spite of the cold weather and rain, the official ceremony for the art race sports place was of no importance to the city and football club.
A more pleasant holiday season was probably all desired on Saturday, but Peter did not want to play with it.
So all those who came without a rainscreen or could not hold one for any reason.
It was the musicians who celebrated the feast, just like some speakers.
For this reason, Nass also became the FC President Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
He thanked all the mayor Walter Klumpp, who had made a strong commitment to the implementation of the project, the municipality, the participating companies and members of the associations who joined.
Here especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The rusty tenants placed 400 square meters of plaster stone for the new routes.
This remarkable honourary commitment was also appreciated by the Land-Agent Karl Rombach.
Other words were addressed to the urban sports committee Hubert Baier, the district president of the Southern Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation to the club's youth department.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that repeated weather-related influences in the spring and autumn were added to the original lawn so that he could not be played.
Already 15 years ago, there were the first discussions to solve the problem when a third place was thought of building a third place on the ground of the football club or at the real school at the Salinensee.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago thoughts came up about the establishment of an art race sports venue, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Specific plans were taken two years ago when the FC took over the template in succession, claimed a cost-sharing of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the site and validated the country's funding of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining 356,000 euros at the total cost of 560,000 euros, which was combined with Klumpp.
The construction of 68 times 108 meters of large art lawns took place on 4 June.
During the three-month construction phase, 3,000 cubic metres of earth were decomposed, half of which was used for the installation of a Dirt Bike route.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on internal affairs and justice.
To this end, the responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is direct democracy, the appointment of deputies and the federal police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its consultations.
This should include the issue of dual citizenship, where both sides have conflicting ideas.
The SPD wants to end the obligation for immigrant children born in Germany to decide to end - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of transport, which is not on the agenda on Friday, the SPD undermined its no-one to a pkw-maut required by the CSU.
A Vignette was a "platrate for multimodal and thus ecologically counterproductive", explained the SPD negotiating leader for the topic of transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There were threats of diversion on roads that are already crashing points.
The introduction of a wall for all pkw from the perspective of Pronolds would also be just a first step.
"There is a danger that the compensation for German will be abolished at a later time," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing wave on the freelance stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be right again summer?" was not actually the question on Friday evening at the Freelance Ball Killesberg.
It was truly a tropical night in Stuttgart.
So the best conditions for the battle star Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.

Car driver seriously injured in accident
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old passenger from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was on his way with her car on the Kempener Outerring in the direction of Grefrath.
When she wanted to turn left on St. Toniser Street, she missed the next car of the 37-year-old.
The caravans were colliding.
The Aachener suffered serious injuries and had to be brought to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: Distortion after accident on the sleep cycle
The accident was reported by the police when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza on Thursday evening, 20 a.m., drove out of town on the left track of the two-legged Reichenaustraße.
Shortly before the circuit traffic at the Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left-wing track towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and changed to the right track.
This led to a collision with the 23-year-old BMW running there.
The VW pass behind the BMW was also damaged by a 19-year-old.
A total of about 15,000 Sachsen was born, the police reported.
The road had to be blocked during the accident, it continued.
Vienna Airport manages passenger charges
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
There will be no more visas such as this in the future at the Vienna-Schwechat Airport.
A large part of the speakers' speeches fall away - the noise level is to be significantly reduced.
To create a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this renewal.
As Airport Speaker Peter Kleemann announced against Radio Wien, Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the setting of visas for individuals.
Thus, among other things, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already giving up on the alarming calls.
By the way, on average, about 200 personal calls were made by the speakers on a day-to-day basis, it is expected to be more quiet at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual experiences have been relatively little perceived, but at the same time all other information about modified flights or departure times is a bit lower here," said Kleemann in the conversation with the radio broadcaster.
Highlander games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to the braking car with tractors, there is a second match at the agricultural autumn festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7, the Highlander Games begin at 1.30 p.m.
They have a Scottish tradition, but they are swathed at the Kaltenhof.
Teams and individual fighters are measured in the disciplines of tree stems, pits and water intakes.
Four-and-a-half meters is the tree trunk long and 25 to 30 kilograms hard.
"It doesn't go far," says organizer Peter Saile.
The tribe must be cast vertically, be overcome once and then just lie down.
This is assessed with most of the points.
In the case of pituitary discharges, the target is accurate.
From the distance of eight meters it will be thrown onto a plock.
Efficacy and strength must be demonstrated by the participants in water intake above 50 metres.
Time and quantity of water in a bottle will be measured at the end.
From each of the "Clan" teams, two may participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive prizes.
It can be trained from 10 a.m.
Wishing is a suitable dress, for example, the fighters can enter the bulkhead.
But also swibic stroke is allowed.
For "Outfit" the jury gives a few more bonus points.
You can sign up for an hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swedish Highlander Games and the Tractor Pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action has been said on the mainland on Saturday.
In the evening, the fans will come at their own expense.
At 19:00 a.m., the evaporator-blessing music from Schömberg forms the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays beautiful Polkas and Mersche.
Its repertoire, however, also includes sensitive rollers and a soft big band sound.
With this, the Heinz Koch will be known as the singing host and black-haired baron from among the cattle.
In Dornhan he has already appeared in the Christmas market and in the Narrenzoft.
On Sunday, the Musikverein Leinstetten holds breakfast, from 14 o'clock, the Böffingen farm is a guest, and the "Oldies" then let the party off.
On Friday is already the Stoppacker Party with DJ Ralf.
Other programme items include the old-time and leisure meeting on Saturdays and Sundays, exhibitions of companies on the topic of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the Maslabyrinth, the Handicraft market and the Schafscheren.
There is a streichelzoo, Strohüpfburg, Tractor Road (under instructions) and Tractor Surfing for children.
The organizers are the Förderverein Mehrzeckhalle, the ski club and the tractor-friends "Windkäpsele".
Overview of milk and egg alternatives
Vegan diet requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products.
Purified tofu with plant seed is, for example, a quartz set.
The Vegetarian Foundation is also known as the World Vegantag on 1 November.
On the occasion of the World Vegetarian Day on 1 November, the Vegetarian Federation of Germany proposes a series of vegan alternatives:
Pure vegetable margarine is a good alternative to butter, let yoghurt be replaced by soja yoghurt.
Instead of milk, soya, hazelnut, almond or rice milk may be used.
Affluenceable plants tend to replace common bivalve molluscs.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
For example, a half straight, mature banana can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple or a tablecloth muffled linens plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
Luckers instead of eggs are made of eggs with a mixture of a teaspoon of Back powder, a tablespoon of food strength and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of sojayoghurt or seidentofu can meet this purpose.
According to the Vebu data, about 800 000 people are currently fed in Germany, i.e. pure vegetable.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest Gymnasium met the American capital New York.
After eight hours the flight went straight to Brooklyn Bridge, over which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached by foot.
Here is already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which in the evening is a special trip.
Due to the shift in time, the students were almost 24 hours on their legs, but faithful to the motto "The city does not sleep" was decided on the day at Times Square.
Despite Shutdown, on the second day, the state of freedom was able to be reached with a ferry and to be reached on foot.
Then it went through the financial centre around the Wall Street to the memorial of September 11.
On the third day, the students from the 373 meters high view platform of the Empire state building were able to gain an overview of the fascinating big city and enjoy the view.
Then it went through the hectic driving of the New York streets through the Rockefeller Center to the Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity for short stays in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students now arrive in their host families and experience the day of school at the Weymouth High School.
This year too, on the day of the name of the Holy Hubertus in the parish church of St. Mary at the Hülsbergstraße, a Hubertus fair is celebrated.
St. Hubertus was a rather thoughtless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Lüttich.
The hunting group of hunters westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth musses on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood Es) after old, original French melodies.
The blouses wear riding clothes because they primarily accompany riders, horses and dogs on toddlers musically.
The festive fair takes place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed set-up shines with a new coffee.
One that invites you to stay and return.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
As Déjà Vu it is said to be a psychological phenomenon that is expressed in the feeling of having already experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of the visit of the same-name café at the strike in Kleve County in view of the Rhein-Waal University, it must not remain in the pure feeling of Déjà Vu.
Finally, the café with the nice name has exactly that goal: to make a real stay not only thankful, but always hand-festable.
Because it's just fun and it's just beautiful.
A look into the inner life at stock 8 gives the viewer a good feeling.
The high-modern but not cool café environment looks like a place to feel well.
Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top of the guest with various coffee or cocktail variants.
For this, there are delicious cakes or individually made fresh buguettes.
The owners, both 33 years of age, have already made a name for themselves before the opening of the beautiful café as gastronomists: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve to the strike, the sympathetic café lovers hope for more audiences.
Not least by the university.
"Where we do not have a specific target group," says Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two young students here want to address as well as the elderly and all ages.
About Café-Liebhaber.
The friendly owner couple is behind the coffee-genus.
Enjoys the fragrant hot bread in the various variations itself.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is rather the expresso fan and Mirjam van of the place the Cappuccino drinker.
"To that, a baguette -- that's my thing," she betrays the NRZ.
Two events were already in the bright café.
I'd better say one thing.
Because the port festival took place outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ring night.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found it.
But not everyone's business.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is also not a prominent fan of Event evenings: "You can't do it all right now."
And with an event I always speak only to those who are interested in the special event.
This is why events will be the exception with us.
"We want to disrupt the very normal operation as little as possible."
Or, "Déjà Vu is also responsible for reliability."
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful environment at the stake in Kleve.
The road that develops more and more to a gastronomy enamel.
To the delight of many climbers, the guests from close and far and the students who discover the gastromiles and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A Day of Thanksgiving at MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Foundation Festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the club hall of the guest place "Witteborg" in Dinker, all enjoy the harmonious unity in the sign of the music.
Traditionally, the foundation feast is always the right festive to perform honors.
About the special award "Singer of the Year" this time, writer Rolf Wagener was pleased.
"You have not only written down a lot for us, but you have also turned around so many rounds for us, for our heartfelt gratitude," said the president of the Chores Erich Schlotmann.
This year's awards for participation in performances and choir samples were attended by the choir leader Dieter Schulze with 44 participants, followed by Honorary President Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and the last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants.
Place five placed note-warning Arthur Brückner.
A special thanks the board directed to the team of Verinswirtin Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again had a menu of the extra class and Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets with its regular choir samples every day at 7.45 p.m. in the club hall.
"New singing voices are welcome at any time," Schlotmann says.
UN announces new goals in the fight against poverty
The United Nations will begin immediately with the development of a series of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced 12 years ago for poverty reduction.
In front of the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the achievement of "sustainable development goals", which are expected to replace the Millennium Goals in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
Mr Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the UN, declared at the summit that the time had come to "think about national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to engage in a process to agree with the universal, sustainable development goals," he said.
"These objectives will be built on our progress in the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 framework for development.
I will not fail to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even if the SG Achim/Baden has been unbeatable for four days, the handball team still has a good mood.
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about it.
All are still fully motivated in the matter.
However, I hope that we will finally win again.
"Because I don't know how such a victory tastes anymore," Malmon expects a success from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the third-party reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet cut out trees, Malmon has in advance warned the sign finger.
I've trained many players myself in the A-youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex- coach.
"In addition, it should be expected whether there is further reinforcement from the first," explains the SG coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team has to increase in any case compared to the past performances.
In front of all things in the coverage work and in the switching game, it has recently opened powerfully.
The exploitation of opportunities must definitely be improved as well.
So I hope that my players have finally got their head off during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique increase due to conflicts between influential persons
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and the first president of Mozambique to agree to a rare public demonstration of peace.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment company.
In fear of the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes against a T-shirt with the title "We Request Security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday on the capital's independence seat.
For almost two weeks there have been reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, which have been among the worst fights since the Peace Agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement that was initially supported by the white Rhodesia and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilise the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 Peace Treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will return to a growing conflict, but the latest events have disturbed foreign investors and domestics.
For the fast-growing economy, much is at stake, as the discovery of huge gas flows from the coast and coal warehouses in the northwest could bring investments of over 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States in the coming years.
The ruling Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claimed that the government had provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala on 17 October, a traditional Hochburg Renamos.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated, as government troops attacked and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group leader, Renamos spokespersons against the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of having attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to raise concerns about instability.
Against AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama was considered a "loser" who "is willing to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can enforce his decisions".
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words, Renamo issued the 1992 Peace Agreement.
Against the FT, he explained that he felt that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously," Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have only contributed little to the tensions that have been caused by a number of clashes this year.
"We have two grown men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama), who will come together," says Joseph Hanlon, a professor at the Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good at trading, and none is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who insists on election reforms, has already explained that they will boycott municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to disrupt the government's commitment and financial benefits.
Renamos election successes have been shrinking since 1992, while a new party, founded by a former member of Renamo Democratique de Mozambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – his resignation, when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency," said Mazanga.
It is unclear which capacity Renamo has, but it has undertaken unrestful attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port, the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale used to export coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo had announced an attack on the track.
Mazanga answered the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted "the international community to warn that things in Mozambique are not good," Mazanga said.
The instability has increased frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, as many people have already taken care of themselves because of corruption, the progress that has been made in development and a recent recovery wave.
"People think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said people just wanted stability.
"None of you are interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace again and useful roads," he explained.
Children should get myths and legends added as "preamples for life", says one author.
Thor's stories showed that "brutal power has no chance against clever tricks", and the artus legends demonstrate how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, were "too wild, too violent and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools", therefore Crossley-Holland complained about a "careful selection" of old-fashioned works.
"I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for the past twenty years.
He added that, among authors and teachers who were "over-educated", children would "quit off completely", because in entertaining stories the messages would be "undeservable".
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the English language and was author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, said: "You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as much as possible."
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the Happy End, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be subversive, revealed by history and not explained.
That's the old story of the show instead of telling.
Hansjakob is once again in Freihof
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob visited his retirement home in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years were alive in the "Freihof".
Many spectators were thrilled by the extremely short play.
From the arrival of the granting of the honorary citizenship to his death, the spinbook author and Hansjabperper had designed a entertaining piece under the control of Cornelius Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as speakers with the ten different scenes, explained relationships and overstepped time from youth to approaching retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home in his children's sky, in his frigid.
And then the scene began, in which Alois Krafczyk shined more once in his parade than the great son of the city.
Stylicht introduced Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach with the twins and "Schwarzwälder Füchsen" with the "Schwarzwälder Füchsen".
He was not only welcomed by the audience with a lot of applause, but also his sister, Philippines, welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to move into the sister's role and gave her an unforgivable life in Mimik and Gestik.
The Mühlenbacher Farm Kapelle played selected pieces of music and thus rounded off the performance.
In order to grant the honor of the citizen, Haslachs Mayor Heinz Winkler was honored, who, in the presence of the then official Hattich, together with a part of the city council, made his hope.
Their expectations then led the Dreichönig-singer, who led Hansjakob to the call: "But how beautiful, there will again be youth training at my own Dreichönig time".
With their song "O Jesulein" they enjoyed the audience in the outdoors as well as the Storchentag children with their famous "Heraus, Out".
His criticism at the Church of State had at that time expressed his concerns about the growth of agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war.
In the homeyard, behind his tomb chapel on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his place of rest.
"A restless spirit had finally found its rest and had gone home forever," said it at the end of the stage.
There was a lot of applause and many praising words from the audience for the performance.
basketball: The hope of Neckar Giants grows
The chances of the remaining league of the sport-defeated Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball have increased.
Because there should be a Wildcard procedure, then there is now less a competitor for the Neckar Giants.
The basketball project Hamburg Towers ignores an application for a possible back seat.
"We are not going to participate in the Wildcard process," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been designing the concept for a professional club in Hansestadt since 2012.
A first blow was still not to be understood from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the Wildcard procedure, so long as it was not established that Düsseldorf does not receive a license," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Until 23 May, climber Düsseldorf Baskets may submit documents to the arbitration panel and demonstrate its economic integrity.
Until now, however, the Rhine countries have been denied the licence twice.
The divorce court is the last instance.
Haigerloch: The evening meal church falls into the point of view
As a contribution of the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city’s cultural and tourism office devotes the last of its public themes on Sunday, October 27, the evening meal church.
After the visit of the Atomic Keller Museum, the Haigerlocher was to be considered after 1850 when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The final point is a visit to the church in the evening meal.
There the leaders get the history of the building of the church and gain insight into the development of the evangelical community in one through and through the Catholic region.
Not least in the church is the view of the evening painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an orginal faithful reproduction of the famous Milanian model by Leonardo da Vinci.
The meeting point for the second half-hour guided tour is at 3 p.m. on the Atomic Keller Museum.
There are maps on the box of the Atomic Keller Museum.
For questions and information, the Tourist Office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also say in Russia
The former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum case.
Representatives of the Federal Attorney-General could either ask written questions or personally meet 30-year-olds in Russia.
This was reported by the Agency’s Interfax under a call to non-closely named circles that were familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be explained in an intergovernmental way, it was said.
A snow trip from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted her source.
Because Germany was US allies, threatened snowden there delivery, it continued
Longer Spirit Makes Pay
Six men's teams fought in the tennis tournament of the Associations for the title.
In the end, the duration of the Maier/Bronner team decided the last match.
A dream weather had received the tennis department of the sport friend Rohrdorf to the tournament of the local associations and friends.
The fun of tennis was in the foreground of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, each playing against each.
It was played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes duration.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament was in the best hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with Pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favorites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were scored with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of the SG Pipers), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
At the victory, Carmen Müller was finally able to pass the hiking pool to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
The second place was double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze stairs reached Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltriecher team.
At late afternoons and coffee and cakes, the successful sound of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend of August, the Schwarzwälder Freilichtmuseum Vogtsbauerhof in Gutach is still in children's hand.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, 24 and 25 August, as part of the summer holiday program, to a colorful children's and family party with numerous co-operations and events.
"Grand and small can learn different old crafts on two days," says the press release.
Whether to make soap, rotate candles, fillen or make ropes, for each age is the right thing to do.
The children are assisted by regional artisans from 11 a.m. to 17 p.m.
The museum workshop also works.
In the construction of cookies, water wheels or chairs, the young guests can demonstrate their handicrafts.
A lot of fun also promises the many old games, such as ski-carren race or race.
Speed and coordination are requested here.
For all small detectives, the Freelight Museum offers a tour of the Museum on Saturday and Sunday, each at 12 and 14 o'clock.
At a crossroads, children need to know what stories of the truth are or are still lying.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the outdoor museum during a short trip with Black Forest Füchsen.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens are to be found on the ground and to be cleansed.
In addition, all children can enjoy the Clown Otsch on Sunday, which runs its Schabernack from 11 a.m. to the museum guests.
At the same time, it goes to Hermann Büttner.
The storyteller takes the small guests around 11, 13 and 15 hours with them into the wonderful world of the fairies.
The children's dance group from Gutach will also perform traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
In addition, on two events days from 11 to 17 o'clock, numerous handicrafts such as the Besenbinder, the twin, the Spinner, the Weberer and the baker can be seen in their traditional work over the shoulder.
Even until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors of the Freilicht Museum expect a varied holiday program.
In a New Zealand city, Burt Muro is regarded as a loving caucus because he took part in a race in America with his motorcycle, the 1920s.
Burt is not to be removed from his dream in spite of a heart failure.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop sheds, he moves by ship to Los Angeles.
After the film there is coffee, tea and cookies.
Schrille's Pipsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships on the shelf.
The company has at its site several irons in the fire.
In addition to carbon imports, Rhenus Midgard places on windlass logistics among other things.
Black melts the coal on the storage site in front of you.
Two powerful blue hand-held and back-loaders distribute or download the coal here as required.
With each movement of the roundabouts, a shrill alarm sounds over the ground.
"The signals serve safety and are legally prescribed," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of the Rhine Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in the case of the unfavourable wind, there were already some complaints from people from the north of the city.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore made contact with the affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it is now possible to keep the warning signals below technical measures.
In the future, he will also sit on the open dialogue with the neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell has a few more in front of the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to place coal imports for power plants and is in this sector one of the largest in Europe.
Thanks to the 18.5 meters extension of the terminal, capesize-bulkcarrier can also be produced here for a long time.
"In this year we want to knock the 3 million-tonnes mark on the envelope," says Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, the import coal goes to power plants in the country.
If the GDF-Suez power plant is still on the grid, good 5 million tonnes of carbon imports per year are realistic.
The three shipowners on the bridge and the second transport band could create up to 10 million.
Bayerns basketballer despite first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not paint the huge optimism of the FC Bayern Munich basketball players.
"No one can forbid us to believe in winning the best team of Europe in the past two years," balanced Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening at the titled Defence Olympics Piraeus.
We sent the message: basketball exists in Munich too!
At their first third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichans sold themselves very well for a long time, but in the decisive stages were simply not clear enough.
The guests first managed to turn the art piece into a 15-point stand 13 minutes before the end, before Piraeus gave the game a turn again.
"We have fought back incredibly against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then again made slight mistakes," said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful broadcasters of the Munich, who had won a significant victory in the first two parties against the Italian serial champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish titler Zeilona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the Variety Artist Frank Fay, who worked as a lecturer at the Palace Theatre on Broadway to tell the lot of jokes in the form of a conversation.
In the course of the years Fays innovation was expanded, as was the latest at the New York Comedy Festival.
The festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters. It is the founder of Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the standing-up institution Carolines.
"Most of these heads started at Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were known to appear in a club," Hirsch said.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
At this year's event, there are events from Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as from "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual music and comedy charity event for army veterans in Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby take place.
With the festival, the world of Comedy has also grown.
A series of comedians participating this year at the festival have become more unconventional, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was introduced to a cable TV sitcom (the Ironic-Fantasy-Football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a part of the crew at "Saturday Night Live" as well as at "Parks and Recreation", although she is the most famous for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, race-focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the greatest visitors to the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a prominent television and film director as well as an informal comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he moderated a TV broadcast entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me when he's here, sometimes he goes through the gas between two buildings and thinks: hey, if I lose all my money, then maybe I live here.
Iran is satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran shows its satisfaction with the five UN and Germany negotiations a week before the next nuclear meeting.
"After years you now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to clear out the differences of the past years," Foreign Minister Mohammed Dschawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way to go, but the nuclear dealer was satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that at the end of the two sides would come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys Kill Game Cameras with Makete
Two children have committed the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys had invited her to go on a bird hunt with them.
With Macheten and knives armed, they surprised the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the corpse into a well, reported the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
Then they would have played in front of their apartments in a work district football.
The Leichnam was discovered in the following night in the town of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five - year - old half - year - old sister of the disciple she had taken said she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
But when the girl in front of the police described the tathering without a mention of an attack against them, the two boys committed the intentional murder of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elders called it a rivalry in the football game.
He was temporarily transferred to a psychiatric clinic.
Prisoner must be in prison
Due to exploitation of human trafficking, possession, threat, injury and dangerous bodily injury, the Landgericht Konstanz sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former German defence soldier, who worked as a doorkeeper after two visits to Afghanistan, filed a complaint during a trial hearing.
Thus, in five cases, he met women about Internet or telephone contacts that he sent to the strike after a few weeks against his will.
He maintained resistance to break with violence and threats.
He retained the income of the women who bought for him for some years.
By confiscating phones and SIM cards, he contacted women about the outside world.
Together with a colleague who communicated the women, he brought them to different brothels in the southwest.
There he partially monitored her to control her revenue.
The accused first claimed that he suffered from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had come to him in an explosion of life.
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about the psychological restriction and thus limited guilt, the 33-year-old left a comprehensive confession.
The Court no longer had to understand the injured women.
As reported by a Kripo official, at least four further cases of exploitation of human trafficking could be identified after a first announcement by telephone surveillance.
The ensuing talks were marked by high aggression.
In later admissions, the injured had confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, where one of the women had discovered blue spots all over the body, has not made a statement to date.
It is "a completely broken personality", the violence and exploitation in this metay is viewed as normal.
The defendant regretted his conduct yesterday.
"He got rid of these circles and wanted to lead a very normal life," he said.
The oil price continues to be up to 96 USD per barrel
The oil price was also dropped on Friday, after worrying about a high supply of a report, increasing the energy-efficient manufacturing sector in China.
The reference oil outlets for deliveries in December were dropped by 14 cents to USD 96.24 per barrel in electronic commerce in Europe at the New York Mercantile Exchange in the late morning.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a drop in price of 5.8% in October.
The large supply of crude oil has charged prices in the past few weeks.
The US Ministry of Energy announced on Wednesday that last week the US supply increased by 4.1 million barrels.
Over five weeks, the offer increased by 25 million barrels.
However, on Friday there was evidence of a stronger demand by two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese production.
This is reflected in the continued recovery of the Chinese economy, whose growth rose to 7.8% in the third quarter after it reached the lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Raw oil from the Brent variety, a reference value for international crude oil, also used by US refineries, fell at ICE Exchange in London at 26 cents to 108.58 USD per barrel.
Court Blocked Decision on the NYPD Stop-and-Frisk Directive
A U.S. Federal Appeals Court blocked the order of a judge on Thursday, who had demanded changes in the Stop-and-Frisk Program (“Keep and Search”) of the New York Police Department, and removed the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeal stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until a call was decided on the city.
The judge had decided in August that the city violated the Constitution in the manner in which the programme for the detention and questioning of persons was implemented.
The city called against its assessment and the planned decommissioning measures, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to support the police in amending their directive and the relevant training programme.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the suspension required.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be removed from the case as she had violated the Code of Conduct for US judges by stating that a judge should avoid the view of the party; this was partly based on a number of media interviews and public statements in which she had responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge had judged that police officers violated the rights of tens of thousands of people because they were unduly targeted by black and Latin American men with the stop-and-risk program in sight.
It appointed an external authority to monitor the implementation of major changes, including reforms in directives, training and service supervision, and organised a pilot programme with cameras carried out by the body in quarters where most controls were carried out.
In August, New York City declared itself ready to end the practice of storing names and addresses of persons released after a police check.
A oral debate on the occupation of the city is scheduled after 14 March 2014.
The Stop-and-Frisk tactics were criticised by a number of citizens' rights offenders.
Controls of this type have been in various forms for decades, but the number of controls recorded increased during the time of the partial mayor Michael Bloomberg at an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men, belonging to all minorities, filed complaints that developed into a collective complaint.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-risk programme say that the changes are going to end unfair practices and create a more reliable and effective police and influence the way other police presidents use the regime.
The opposite is the view that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime; money would also be wasted and the wider problem of a police, which has been under pressure since the passage of thousands of people in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not end the Stop-and-Frisk practice, which was constitutional, but only reforming the way the controls were implemented by NYPD.
From the luck of the dreaming camels
Good luck is an oasis that can only reach dreaming camels
With this concern, the first president, Wolfgang Henne, described the history and fascination of the association "Helping Hands".
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which can already have remarkable success.
The first president, Henne, reported in detail on the work of the association.
He himself was the first in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, another cooperation developed, and Gynecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on the spot on several trips.
During the talks, images were shown from the stakes on a large canvas wall, so that the guests of the anniversary event could make an image of the aforementioned actions.
The company's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former federal border guard vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed that this vehicle be equipped with a photovoltaic device and is now planning to become active at the association in advisory function, according to Henne.
In 2008, the Schleeh room from Baiersbronn in the record time of almost one week created the hospital in Socogim, a disaster district on the outskirts of the capital.
She also mentioned a new mother child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times in which the birth clinic is to be denationalized in Nagold.
You learn a lot in Africa as a medical practitioner, as hen, for example, acceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to undertake as many trips as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to hospital in various areas.
In addition, containers with materials are regularly sent to Africa, so in March of this year medical devices, medications, association materials, hospital beds and glasses.
Mitinitator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered a lot of local coloring by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles built on the mobile track and the experiences of the family musicians who traditionally supported the association on their Mauritanian journey.
As his personal motivation, he called his work in the field of auditing the accounts as a young deputy.
When it became clear to him how much money had been lost on the way, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, Fuchttel stressed that global economy also requires global human love.
It should also not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
Gran Canaria wasn't far from Africa.
Coulson set up phone hacking to check a tip
The previous news of the Word Editor Andy Coulson reportedly introduced "telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Public Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC explained to the Court in Old Bailey, News of the World in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive Special Adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned Private Detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's Voicemails, and persecuted them, but Coulson also called her and left news as the court heard.
“In the opinion of the Public Prosecutor, Coulson, now a NotW publisher, is no one who stands before people’s apartment and hopes to meet them in a fresh way, but one who is willing to face a story to see their reaction,” Edis explained.
He said that NotW uses three methods to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows from the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can not be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He argues about it, but we say, "And if he knew about it."
News about an affair Clarkes was first picked up by the feature editor of NotW, when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A band with voicemails from their phone for at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaires apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer, on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
At the time when the researchers lived, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: “I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, about which I want to talk to Charles.”
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as in other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The swearers heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had faced an affair with a married woman when he himself was engaged to the co-accused Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks argue to have sworn to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have added the phone hacking.
In protest against the planned tax, the French football will actually be the first strike since 1972.
A wedding meeting is unsuccessful.
In the conflict over the rich tax, the government and the professional football in France have maneuvered after a damaged match in a bag gas.
President François Hollande received their complaints on Thursday in Paris, Élysée-Palast.
However, he refused to release the football from the planned 75-percent payment of more than one million euros per year to all companies in the country for two years from 2014.
The opposite also remained hearty.
The strike announced at the end of November will also be taken through, the Chief Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, shared.
The games set up between 29 November and 2 December in the League 1 and the League 2 fall.
Things: No absolute protection possible
"We want to include the residents early in planning," Mayor Jens Häßler opened the citizens information event on the concept of high water protection in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants came to the community hall to explain the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to introduce ideas.
Hüßler made it clear: "The final decisions fall on the members of the municipality".
The high water, which was unprepared on 15 May 2009, was an intrusive event that raised the question of protection measures for the future, according to Häusßler.
A river basin survey was commissioned with the neighboring community Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the high water protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many cultivated plots as possible is the goal," says Häüßler.
The planning of protection against a German weather service is based on high water expected every 100 years.
Climate change is accounted for by a 15-percent increase.
This is described as "HQ 100aKlima" in sections.
The water masses, which caused significant damage in 2009 to gechines, corresponded to a 1000-year-old high water.
"There is no absolute protection, but a relative improvement can be achieved," said Häßler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aClimate, about four million euros must be invested in gechines, with the municipality with land grants of about 70 per cent.
However, Hüßler pointed out that there is only support if a general concept is implemented.
For this purpose, the Community shall be directed towards the involvement of the citizens.
An extensive planning and approval procedure should be completed.
In the best case, 2016 can be started with implementation.
Among other things, the concept of protection, which was presented in the municipality (we reported) last week, provides for local measures in response to the flood of Irm from the Stammheimer valley.
Following the presentation of the concept of high water protection, the participants took advantage of the opportunity to raise their concerns.
Among other things, it was asked why no more dams and reservoirs were planned to protect the site.
Gregor Kühn, the expert planner of the commissioned engineering office Wood and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that the interaction of all the measures presented is necessary to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, it is kept to find the most economical solution, as Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe.
Unfortunately, the people of the old town, who, even in normal winter rains, had to suffer again and again under an overload of the canal network.
The problem is known to the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
However, Hüßler pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems should be different from those for water protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to extend the channel network in such a way that two to three-year-old rainstorms can be exacerbated.
If the water channels were to be larger, millions would collapse.
Serious injuries after collision
On the early Friday afternoon, on the road 44 near Revensdorf, two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision.
The police immediately blocked the road completely, but could not say much about the accident.
However, there are various witnesses that should be assessed first.
The fact is that the 19-year-old driver of a VW golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf opposed her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles would be together, while the woman was so heavily stuck that the firefight took almost half an hour to free her from the vehicle wreck.
The actual cause of the accident remained unclear at first.
Both unfortunates came into nearby hospitals.
The route remained closed for about two hours.
He could be called Dostojewski, U.S.A.
Philip K. Dick was a searcher, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serious.
Fascinating the relationship in the outside: the piercing eyes, the bart, the high stars.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostojewski and his massive Oeuvre are to be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet, who applies something in his own country.
Some titles have appeared in the Heyne publisher, the Haffmans case with the 118 stories runs in the second millenniums.
Dick explains America - the realm of amazing technical progress, coupled with Paranoia, security waves and the faith, to be selected.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read like a mixture from the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, they put drugs in his brain.
He's got an early understanding that the computers are divine.
He wrote a computer theology and asked what a person differs from a machine, the Creator from his Creator.
That's the "Blade Runner" problem.
Kill it.
A Master of Science Fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors like Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The "Minorities Report" comes from 1956, it flows the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.
Here the principle of "pre-crime crime" is developed, "pre-crime", that is, what is in the meantime more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which scares us, they look at mutants in the future - and the police approach them.
"We record individuals who have not violated any law," says the Head of the Authority.
"We take them before they can commit a crime of violence."
And: "There are no serious criminals in our society, for which we have a criminal criminal who is full of personal criminals." You read the stream of time.
They assume that bad things happen, and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice.
Dick's story works like the blue break for the anti-terrorism laws and the exaggeration of the NSA.
Anticipation of the attack: Obama's Drone Philosophy and Practice also works.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no longer a division of violence, the military controls everyday - and what is left of the state.
Then the watchman himself will be guarded, and a future crime will be committed.
The system's going through.
It's perfect, but it's a lie.
It discovers its own requirements.
Not only does he take wrongs and victims for sale but he builds on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Philip K. Dick says to get closer to the truth all the time.
Talking about Merkel in Russia
The former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum case in the U.S. case about Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Court could either ask written questions or meet the 30-year-olds in Russia personally, the Agency reported the Interfax.
Previously, the Green-Bundagsagsagsender Hans-Christian Ströbele had met yesterday as the first German politician of Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
Enhancing NSA disclosures of companies paranoia due to state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police consulate flew deep over the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's capital.
At the request of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German Home Office, he should photograph the roof of the US external office, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to German media, BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a word exchange between the US and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
In September, James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, reiterated that the US did not use the possibility of foreign espionage "to steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US firms so that they could enhance their international competitiveness or their profits."
But since Edward Snowden, who became a single employee of Whistleblower, began publishing his full horn to US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer certain whether they can take the Director by word.
Reports on which the American National Security Agency is spying on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtained data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought company paranoia to a new peak due to state surveillance.
The passage to the crossing revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkels had been on the phone, perhaps for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can get to the visa, then it is certainly also possible for corporate leaders to reach potential goals.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between U.S. home and business transparent.
I believe that this data is likely to be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," explains Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the US now poses almost as high a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, such an inquiry published by the EY consultant company in July.
However, there has been no evidence in the documents provided by Snowden that the US has disclosed the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
The companies are skeptical about this.
The Federal Day was proposed, we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them...
“It doesn’t work that way,” says Hasso Plattner, president of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you should not have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal over cars to agriculture.
Everything up to the IT sector.
However, rich and technical refineries of the US spy authorities discovered by the snowflakes have shocked companies that had seen the largest spy risk in China.
There is a major change in cloud computing because European business leaders are now aware that data stored in the United States are subject to legal advice and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade agency, the US-American data mining activities revealed that about ten percent of the non-EU members had planned to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, the Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: “We see a new question of customers that hasn’t been there a year ago – it says: Where will my data be stored and you can guarantee that these remain physically in this courtroom?”
Many German corporate leaders represent the view that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore have to be watched at any price.
Economic espionage is not surprising.
It's always been like that.
"It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, chairman of the BASF chemical company.
The Americans are spying on us at a commercial and industrial level, just as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
The management usually does not care about the countermeasures that have been taken, because this gives attackers the advantage.
In large companies, employees have long been inspired to say that taking a free USB stick at a fair or the unguarded location of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a member of the board of directors of Autoproducer Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect the phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as hearing aids.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid hands when travelling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid hands are then discarded.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are world leaders in the respective niches.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorised access," the BVT warns in a report.
The US warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, in February, France, Russia and Israel were ranked two of the countries that served to obtain economic data from hacking, according to Washington Post.
A board member of a German blue-chip company agreed when it came to economic espionage, then "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French Home Service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: “The Secret Services know very well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies.”
Hechingen: Fair provides answer to wedding questions
"The marriage is the most important discovery that man can undertake," said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, as at least the wedding ceremony has succeeded, now gave a special show in the domain in Hechingen.
Representatives were important providers around a wedding.
One trend: The retro-look has been reintroduced.
This starts with the wedding dressers.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
Before they are often torn and covered with stickers, often with a slipper, on the other hand they go down their back and often end up in a trap.
However, the spirits are separated, as Stefanie Koch points out from the fashionable dresser.
In men, the suit is dominated by West and Plastron, but it can also be chosen cream coloured or brown combinations.
Importantly, the selection of the location has been explained.
Non-precious side rooms are not optimal, the environment should be special.
Here the domain paid attention to its own offer in the remise.
Whoever then wants to go ahead with the Kutsche, for which your link has an offer.
"But cookies are also popular for juvenile decisions," he says.
Romantics is also asked for invitation cards, flower arrangements and wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion come the "After-Welding-Photo" - i.e. series of recordings in special places, preferably such as waterfalls, some days after the festival, but in wedding dress, Elizabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangement, ring, wedding table, kitchen and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, the guest can entertain stylishly.
Don't forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable party.
Dog Friendly Success
For repeated times, the athletes of the dog friend bitz were successful on a rally-obedence tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Candel with two dogs; with his dog Sandy, he achieved 94 points in the class of beginners and secured the fifth place, and with the 15 months old Marley brought it with 87 points in place twelve.
Susi Höpp and her woody in Class 1 stood the critical views of the executive director.
Parents of a Georgian teenager who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a crowded ring mat in the tournament of his high school, are convinced that her son was murdered, explained the family's lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found in a well-established mat that stood behind the tribune in the school hall on 11 January.
The investigation officers of the Sheriff of Lowdes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but that the family of the 17-year-old was disappointed.
"They are convinced that her son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, against FoxNews.com.
They never believed he was dead as the sheriff had locked up.
"They are the view that every logic is in violation of the laws of physics and the human mind," said Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth will be confused to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school and came back in the body bag," he commented.
US Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday, there will be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, as a number of important questions are still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore explained that at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in which they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of a "position-related deterioration".
A second autopsy, however, has given rise to another cause of death, says Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added, if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he will instruct the FBI to carry out the investigations.
A representative of the county sheriff's authority was not immediately prepared to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in South Georgia arranged on Wednesday that the authorities should release all surveillance videos that the investigators have checked.
The parents of the teenager said they hoped that the video recordings would indicate how he died.
CDC publishes school allergy guidelines
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines on the treatment of food allergies in children in schools.
These are the first such directives issued by the U.S. government since the number of children with food allergies is increasing.
One of 20 children in the United States currently has a food allergy.
The distribution of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent, according to CDC between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information on schools that should raise awareness of food allergies in the body of teachers and employees and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine pre-existing – the auto-injection of the EpiPen brand is used most often – in order to meet a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
The legislators in the Federal States recently amended the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrine more easily available.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms called children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something is pressed on my tongue," "My tongue feels like a hair is on it" or "My tongue is chewing".
Parents of intersexual children can choose "uncertain sex"
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognized for children who were born with unexplained genitalia.
New births are no longer granted to men or women.
According to the new law, parents no longer have to explain sex to such children, but they can indicate "undefined" or "not specified" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to make the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make over decisions in relation to operations for the purpose of gender allocation in newborns and to combat the discrimination of intersexual people.
According to BBC years later, an intersexual person said, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I remain the girlwork created by doctors, confused and full of jokes.
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children comes to the world every year neither as a boy nor as a girl.
They are part of the intersexual group, a group that falls under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective concept for people with atypical chromosomes, chemistries (ovaries or heads) or unusually developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not well developed, but most experts in the United States advise that the best available information on gender allocation should be used, if a destination is not possible, and not wait for the child's psychological and physical development, before, if at all, deciding for an operation.
The New York Psychiater Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law "sling for a good thing".
Intersexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
"Many people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but most children do not," he said.
You can do a sex assignment without surgery and then wait for how the identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops its sexual identity is not very accurate.
No one knows why it's happening.
It's like the secret, which is why people are gay.
In a 2011 report to the European Commission, intersexual persons are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender persons, because their status is not sexual, but is conditioned by their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both simultaneously or clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were shown in the following sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, behaviour, breasts and stamina, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination suffered by intersexual and transgender persons in working life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Not compatible with the gender picture boys now have a special camp.
In the meantime, it is possible in Australia and Nepal for adults to indicate male, female or "third sex" on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "free" person after a court had granted the lifelong maintenance of a "unestablished" gender status.
In addition to M and W, German exhibits have a third allocation, X for intersexual, so the Ministry of the Interior.
In the neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, so a message to France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French MPs of the strict Catholic country signed a petition that the "sex theory" should be removed from school books.
The U.S. Catholic Online also expressed its opposition to the German law, on the grounds: “If the world is shaken into a new state, where sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we reverse two further pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone, she found it better if babies were assigned a gender at birth.
“The parent’s mind is also stressed enough without any further restrictions, especially if you don’t know the sex of your own child,” she said to the parent’s website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genders were named as hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek God who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, the doctor considered the sex to be something to be deleted and then to be able to rebuild.
In the meantime, however, the ethical foundations of an operation are disappointed after it is now known how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors can also lie wrong because they do not know how the child feels when he grows up with the sex that they are assigned to him.
“In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a “psychiatric emergency”, Drescher said.
When such a child was born, you don't call the psychiatrist, you call the surgeon.
The ruling theory of the treatment of children with non-explained genitalia goes back to Dr. John Money from John's Hopkins University, which presents the view that the sex can be formed.
He highlighted the term “sexual identity” and argued, social and environmental attacks – how parents raise a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and whether a person considered himself male or female.
However, in a case known as "John/John" from 1966, his theories became controversial.
He drives a boy's parents, whose penis was separated from him when he was stabbed, to cast the child completely and also to remove his head and then to raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a change, but it was not," Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.
But at 38 he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the introduction of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations have become public, which are "not happy with the result".
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana who was born with XY-man chromosomes, but two-way genitalia.
The doctors were not aware whether he had a great clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and his head were surgically removed shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD by which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After having learned the truth, he returned to the male identity, received testosterone injections and allowed his breasts to be removed.
It has become fruitless through the operation.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project to make intersexual people regarded as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the legal group Advocates for Informed Choice in California, ensures that the German law can "encourage stamping and stigmatizing".
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign a ‘not set’ to the child,” she explained.
We fear that will benefit from interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still don't know how the law will work, so we can just speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supported the Australian law, because it allows adults to be recognized as a third sex.
"Adolescents should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she said.
The German law deals with the allocation at birth.
This is not a fight to which little children should be forced at this time.
When they are grown up, they can decide for themselves about their body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast-feeding doctor from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law "authorised" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no egg stick.
Today Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in child psychiatry.
Although infertile, however, she hopes to be able to have a child through adoption or a mother.
"The law gives parents space, so they don't have to make decisions too quickly," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do various tests and clarify things and gives them such time before they write "male" or "female".
In this way everything is fine – you draw the child big and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parental happiness.
And you don't have to do an operation that can't go back.
"This puts the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are moving because they think they would not do the right thing," she explained.
Finally, the child decides on the sex that best suits him – and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make their own decisions.
Unknown girl injured by car shots
Unknown ones have injured a 12-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt in shots from a car.
On Thursday evening, the perpetrators had probably fired a group of children with an air pressure gun in Genthin.
This was shared by the police in Burg.
The girl was slightly injured in the left van.
Rescue forces brought the girl to the hospital.
The gun came from a small car that was passing by on a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The workers also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they drove away.
The criminal police found out, it was called on Friday.
So far, the police inspection can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only called twice to ovaries, which they cast against domestic plants.
Since the houseowners recognized this in time and the egg residues were removed immediately, there should also be no damage to the plant.
After all, some Sylvester bubbles were also burned in the city area, but also here no damage has occurred.
A resident in the Bishop-Freundorfer road reported that his Pkw was incorporated with a piece of paper and his radar blanks were removed.
Until the police arrived, however, the man had discovered his radar blinds in close proximity all the time, so the police did not have to continue working.
Housing with a view to the future
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives in a dream.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of green, an old tree stock, nice neighbours and not much traffic.
In the city there are only a few minutes of public transport.
"Do you hope they're not afraid of spins?" asks Waltraud Ries and shows up on a fat spin on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for a while.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
However, the reason is not spinnenphobia, but the concern, at age, that many steps to the house and the apartment can no longer be handled, explains it.
In addition: Since a Menikus operation, the mid-five-years have had to learn on their own body what it means to move with a handicap from stockwork to stockwork.
Recently, a book from her appeared on the topic 'Happyly living in the age - What form of living is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not going on at age', she begins to tell.
When she and her husband moved to the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, in mid-50, Waltraud Ries thinks otherwise.
She also knows that she belongs to the few people who are at all involved with the theme 'Living in the Age'.
Most people push it as long as it goes.
They'll always be just the others', she says smug.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great can you think about it.
'But it can be too late, too,' says Ries.
In her book, the interior architect presents 17 living models for a self-defined living room in the old age.
'What form of living you choose is always an individual decision', she explains.
D i e solution does not exist for the age.
Even those who can afford the retirement age in Tuscany or Brittany should always assume that they can also become ill.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the language of the country, you also join in the Dolce Vita,' the expert book author gives you an idea of residence.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative forms of housing or the often cited pensioner WG.
At the age of everyone has his ticks and hooks
'But it would be nothing to me,' she says with an eyebrows.
Not as much as in a student WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'At age you just need his retreats', as Ries said.
However, the author does not want to exclude the fact that a senior resident community can still operate.
But that would have to happen differently than in the classic WG.
And sometimes you just want his rest, she thinks.
In this opinion, at least it is not alone in the capital of the country.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment for so long,' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service life at the age of the capital.
Its service advises people about the topic 'Be older'.
Therefore, even older people would often also purchase inconveniences and restrictions just to be able to stay in their usual surroundings, which is also the experience of the Warentest Foundation.
Today there are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that all those who deal with the old-fashioned reconstruction of their home or home should first be informed thoroughly and not be entrusted with the best craftsman.
Today there are also for the old-fashioned conversion specialists.
Even in the apartment, it is possible to realize one or the other, and if it is only the toilet lift, the interior architecture clears up.
But the existing apartment can not always be redesigned properly and thus accessible, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to be done by Waltraud Ries.
Even if you could install a stairs lift inside the apartment, which would also be a much larger obstacle to the door of the apartment.
She will continue until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move, she is more pregnant than before the spider at her apartment door.
USA wants to continue to prosecute Snowden
The United States has not changed its attitude towards the former U.S. Home Affairs Officer Edward Snowden.
It will continue to be proposed that secret information should not be disclosed.
Therefore, he had to put himself in a criminal procedure in the United States, the spokesman of the US Foreign Ministry, Jennifer Psaki, said in Washington.
Nor would the recent expressions of snowmen change anything.
Previously, the German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the United States after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, not to threaten him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that in the case of strike statements, it is the case of a parliamentarian and not of a German member of the government.
Secret Service Thüller Edward Snowden is basically ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation clearly.
This was made clear by the former NSA staff sought by the United States in a non-addressed letter published by Green politician Hans-Christian Ströblee on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, the Federal Day and the Federal Attorney General.
The following words shall be inserted after a translation of the letter:
To the competent authorities
I was asked to write you about your investigation for mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously engaged in a contract or a direct appointment as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I have witnessed systematic violations of the laws of my government, which have compelled me to act morally.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a heavy and persistent heat that forced me to leave my family and home.
I am now living in exile and enjoying the long-term asylum that the Russian Federation grants me under international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance on my political actions, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens all over the world and also high officials - including the United States - have assessed the revelations into a system of comprehensive monitoring that is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations made many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public confidence.
The benefits for the society from these findings are becoming more and more clear; at the same time, the risks incurred have been reduced visually.
Although the result of my efforts has proved positive, my Government still treats this as a breach of trust and then seeks to criminalise and accuse political opinion.
Nevertheless, to speak the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the Government of the United States, with the support of the international community, will reject this depressing attitude.
I hope that, if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are involved, I will be able to participate in the full accountability of the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, in good faith and in accordance with the law.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation has been clarified and thank you for your efforts to preserve international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testified by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Children's Gardens Found a Private Buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Mayor Michael Maier of Winterlingen.
The former kindergarten in the garden street sold the municipality to a private person.
The municipality agreed to the sale at its last meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner to a "announced" price.
"The community is satisfied," says Maier.
The budget was set at EUR 100 000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over the responsibility for the building before winter to someone else and thus no longer has to appear for the entertainment of the house, how to heat up, look at the garden, and take the path.
"This effort is now gone," Maier rejoices.
Place concert at high temperature
The Musikverein Hammreisenbach offers a place concert on the terrace of the Hammer guesthouse.
When conductor Bianca Willmann has the tackstock at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
Some 50 listeners are happy with the sounds of Hammricher musicians.
The chairman Manuela Honeck explains the music.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped successfully manage the first music hockey.
Report: Obama's campaign considered replacing prayers by Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisors have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign by Hillary Clinton, as the New York Times.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long-awaited work on the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times provided a copy of the book that was soon to be published, and she reported on Thursday evening that the president's top advisors had conducted "wide group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011" to find out if Obama's hope of re-election would be better if he let the bees fall.
According to Jonathan Martin, a national political correspondent of the Times, the book fundamentally shows the history of the efforts of leading employees of the campaign and the White House to measure, notably the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, the effect it has on the survey values that former Foreign Minister Clinton had on the vice presidents.
The potential change was a strictly protected secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisers – including Daley, former campaign leader Obama, Jim Messina, and former White House leaders David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the proposed change.
“Double down” is claimed to have stood at the top of the efforts to exchange prayers despite their “strong, personal relationship” before a decision was finally taken against such a move, after the data showed that Clinton’s candidacy “would not significantly improve Obama’s chances”.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually decided to replace biden by Clinton.
"I said a whole series of things that should be considered, and that was one of them," Daley explained to the magazine.
It must be remembered that the President had terrible surveys at the time, so we thought, "God's will, what are we doing?"
While Daley described the studies as "supply care", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that during the campaign for re-election, considerable effort had been made to determine whether such a train would pay for the election hours.
"In campaigns, not so much money will be spent on surveys and focus groups if you don't think about something seriously," Martin told AC360.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin said to CNN, he asked Daley if his then boss knew about the potential change of decision.
Although Daley explained that he did not believe that the President of the possible change was "conscious", the former chief of staff admitted that it was "possible" that Obama had known about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question whether the political polls had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama didn't know anything about the investigations about whether to let biden fall in the election.
"Possible," said Martin.
What's going on with my e-mail?
E-mail is actually an e-mail.
Did e-mail be technically implemented in the design of the Internet service as in the original mail?
The concept of early Internet services was primarily designed to make communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols did not take into account the need to create a stable basis for a more responsive exchange of letters.
Therefore, a common e-mail corresponds rather to an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If the user "Anna" sends a mail to "Benni", are the computers of the two then connected directly?
The Anna's e-mail program or browser sends the mail to the mail server of her service provider in the first step.
For example, if she has a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider used by Benni.
On the route, the mail can run over several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Will regular e-mails be read on their way through the network?
Most mails are read several times by software robots.
In the case of the sender's provider, the mail is usually checked for any damage caused by the mail as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers will check whether it is a malicious and unwanted spam mail that is deleted or at least sorted into a spam folder.
Do the robots still have another job?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also detects the information Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benny communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can include corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails with?
The probability that unauthorized people read a mail is extremely low.
Theoretically, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read e-mail.
The prosecution authorities and secret services also have legal possibilities to capture e-mails or to get to know.
This will include possible illegal expulsion actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from reading?
With an encryption based on the OpenPGP standard, an email can be encrypted effectively against readers.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to obscure the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even possible to recognize who has communicated with it without further recognition.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
Yahoo and Google, according to a survey of Convios Consulting from August 2013, play only a subordinate role in the mail sector.
While the shares of Yahoo-Mail were recently lost, GMail was able to make a significant contribution from Google.
Mother in the forest tightened and paid rent
When his beloved mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and still paid their rent and maintenance money.
In order to continue paying rent and maintenance money, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after police investigations in the forest.
First he changed the death of 89-year-olds, then he narrowed the money for more than half a year.
Now the 67-year-old has to be responsible for fraud, as one speaker said on Friday.
Then the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: At that time he realized that no medication was needed for the mother in need.
The investigator told the tenant that his mother was traveling to Spain.
Because the officials were curious about this, they went on to figure out.
It came to the conclusion that for more than 15 years, the two had lived in a common home and he had managed them last.
The 67-year-old finally admitted his mother's death.
According to the police, there were no points of reference for a capital offence.
Do you like ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur developed the first ice glowing in the dark – with the help of quails.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the marine creatures and created a glowing beauty.
The idea came to him after he had read a research work on quails and could convince Chinese scientists to produce the shiny protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts when consumed with the tongue, thereby raising the pH in the protein and triggering the light.
Chris explains that the diet reacts to the heat in the mouth and shines – the more you smell, the more it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and two grams of it is obtained for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
If the mouth warms the protein, the pH rises and the ice shines.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the quail light material is four times more expensive than gold.
Every ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But for that, it tastes good.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation will be even more ambitious.
He says: "I want to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is on and for itself impossible because of the light breach caused by the ice crystals, which consists of ice cream; but I suspect we will find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a whale that are artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the handball league after six days of play.
It is now calculated for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season begins again for us.
"I hope we finally have the head free," Ehlers behaves optimisticly.
He finally has, with the exception of the permanent injured Henry Blohme, his complete frame available.
Daverden's on a tempo game, too.
That is why we need to keep our error rate low.
First of all, however, there is an increase in coverage, which has recently left everything other than a safe impression.
Much more relaxed is Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz after the first season victory against the North Horn.
The game was of course a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite for a long time, because in Derby everything can always happen.
At the same time, Panitz wants to stay in Morsum to start a series.
Missing Jan-Malte Jodat.
For this, the A-Youth Joost Windsuit, which is active in the A-Youth-Fundesligist HC Bremen, celebrates its seasonal debut.
Whoever's not hot in such a game is supposed to stay home.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late and dress for the neighborhood.
Today I've become a Halloween muffler.
In the last two years, I have not explained myself willing to distribute from my apartment out of sweetness, and it will probably not be done this year.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of 6.9 billion US dollars for sweets, costumes and decorations, such as the U.S. Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween, then again, is the trend values.
The costumes will amount to about 1.2 billion US dollars spent on 6.9 billion, so the NRF.
This year are exciting unbelievable items of the last step.
Women no longer need to wear sexy clothes, they can now also consume seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect every amount of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I rule that the Daphne-Punk-World Dreams will make it into Instagram feed this year.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess it's nothing wrong with tradition.
Last year, we dressed our dogs, so we weren't alone with my surprise.
In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year for the costumes of their pets, so the NRF.
These are a lot of "Hot Dogs".
As for sweets, we're not shy.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, says The Nielsen Company.
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate gels, liqueurs, beans and gum beans.
So good news for the U.S. Department of Commerce, 41 million people, with the word "sweet or sades" coming through the neighborhood.
In fact, we're going to buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we're not going to eat anything.
The only thing we don't want to consume is Candy Corn's sweet, yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, so the National Association of Sweets Manufacturers.
These are about nine billion corn grains.
It's a puzzle I couldn't solve yet.
There's nothing more to Halloween than houses where it smells.
They have great names such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Screen" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized spy houses in the United States that earn 500 million dollars, says America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you just tap into your pants and then put the friends on Facebook where you don't get rid of them again, and then one of the type on which you're standing leaves a comment like "net face-to-face."
But let's finally get to the dolls.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great Crow when we were children, and the cutting of a cube is like the decoration of Christmas tree – something we have made from small.
Luckily, the baby in the Kürbis trend began last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have grown up to correct the Kürbis and not to sit in it.
This year Americans will spend about 106 million dollars on sausages, so the US Census Bureau.
The cubes, which slowly rotted in the front garden, are probably from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of cubes have been carved this year.
If you want to score correctly, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and cut some pretty hair from their 921 kilos of heavy beads.
Apartment fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue forces mountains sold bodies
The firearm had to express itself in Helmbrechts on the late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof starts at night for Friday fire.
The rescue forces mount a stolen body out of the house.
Rescue forces found in a fire in Helmbrechts a stolen body in a three-family house.
Whether it's a resident is still unclear, as a police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
On the late Thursday evening, it was burned at the ground floor of the house.
When the firearm came in, the flames were already blowing out of a window.
The operatives went to the apartment and found the body in a room.
This room and another room were completely burned out.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman continued.
First, the building is no longer habitable.
The exact reason for the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest land church has launched an offensive to recruit for the profession of the pastor.
The Evangelical-Lutherian Church of Hanover is counting on the number of some 1,800 pastors and pastors at present to be halfed by 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) said in conversation with the Evangelist Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and day-to-day cycle itself.
With Burfien, the Church has for the first time commissioned a pastor in a full place to entertain young people for theology study.
At present, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after the Abitur.
Burfien brings this back to the process of the Church Church: "God's voice is silent, the world is loud".
The profession was marked by great freedom and diversity.
I am the Lord of my timetable and can put my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors could be a soul caretaker very close to humans.
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well of it.
There will certainly be more paid in the free economy, but theologians would have been a safe employer.
This is against young people from today, not just about careers, but about a job that is full of meaning.
According to the Church of the Land, which includes three quarters of the Netherlands, about 60 pastors go to rest each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicariat.
In densely populated areas such as Harz, Emsland or Wendland, it may be difficult to occupy places in the future.
Burfien, among other things, wants to organize study days for young people and also invite prominent people who have studied theology.
Theology study provides extensive training.
You can even become the president of the Federal Republic of Germany.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are race seats and six-point belts as well as a free presentation facility.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with the support of Bowler-Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced runners, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as an accessible way to world-class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various Rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and prepare new people for Rally Raid's traps and reality.
We were really happy to develop the Defender Challenge Roads – this will be an entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and test day for the Defender Challenge in February as well as the option to take part in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firearm for the rescue of a handcuff, which placed 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock run in a stone break
Cockerspaniel-Hundin Ruby was hit by a smaller traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in a stone break in her bad position
Firemen flocked to the rock wall and saved the dog from the safe death
The firearm was able to secure a handle that was fixed on a 15-metre high lead in a rock wall.
The nine months old cockerspian dog Ruby was killed after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived alone for three days before she was rescued from a stone breach on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 of whom the dog belongs, came to the rock break Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to receive Ruby again and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They were desperate to search for their missing dog and to publish relief services in social networks when it was due to the small traffic accident in the stone breach.
At about 14:15 a.m. on Wednesday, a walker saw his dog, the beached Ruby on the 15-metre high section of the stone.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station drove to the scene and set off for the rescue of Rubys, which was then transported in a dogbox upstairs.
Andy Clayton, a technical rescue team specialist, said: “She was in a dangerous position.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was like frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then asked for a few dogs.
That was a pretty unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a huge fortune."
There was the possibility that she was very badly injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinarian for examination, but he did not find anything but exhalation and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "To see the salvation was scary."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her in her arms again.
The veterinarian explained that if the invention had become too big and it would have been broken, it would probably have been crushed.
The firefighters have done great.
It was really brave what they had done.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely unbelievable.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid that she would fall, but she stayed upstairs."
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger said he never made Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio broadcaster this week, the pop star said she worked as a background singer at Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry explained that she had eaten with the altrocker at night, and that “he had betrayed me when I was 18”.
She added: "It's been a long time, and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he "categorically denies that he has ever made an attempt to approach Katy Perry".
The representative added: “Perhaps she has confused him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" landed on anheeb on place 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European Distortion Gives the Shot the Choice
A new day, a new story of fear of independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is necessary to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the password for stories about passport checks in Berwick and a border secured with stacked hair along the Hadrian Wall.
In fact, the Strathclyde proposal pointed to the possible economic advantages that would bring more freedom of travel to the rest of Europe, but this, hopefully, did not play a role in the battle lines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU Member States often apply their strict rules if it is more favourable to them.
Since Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen area, the continued non-compliance for Brussels would be only a small concession in contrast to what you really want from the Scottish people.
So it's not really a story.
And one that has come so far in the years that it already resembles a fossil: for the first time, I have heard the "independence means passport checks" entity at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story.
Why should an independent Scotland expect it to dance according to the European pipe?
Why does the London Joch trade against that of Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan for the unification of Europe, which has been set up since the war, has come to the fore.
The euro crisis officially killed the project Europe.
Everywhere in the EU, EU-friendly parties win or want to throw the euro overboard as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic Party Alternative for Germany – founded only this year – was able to raise almost five million votes in the Federal elections in September and effectively distribute the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Federal Day.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is a turning point.
Because of the strict savings policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in conjunction with the mandatory jacket in which the national economy is required by the maintenance of the single currency, many people feel that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – this was only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has set its members at exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to do.
Without the possibility of devalued local currency, South Europe will again find itself with an integrated productivity advantage against Germany.
The only option is to reduce wages and public expenditure – driven by Berlin.
Behind the current state and currency problems is a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the "green" energy directives, which were prescribed by Brussels – a code for the subsidisation of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays double for electricity and four times for gas compared with the United States.
This is a loathsome cost advantage, as we could see in Grangemouth already.
All of the world's wage records do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being forced into the corner by cheap American skiing gas.
As a result, a revolt is taking place, especially in France, the EU's independent cheerleader.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle with which to keep Germany in check and raise Paris to eye heights with Washington.
However, Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and Europe has expressed its own economic policy, which has to fight the affected French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pens, the EU-enemie Front National, has just won a decisive reelection and thus the ruling socialists refer to three.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of voters – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot get out of it, a division in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits to the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly won popularity among the white French of the working class?
It wants to use the EU waves next year to avoid an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties cut out well in these elections – and this is very good – then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point that I would like to make: in the near future, the growing referendum against the EU and the common currency will meet for the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become something more like the "Europe of the (super-) nations" that favoured General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may remain in the euro, but France and South Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of joining the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific is pointing to the fact that Britain will be alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where does Scotland stay with all that?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including Berlin and Brussels, what they can find.
I suspect that Scotland could be doing quite well in a more loose European union if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of the nations.
Otherwise, we should consider keeping Norway equal and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – notably – the most successful political movement against savings policy in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and undertaken) cuts that the Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Lib Dem coalition had to take.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide now for independence, only to be forced to have a savings policy from Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: grow faster
African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age families, as research shows.
Physical changes do not yet directly mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced among boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother care if her daughter grows up at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Association in Orlando, Florida, the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time calming my parents – usually it's not a sign that puberty is coming in fast," Kaplowitz explained.
The obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, sham and axel hair, as well as body noise, are shown earlier in girls.
However, there was only a slight shift in the age of Menarche (the appearance of the first rule bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, somewhat less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When breast development begins, it lasts for at least two to three years to Menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Fresh Puberty in Girls: The Essential Counselor to Deal With This Common Problem".
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is disputed what actually constitutes the beginning of puberty, but it is 'early' if the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth gap before an eight-year-old age.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a child doctor can monitor.
With faster progress, tests could be shown by an endicronologist so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded.
There are methods of treatment to delay early menstrual periods and to prevent other consequences: the early age of bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are oriented at the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and the emotional maturity.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is persistent about drugs, but he argues: “Prepressing puberty can soften the behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, other than their peers.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They take care of the risk of pregnancy or how they maintain the hygiene side," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," remembers a woman whose daughter received ten days.
Even though there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came scared and excited from school home because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be justified.
Boys come to puberty like girls before.
Kaplowitz is the view that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a study on girls aged between six and nine in 2001 that creates a relationship between body fat and the admission to puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Overall, early puberty seems to be influenced by all possible things, from economic conditions over the climate to genes.
Another challenge: While boys are already growing facial and ashamed, the trend towards a full-fledged early puberty is not as marked as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference stress the complexity of the topic.
The emergence of acne and shamaar is spread even among babies and infants.
"We must be careful how to identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to consult their child’s doctor as they should speak to their child.
“This may mean that you have to conduct a conversation earlier than expected”, Riet Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it enters earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers dispute in the face of large orders over seat width
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a dispute over the width of seats in the tourist class in long-distance flights, indicating the tone for a bitter collision at Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seating width offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who make the most of their efforts, but this demonstrated space represents the key to the efficiency claims of the latest aircraft of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co..
Airbus requested this week a industry standard that requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the US Erzrivale Boeing said that the airlines should decide.
The dispute comes at a time when the aircraftbuilders are betting to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-range aircraft, and are expected to hold record orders from 17 to 21 November.
As the rear part of the aircraft is designed – in particular, whether there are rows of nine or ten seats – it is crucial for the stated economic results to deliver the new mini-jumbo design.
Boeing claims to have its modernized "777X" range of 406 people sitting in the tourist class who are over 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transporter 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often share hives about technical details through advertising in the press.
Airbus now calls in front of Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to run directly to the public.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war and showed donors a picture in which three people were seated together in a restaurant, and the title: "Would you accept it?"
"Boeing proposes long-distance flights in seats that are narrower than regional turbo-props," says Airbus Sales Manager John Leahy.
In the face of changed eating habits, people become thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance journey, and by the end of the century, the weight of the male average American has increased by 10 percent between 40 and 49 years, so the data of the US Ministry of Health.
The size of the average American male in the 21st century is 100.8 cm according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says that his rival held a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average body size of the newly baptized "Jet Set" was narrower.
Airbus has been carried out investigations that have shown that an additional duty (2.54 cm) per seat increases the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing argues with Airbus figures to the level of seats and says that it is not up to the manufacturers to decide how airlines balance air fares with the institution.
The company also explains that according to studies, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
“It is really going to give airlines flexibility so that they can do what they need to do in order to be successful,” explains Flight Cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
You know her business better than anyone else.
For passengers, there is more flexibility for elbows, but for manufacturers there will be a growing issue that can affect sales.
Behind the controversy is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion US dollars at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the US or Europe's export balance.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the conflict around the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claimed 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-range design than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
The statements Boeings to the results partly depend on that the 777X with its ten seats per row is compared to the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than the machines currently used with ten seats per row.
“Boeing therefore has more seats in its aircraft to make it more competitive for our products,” says Kevin Kenston, head of passenger comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row in the existing 777s, pointed out that many passengers decided for the closer arrangement, which could result from cheaper air fares.
"The eighteen-inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat by the 777," says Mary Kirby, expert in cabin facilities, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world-wide Jet sellers even wear band sizes to measure the installation in competition.
Even if they offer the comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-density design for cheap flights and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with tens of rows, but has not yet sold, according to its own statement.
Up to now Airbus has emphasized how important the adaptability of the cabins is and for some jets wide seats on the corridors.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call will probably be rebuffed to a new industry standard, but could deviate from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotin vaccine could make the garage more enjoyable when smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotin vaccine that could destroy the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice for a long time from choking.
In the face of tests on humans, further tests are needed, which may take a few more years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from the Well Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tried all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that their nicotine search is stronger than these approaches”, said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells that then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, so a smoker does not experience a nicotine high.
In trials, a vaccineed mouse with nicotine was given to her normal level of activity.
On the other hand, mice without vaccination had taken a "time off", the researchers explained a sign that the nicotine had reached its brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Earlier tobacco vaccines failed because they included antibodies.
The vaccines had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical.
However, the costs of the new vaccine are likely to be significantly lower, as it converts liver cells into antibodies.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for people could, if he is sure, be given to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine.
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop it.
"They then know: If they start smoking again, they no longer feel satisfied because of the nicotine vaccine, and this helps them to remove the habit," he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi argues to be influenced by Obeid
Against the former Minister of Labor Party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, an investigation is initiated by State corruption surveillance.
The former NSW Minister argues that the regulations on maritime pollution have changed at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who has held hidden participations in three land areas in a state controlled country.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) expanded its investigations into whether Obeid had influenced various government ministers to extend contracts at the Circular Quay, where the Obeis operated two restaurants and a café without a call after their departure in August 2005.
Now, due to the charge, Tripodi has been aware of Obed's hidden interest in the plots after Tripodis had previously represented Chief Officer Lynne Ashpole on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had insisted on public tenders for contracts.
The bakers were on the other side and wanted longer periods of time.
In 2009, contracts for the companies at the Circular Quay, which offered the Obeds $2.5 million annually, were extended without a public tender.
Tripodi, who served as Minister of the Harbours from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally voted for public tenders.
However, he objected to having made the changes to requests by Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had forced the reform of the government's rules of procedure.
One of the IAC's telephone signatures showed talks from August to September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a leading officer who was transferred to the Ministry of Harbour after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
"Where is the topic discussed in this telephone discussion the development of commercial sanctions?" asked the representative Commissioner Anthony Wheely Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli warplanes reach destination in Syria, so official sources
Israeli hunting aircraft had attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday, confirming a leading government employee against Fox News.
The officer did not explain what the goal was, but said it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, it was the goal of the Russian SA-125 rockets.
At least twice this year, Israel has already launched air strikes on missile supplies in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457-visa could be subjected to "Truth test"
In the context of the extended measures, the Government is thinking of a 'reality test' for foreign workers with 457 visas.
If the test is introduced, it will use a criterion to prevent 457 from being used to recruit unqualified jobs or as a back door for family and friends to go to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was published after the previous MEPs of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be taken up by the neighbours of Australia as an insult.
“Sound statements such as “foreigns are supposed to be in the back” and “Australian first” are a very unpleasant return in times when trade unions called for a protected labour market,” she told Australia India Institute today.
Historically, it was said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region were to ruin an echo of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The proposal for a debate covers twelve measures that were once addressed by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was talking yesterday about human smuggling in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still under consideration.
If the ‘reliance criterion’ is taken over, then someone who applies for a visa could be examined as to whether ‘the application is true in cases where the applicant is related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting undertaking’.
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 Vissum holders after, in the past, companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers, finally set aside hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asymptomatic died on a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island this week with a refugee boat.
The broken nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him has been cared for by an adult cousin since his father's death on Wednesday, who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The UK government announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to make high-speed connections between Scotland and Northern England at the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project "will bring Britain closer".
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown explained that he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between London and the West Midlands.
After phase 2 is completed, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government adjusted the estimated costs for the construction of the high-speed road between London and Northern England from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to seek further road capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel period of at least three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network bringing Britain and its cities closer together."
We go ahead with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits with it.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is a good news for Scotland."
In the name of the Scottish government, Keith Brown Carmichael called for "unintelligible" for the Scottish involvement in the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail connection is the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time the economic power of Scotland also provides an argument for fast rail connections across the UK."
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British government and to explore the options for a high-speed rail connection in Scotland, create the benefits for all and complement the connection Glasgow-Edinburgh, which the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the investigation report with the British ministers next year and jointly deciding the next steps.
Regulations on electronic devices in aircraft remain in force temporarily in Australia
Australian air passengers must also continue to turn off tablets and smartphones at start-up and landing, despite efforts in the United States to block the regulations for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) enables US airlines to change their defaults so that passengers can read, see or play videos on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in "flight mode".
While most of the flight is already allowed to fly this, many people find it annoying that they should not read their e-books when starting and landing.
However, Australian companies are not following any immediate plans to amend their rules.
The CASA Aviation Insurance Authority also stated that the announcement would be seen, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia continue to apply.
"The CASA currently has no specific rules on the use of electronic devices in the aircraft," it was explained.
The topic is subject to provisions whereby airlines maintain safety at all times and passengers must comply with the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already led conversation with the CASA about an extension of her Wi-Fi maintenance system on flights and explains that it is open to changes, but these should be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by the CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (no wireless entertainment) during the flight," one speaker said.
Qantas explained that the current rules will remain the same.
"Our current directives provide that electronic devices may not be used at startup and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that," the company explained.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations from which passengers can benefit, and we will certainly see the FAA decision as well as the reasons behind it.
The decision varies according to the age of the fleet in US companies.
You need to prove that your aircraft can tolerate radio interference by mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and customer instruction.
“After a airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use more portable, easier electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height,” the FAA announced.
In rare cases, the crew will show the passengers while the landing will turn off the devices.
In addition, the group recommended that heavy equipment should be transported safely under the seat or in the fields above the seat when starting and landing.
In front of the district village against Schalke, accompanying BVB trailers with light-tracts had taken care of ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced serious consequences.
Prior to the free play of the football Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras responded with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost spensive acoustic, which offered the viewer until just before the beginning of the federal league game between the German Vizemeister Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guests were listening to their prayers.
On the other hand, where the most faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand, the southern triangles first presented themselves extremely quiet: no songs, no battles.
The podium of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint fire, remained unoccupied.
And in front of the tribune, a large flag with the title "Station Prohibit".
Only as a Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller as always as the first BVB players entered the place, short-term jubilee burned up.
When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and weeping shals - but not far from everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern tribune, nothing happened.
Even that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel again mentioned the positive experiences of the last days - Derbysieg, victory over Arsenal, extension of the contract by Coach Jürgen Klopp - did not take care of the holiday pay.
Only five minutes before the anpfiff the Capo collapsed his pedest - and until then, the tension with the hands gripped was revealed in a loud cry, when the mood on the ranks in the stadium was questioned as usual.
Finally, as always, the southern tribune was on the row - and finally here again was the most popular place in the stadium.
And at the latest, as with anpfiff from the southern tribune, the loud call "Derbysier stands up" came, it was everything again as always.
The silence was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
In front of the FC Schalke 04, some of the accompanying BVB trailers had hit the sights and the square - and almost torhüter Roman Weiden fields.
The game was delayed because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tops of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and believes that Watzke's words was a rather uncomfortable date for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the whole ultra-movement," the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a podium discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke prevented the Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I have forbidden that," he explained.
We cannot give up zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultras were shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, such as Watzke, the BVB will impose a penalty by the end of the week.
"That's going to get in the way," assured Watzke.
You can be excited about how the reactions to the southern tribune then work.
Farmhouses tree in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle layer
Janani Amirthalinga, in a Pfandhaus in Bendemeer Shopping Centre in Singapore, exchanges a gold bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the tuition fees of her daughters.
“My husband and I just bought a house, where my whole money is in there,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (about 1,730 euros) every month as an administrative employee and her husband also works, she does not have enough monthly family income, she explains.
In fact, the demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where the debt of the households is increasing – is so great that ValueMax, where she has made her exchange, became the third floorhouse this week, which is listed at the Singapore Stock Exchange.
The promise of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, housekeepers in Singapore require an effective 17 per cent anniversary, which is just over 15.4 per cent required by the United Overseas Bank, a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, housekeepers offer the advantage that there is no need to verify creditworthiness or income, so loans are faster than banks are possible.
For this reason, millions of people in the region turn to houses after families feel the pressure of rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose financial policy in the developed economic areas, families with smaller and medium-income households are seeking to compensate for the difference in the economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's growing financial debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, was a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budgetary debt in Asia, according to the Agency's estimates, in relation to the gross domestic product.
Malaysia has 80 per cent of GDP at the top of the list, an increase of 60 per cent in 2008.
National economists are also concerned about high consumer debt in Thailand, which has come out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing export weakness and a remainder of the consumer demand.
"In the end, this means that, given the increasing costs, people in the middle to the lower segment (the income scale) will be trying to supplement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical peaks at the gold prices in the last two years have strengthened the trend to commit personal objects, as people use the opportunity to transform the beauty of the family into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the dedicated items are in the 200 houses of the city of Gold.
People say, "The gold price looks good, let's get Grandmother's gold chain and pick it up next month."
The largest Thai Pfandhaus operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20% customer growth in its branches over the last few months.
The growth in the retail business is so strong that ValueMax, the branch operator in Bendemeer and 15 more in Singapore, wants to expand not only to the neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company finances it with 60 per cent of the 66 million Singapore dollars that it took this week with the stock exchange in Singapore.
While some creditors have come to the crossfire due to high interest rates, Yeah explains that flat houses not only kill cheaper interest than other lenders, but also not directly increase the debt.
"Customs owe them items they already own, and the surplus of personal goods does not increase budgetary training," she explains.
The loan business is increasingly accepted as short-term, secure financing.
Also, not all people who use mortgages are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the branches of ValueMax to hire gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in bar.
Customers come to us from every social level.
“These include wellbeing that lend something to a business or investment in the short term, or small companies that need to bridge the gap in cash flow,” says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA saves data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The Secret Service Enthüller Edward Snowden has a primary interest in helping Germany to clarify the increasingly fragile NSA business.
Following the presentation of the Green-Bundagsagsagret, Hans-Christian Ströblee went on to say at his surprise meeting with Snowden in Russia, under what conditions would the former GHEI staff speak in a German public prosecutor's office or in front of a committee of inquiry.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care
The Australian government is subject to the harsh conditions associated with the rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian health sector to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money.
The Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth will take 'integrated measures' to remove a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island, a higher proportion of chronic diseases and system constraints.
The funding for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian deputy, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has drawn up an emergency rescue package which, in our view, addresses the unique challenges facing the state," Plibersek said today.
The 325 million-dollar package includes 31 million dollars immediate aid for election services.
Further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and treatments due to gray star, are to eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Lanceston, better post-vacutory care, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments correspond to the ideas that I have been told by the clinic staff concerned that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," Tanya Plibersek said.
The Minister was on a strict reporting and accounting obligation of the Government of Tasmania.
The state should maintain the current level of funding in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-head Commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the $325 million would be of little use only if "they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable course."
Despite this, he promised the government that it had responded to his urgent request for assistance, which he first expressed with regard to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I am confident that the federal aid will make a great contribution to the public health system of the state of emergency," Wilkie said.
According to the Government of the Federal State, these elections will largely eliminate the recent cuts.
But the health-political speaker of the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, is the view that today's announcement is only a "flash solution".
"We are therefore in a position today because the Labour Government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system," he said against ABC TV.
It can't be that a state government is getting almost half a billion dollars out of the system and the Commonwealth is entering 300 million and then doing it like the good news.
Dutton urged Plibersek to ensure that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be issued for additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Niceux' adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but it is also more expensive than necessary.
The action in France of the 1760s tells the fascinating story of Suzanne, a young nobleman sent by her family to the monastery.
When she rebel, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic Oberin and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never drifts away in lusterness or sensational listening – and there is its problem.
The festive seriousness with which the film is told also makes it for the public to be a quailer büßerhamd.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, so a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and gas ammunition, the global monitoring group for chemical weapons declared on Thursday, while in the north of the country there were serious conflicts near one of the sites where toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian group of activists announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed by the civil war just three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date
1 November, which was set up in the Hague by the Damascus organization to destroy or "inoperable" all facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons, including all machinery for the mixing of chemicals into poison gas and the filling of ammunition.
The completion of this process, which basically represents the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus must, however, begin to destroy existing weapons and supplies.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including Senfgas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting in the city of Safira on Thursday, the experts say that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and warehouses, as reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights in Britain.
The group of activists, following the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria, declared on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the part of the government, 29.954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hisbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 desert soldiers and 5,375 fighters of the opposition, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict from March 2011 to 100,000.
This number has not been updated so far.
The conflict has forced some two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting for weeks in Safira against the rebels, many of whom have connections to al-Qaida groups.
The observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention details.
The fights highlight the danger posed by the chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to free Syria from its poisonous weaponry is a race against the time in the midst of an added civil war.
According to the OPCW, which cooperates closely with the United Nations, the team “is now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing/premision facilities mentioned by Syria and has survived their destruction.”
Therefore, "there are currently no further inspection activities planned."
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had explained that they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 of the 23 sites identified by Damascus.
Because security concerns were not possible to visit two institutions, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC declared that, according to the Syrian statement, the two sites were “disposed ... and the existing objects of the chemical weapons programme were transferred to other institutions that were inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two institutions that could not visit the OPCW inspectors.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
"I draw attention to the courage and courage that you have shown in meeting the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director General of the Monitoring Organization, in a comment published by the OPCW.
For the past three years, the mainly Sunni Muslim bells have fought against the Assad government and its security forces, many of which belong to the Alawites, a disunity of the Shiite Islam.
With regard to further developments, observation group leader Rami Abdurrahman said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was unknown, he explained.
Anger over judgment for bombers of Bali
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people who were killed in 2002 at the bombing in Bali were angry at the verdict of the last of the activists, who were brought before the court, as Umar Patek should have been shot in accordance with the law.
Patek, who has been on the run for nearly ten years as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the construction of explosives.
He could be released after 15 years in criminal proceedings.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of the mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
A debt was also incurred in a number of terrorist-related charges, including a wave of explosives attacks on churches in Indonesia on the Holy See in the year 2000.
The Public Prosecutor had demanded a lifelong penalty, even if it was for the man who was also referred to as the "Demolition Man" who could have applied for the death penalty because of his reputation as a master bomber.
The decision caused painful memories at June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in the miscarriage set up by Patek and his co-sponsors almost ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guy.
"You should put him in front of a shooting command," Corteen said to AAP.
I have to live every day so that I won't get another single and I'll never see my daughter again.
The Sari Club was built on the ground, when on October 12, 2002, shortly after 23 o'clock, a powerful bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the night club.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide killer had an explosive-filled backpack exploded.
He fell into the coma and died three times a month after the attack, while he was hanging on a life support system.
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were directed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty first and foremost.
Let him live – no, there is no reason to let him live.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and hurting many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bomb that stood before the court.
He retired almost a decade of arrest, but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US troops almost four months later killed the former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden.
During the negotiations, an FBI agent said that secret service reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan in order to meet with the goal of re-establishing the link between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He hasn't put up with it," Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no regret about how much suffering he has added to other people.
The judgment took place on the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be held with commemorative celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," Corteen said.
Patek may appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not conduct phone calls)
Flyers can now hear their electronic devices for reading, working, playing, music and using the viewing of films from departure to landing, but not telephone calls, so the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
As soon as they were implemented, from the respective airline, FAA staff member Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
The airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the flight personnel training manuals and the arrangements for the disposal of the equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA explained that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among these airlines.
"According to the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
Currently passengers must turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They may only start again when the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain has a green light.
When entering the country flight, the passengers must turn them off again and they must not restart until the aircraft has landed.
According to the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are protected from electronic disturbances could allow their passengers to use the equipment also at startup, landing and on the runway, the FAA explained.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft, which have been converted to higher levels for the use of Wi-Fi, should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Airplanets, welcomed the changes.
“If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline – both sides will benefit from it,” Glading commented.
We are really sorry to have to feel like a vigilante on this issue.
However, Internet connections to surf, exchange of e-mails, text messages or download of data below three kilometres were still prohibited, the Authority explained.
Passengers are invited to move smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So there's still no "Words With Friends", the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines in public because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the flight path.
And harder devices such as laptops must continue to be contaminated, as there is a danger of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Phone calls during the flight are also still prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls is with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA may have a ban on certain electronic devices when starting and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the Transport Safety Authority National Transportation Safety Board, safety experts for national transport issues on CBS News, phones would still be considered as a risk.
"Handy really is a problem not only because they could cause potential disturbances on navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that air transmission can also disrupt transmitters," says Rosenker.
A Consultative Committee of the Industry, launched by the FAA to investigate this topic, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA has increased to release restrictions on use.
Critics like the democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri represent the view that there are no valid security grounds for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to implement because the use of the devices has become widespread.
In some studies, the speech that up to one third of the passengers forgets or ignores the shutdown of the device is one thing.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by air-broadcasters after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices by passengers had become known to UKW radios, which were then the latest technology trend.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also so designed and approved by the FAA that they do not have any electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for some years now when the flight altitude is reached.
The planes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more sensitive to interferences.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the increased use of electronic devices under the new directives, said Huerta.
Today’s electronic devices generally give significantly less radio radiation than previous generations.
For example, e-reader only emits minimum radiation when switched.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
Amazon.com is one of the perpetrators of a lockdown of the restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers.
In 2011, company employees played a passenger plane full of Kindle E-reader and made a test flight to detect problems, but could not find it.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd of the Passenger Association National Association of Airline Passengers said he was the view that the interference by the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only single reports of pilots talking about the disruption of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to direct, in the case of instrument landing under poor visual conditions, the decommissioning of the devices by passengers.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travellers who would be widely equipped with technology today.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in conflict with security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Freed by the rescue service of North Sea Bohrinsel Saved Bird
A flight rescue service on the coast of a flying bird, which was found exhausted on a North Sea Bohrin Island, was released again to nature.
The waterwheel was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was absorbed by the Scottish Animal Protection Organisation SPCA in their rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: "This waterwheel was probably a winter train bird from northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong wind over the North Sea."
Apparently the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drill island.
He added: “He could no longer fly, so we were contacted with the help request.”
When it was released, the waterwheel was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who in the UK want to change our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 economic leaders, representing the British sizes, sectors and regions.
Many will be surprised by the results of the survey.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are currently exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while states in the EU are stagnant.
They hope that the government will promote new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than stop the long and demanding process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
When asked about certain legal issues, from cartel law to product law, the majority of economic leaders of the view that control over these key competences should be withdrawn to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction over the internal market, as according to the statement of companies, the costs of the Brussels rules would in the meantime outweigh the benefits of being part of the European Trade Area – even 40 percent of the major companies agreed to the most traditional of Europe's friendly ones.
Finally, and this is probably the case, our inquiry by economic leaders revealed that a clear majority of Britain is seeking a course towards changing the agreement and not a relationship with the EU, based on trade, on politics.
This recognition, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy is pushing for a "significant change" that brings the burden of action back to Britain.
It is a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Great Britain would lead to 16% change of opinion in favour of the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan for the renegotiation of the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a clear shift in power from a renegotiation to the UK.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the euro area is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the results of our survey show, which means a stronger focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulations.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom refers to pipelines in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas station
The start of the construction of the South Stream Pipeline in Bulgaria represents the start of one of the largest European energy projects, the Gazprom CEO explained.
"Today's event is a milestone: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream Gaspipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said the chairman of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is intended to provide Europe with more diversity in Russia's export routes.
A dispute between Gazprom and its pendant in Ukraine, where most of the Russian gas for Europe is stored, provides for an increased risk for conventional routes, as can be heard from the official side.
Miller said that the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were off forever.
Bulgarian consumers get gas from South Stream to benefit from tariffs when the entire project is in operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction works in other subordinate countries will start on the planned route by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed at an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees charged against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were accused of sexual misconduct in connection with children, before 2011 proposals were raised against the childcareer Jonathan Lord of Caringbah, as the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children experienced.
However, in the opening declaration before the Commission, the YMCA stated that the organisation had never been involved in an incident involving sexual abuse of children.
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which an YMCA employee was charged with child pornography and another in which a sports teacher at the YMCA Caringbah Hall 1991 was convicted of abuse of trusted children.
Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assistant lawyers, that he knew of the first case, but did not know the second one.
He argued that the YMCA’s opening statement to the Commission was also unclear in the claim that ‘the YMCA’s external checks, in which the YMCA was recognised as the top priority for child safety, had been issued’.
The evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the two-day highest assessment of four possible quality in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 at YMCA, argued that the management had "downside me" failed in setting up Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the child safety directives.
Lord was sentenced to 12 boys at the beginning of the year for sexual misconduct during his two-year activity for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare argues, however, that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that the employee had stopped reporting Lord's violations in relation to the safety of children.
The employees said that they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, she privately cared for as a babysitter, she sat on his gun, said he loved it, and let children play with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose chairman was Lord and who had prayed for a child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the childcare director, Jacques Barnat, who was the pre-lawed Lords at YMCA Caringbah, was "very frightened and most of the time was very unbearable".
The manager explained that he would not accept the statements of employees, which they did not trust to repay their pre-declaration.
Instead, as he said, his friendship with Lord had affected his judgmental powers, so they had not notified him.
Hare explained that he informed the board of the YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organisation had to draw from the "Jonathan-Lord-Interval" was "not reporting" by employees, and the board agreed with him.
Hare said that the decision to force employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the charges were committed was made by the managing director of the YMCA child services, Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent the contamination of the evidence, but that was "transmissible" and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was at the time when Jonathan Lord was busy there between 2009 and 2011, not a safe organization for children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on sexual abuse, explained the Commission.
He explained that there were “serious problems” in the recruitment, review, recruitment, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was held until 20 December.
Tony Blair explained that he would use the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister – but he argues that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the fifth day of the year of his resignation from the office, 59-year-olds announced his views on various domestic issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided expressing himself to British politics, and his comments on foreign policy and his role as envoy of the Quartet of the Peace Foundations in the Middle East have been limited.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair of the Evening Standard from London was quoted as saying: "Yes, I am sure, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so ..."
When the horse-show experts found themselves in Charming in Cardiff to choose the horse of the year, they were aware that a hard competition was taking over.
But no one was prepared for the three years old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in the kindergarten and only a few months ago, took his first steps, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee went loose through the three rounds and got the first prize – leaving 30 grown opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both equally large, were praised for their appearance, behaviour and style in the annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
At his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had set up his counters in a cool corner and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which are far above his age.
And Toffee received bestnotes for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift on his third birthday and since then has been practicing with Shetland-Pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great strain."
They had to go against the entire field of participants and went out of the square with gold pokal and rosette.
It was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena kept him for so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from Nantyglo village near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been leading horses for over ten years.
Howells said: “The whole audience was as electricized and everyone fired him and laughed at him.”
He walked on sand the entire length of the arena and even though he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farmyards and has two chickens he cares about.
As it is started, it won't take long until it's on the " horse of the year" show – and I'm sure it'll cut well.
One speaker of the annual horseshow said: “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
Together they're a great team.
The jury evaluated Fenton and Toffee after how well they had beaten themselves and presented themselves in the lead.
They looked at good cooperation between Pony and the leader – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's cute clothes contributed to her part, which was really perfect for the occasion.
The Chinese newspaper is to be "reformed" after the call
A Chinese newspaper, which on the title page demanded the release of a reporter who was accused of defamation, was to be reformed, explained a press regulator.
The New Express, located in Guangzhou, had issued a rare public call to release journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later reported on television that he had accepted bribery money to fake reports about a foreign company.
Now the new Express will be subject to a "extensive rectification", the regulatory authority explained.
The "Rechitifierungunung" was drawn up by the Office for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary findings showed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several relevant reports on the company Zoomlion listed between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was unorganized," the regulatory authority announced in a statement.
She said it was decided to "enforce an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and to withdraw his license".
In addition, “the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to undertake a complete rectification of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant New Express responsible and to immediately review the new Express leadership team.”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machines called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the title page and behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen came up on state television and said he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he explained to the CCTV of the state broadcaster.
I did it first because I was out of money and fame.
It's clear to me that I did wrong.
Following Chens' apology, the New Express issued an apology on the title page and explained that it was neglected to check the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently filed complaints on TV.
Experts say that complaints are still routinely forced, despite a change in the law at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were prohibited from forcing others to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnel discovered with its own railway between the USA and Mexico
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric railway operation, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities describe the 120 times 90 centimetre tunnel as one of the most flawed passages they have ever found.
The tunnel, which runs over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless invisible warehouses that make it easier to hide with drugs loaded trucks.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported there, the authorities explained.
During the discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured, so the records of the Court.
Three men, according to the statement of the authorities as drivers, were charged for the possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
You are threatened with prison sentences between ten years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eight large passage that has been discovered since 2006 in San Diego.
Some of the biggest tunnels have been discovered after the Marihuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which presents the drug cartels with the challenge of how they can quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640 metres long passage with rails that passed from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Players Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has expressed himself for the separation of his wife, Top Model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, who was supposed to be broadcast on Friday (placetime), Bloom said, "Life sometimes doesn't go exactly as we plan or hope".
Kerr and he still loved each other, stressed the 36-year-old.
"We will support each other and love each other as Flynn's parents."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and her son Flynn was born in 2011.
Veganism, according to Lexika, is subject to Vegetarianism, but it is quite different from this.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to consume sage, ice, or a strong edam, these badgers do not stand on the food map of a vegetarian.
Milk, cheese, eggs, in addition to meat and fish, the Vegan leaves off all the consumption of animal products - also honey is destroyed.
What remains may be asked, but in closer consideration, the vegan food world is characterized by a remarkable impact.
"Brotupstrache is very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the home reform house, which provides a variety of special products for Veganers.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in the domgasse.
For 13 years, the native New Zealander vegan has been living in Lampertheim, and he has found everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian."
About the turn of the century, the next step took, and I became Veganer.
"But the conviction came not only because of the food, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, the art leather prefers normal leather.
He recognized that there are other everyday concerns without animal products.
First of all, vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor says the maximum of the Vegans, which extends to all consumer behaviour.
Instead of congratulating Burgers, Pipers or Gummers, Vegan quickly discovered new products, and the enthusiasm grew.
"It's a double bonus," Proctor says today, "in fact, vegan does not represent his forgiveness, not ascetics, but it's a field increase."The assumption that with the food exchange the selection of food options is reduced, Proctor returns to the power of the habit.
And these conditions also caused some to fail in such a well-meaning attempt.
"The search factor is a very decisive factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor presents a comparison.
And apply: "Determined tasters are not to be attached to the animal."
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also produce the same effect in other ways," explains the Veganer.
Proctor, for example, brings Aubergines, Champignons and a few Vegan Forests to a barbecue party.
He takes into account a balanced, varied diet, where it should even taste thoroughly.
Of course you want something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but it's not just to reduce animal food," said Proctor.
Health damage up to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he has not suffered.
For me, conversion had a positive aspect.
I don't take a foreign cholesterol and I have an increased vitamin count.
There are high-performance athletes who feed exclusively on vegan.
"My blood values are fine, I get checked often," traitor Proctor said.
In particular, in the face of the lack of vitamin B12, many Vegansimus critics warn.
"Because animals are fed with feed instead of grass on the grass, it is questionable whether in the meat you buy in the refrigerator, the vitamin B12 portion is high," says Proctor.
For Vegans, there is also the possibility of taking the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
A wide range of ways Proctor did not have to go for food purchase.
There are basic foods everywhere and every supermarket now has soyamilch and other products.
Everything I need, I'll find the place.
I'm just buying something special.
"Many people ignore the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but this is how "normal" finished products are also known."
Without it, the preparation of vegan courts was far more favourable and less time-consuming, than generally accepted.
"In the kitchen there is much to discover, with a few small knuckles you can do good if you don't get some better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little bit more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of eggs, with his vegan cassettes, Proctor could also bring his parents to the ground.
Family parties give the Vegan a new kiss.
It has dynamics when you cook together, it has a new value.
"The situations that can arise in this are as different as the people themselves," Proctor says.
Of course, he was already confronted with Skepsis.
Don't you taste my food anymore?
"If I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - in such questions you should act like a vegetarian with a fingertip feeling.
"I don't deny the people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to get an enclave.
And more precisely, the everyday world does not seem as vegan as likely - and the Vegan is not as limited as usual.
Fast food is also allowed.
There's Pommes everywhere!
"Many doll shops offer falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he leans out on pasta dishes, or orders a pizza without cheese, all a question of habit.
The restaurants are so slow on.
"When I began to feed vegan 13 years ago, it was even more difficult," the New Zealand could discover a development: "You have to talk to people, they're paying attention to it."
"If enough requests come, they may be inclined to supplement the food card," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants develop, such as the Mannheim Kombüse or the Café Birdfree.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants have at least one vegan court on the menu.
In fact vegan courts for all there are taken.
Everyone can eat it, so they're exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"On the other hand, meat dishes are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor states.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, Veganism is a safe way to make most of the above impossible," says Proctor.
The purchase of vegan products may be difficult at first.
In particular, if one learns to understand that animal additives can also be included in earthnuts as colouring agents, it seems to leave courage quickly with the fulfillment of ethics in so many horrors and falls.
Not only has Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are added to food but also cleaning products.
"After and after you develop a scan view and know what signs and logos you have to look at "It is sometimes better to take steps than to stand or stick," says Proctor.
Veganism, it is an important moral sign that strikes the conscience.
He may not be able to completely abandon his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits critically.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers still in breath.
Trade in the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon in Germany.
In a communication, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other eleven US option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business uninterrupted.
The latest case continues a whole series of smaller and larger pans with the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday the Nasdaq indices were not calculated for an hour due to data transport errors.
In August of this year, there were only two pans in one week.
First, the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs sent massively flawed purchase orders to options markets due to technical problems.
After that, stock exchange operators needed almost a whole day to browse and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of the entire stock market in the United States came to an end because of a computer stick at the Nasdaq stock exchange for several hours.
In addition, last year the stock exchange had taken care of Facebook.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flow of purchase and sales orders, later determined the stock exchange supervision of SEC and decommissioned the company to a record penalty of $10 million.
Constant: Wheeler carries 63-year-olds
The accident was reported by the police, when a 26-year-old man was on his way from the railway station to the market station, at 22 a.m., with a lady's bike in an orderly manner.
Suddenly, when a 63-year-old man walked from a local road, the bicycle driver said the police couldn't stop in time.
On the following collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the house wall, went to the ground in the further course and pulled a 15-centimeter-long square wall to the head.
A rescue team brought the injured to the clinic for medical treatment.
British police issue an issue order to Assange
Today, the British police have issued a release order to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian message in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard explained that a 40-year-old Australian had been assigned a "commitment to stand up" that asked him to appear in a police station, and added that he should not comply with it, threatened him with the arrest.
Assange threatens to deliver to Sweden because of the charges in a sexual delicacy after its possibilities have been exhausted under British law, since the Supreme Court has rejected its opposition to the issue at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would deliver him to the United States, he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19th and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has called on "a 40-year-old man to be present at a time chosen by us at a police station," one speaker explained.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The message did not give any comment on the delivery of the police call.
Assange is afraid that he will be delivered from Sweden to the United States and charged there for possible spying outs, after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on WikiLeaks' disclosure website.
A driver with 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs will receive a fine of £1,000.
A driver was charged with a fine of £1,000 because he was driving up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27th with his Mercedes Benz at the A120 at Braintree.
After the police had stopped him, they discovered the cup between his legs.
Before the Colchester Court, Howie was found guilty of not having the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay costs of £90 as well as a victim's allowance of £100.
Tax on foreign real estate owners against London's speculative blow
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Treasury Chancellor George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget had imposed a stamp tax of 7% on apartments that cost more than two million pounds and annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as a company and not as individuals.
The income from the stamp tax for housing in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which were at 708 million pounds in 2012/13, is already higher than the income for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: “After the increase in stamp tax on high-priced apartments and the introduction of the related legislation against handling, high-quality properties can be claimed to be too low, regardless of the effects of the old system of taxes.”
"But this step could make some foreign investors less attractive, as regards the purchase of properties in London or the sale of owners to stop it," he added.
First-class properties – the top five to ten percent of the apartment market at price – in the well-being of Southwest London, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, have estimated the record value of 11.8% last year.
The prices in Central London showed an even annual growth of 5.6%, but were overestimated by a rising domestic market, where the south-west part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced a upward trend, such as a study by Savills.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the context of a dog's tailing with his voice.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail spread more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while in nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists say other dogs can see and react to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: “People are well aware that the left and right brains differ in response to stimuli, causing positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just as in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral fungus of their species, researchers monitor the animals while these films of other dogs appear.
They measured the heart rate of the four bones and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the tail moves once in one, once in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown the dogs films with dogs – either a true version of nature or a silhouette to eliminate derogating other aspects, and thus we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or the right.”
When the animals saw how another voiceless dog moved the tail to the right (seeing from the perspective of the waving dog), they remained completely relaxed.
However, the tendon was mainly left (from the perspective of the dog, which welded), and their heart rate rose and they looked uneasy.
According to Professor Vallortigara, dogs do not communicate intentionally through these movements.
He is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience what movements they should worry about and when not.
He said: “If you have different encounters with other dogs and the weed with the tail is more closely linked to friendly behavior and the right hand rather produces less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences.”
Researchers say that the knowledge of dog owners, veterinarians and trainers could help you to better understand the emotions of your animal.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Animal Health at the University of Bristol explained that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important for dogs.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University found out that dogs turn their heads left when they see an aggressive dog and right when it's a happy dog.
In another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following was: “The dogs go to a robot dog if he’s ‘swanz’ on the left and not on the right, instead of becoming restless – just different from in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore lead to the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
“Although there are significant evidence for many different mammals that the two brains are used for different purposes, many of the details still have to be determined – and dogs do not make an exception,” says Bradshaw.
Since their behavior is easy to record, it will probably not last long until we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys move performance in Glasgow due to Alex Turners' disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock band has moved a performance in Glasgow after her lead singer has been diagnosed with convulsions.
The band from Sheffield should play in the hydro on Friday.
Because of the illness of the lead singer Alex Turner, however, the concert must now be postponed.
The announcement of the band came after she had to move a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys reported: “After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and at medical advice, Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1st.”
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with a convulsion, which is why he cannot appear."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham is now held on 20 November, which was transferred to the Hydro in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets maintain validity for this show.
We apologize to all ticket holders for the inconveniences caused by this.
Please contact the customer service to which you bought the ticket if you need further support.
Pope Francis Marked the First Cardinal in February
Pope Francis was first called a new cardinal of the Catholic Church on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also those who choose a Pope, so that Francis will be named the first group of men who will finally be involved in the election of his successor.
Currently there are 201 Cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the pope’s throne – this applies to a group of 120 “elected Cardinals”.
In a statement in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a speaker of the Vatican, said that there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony to appoint the new cardinals, which is also known as the Consistorium, was held.
"Papst Franciskus has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistency in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of Cardinals from all over the world can be planned," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals would probably be reduced until February.
He explained that a pope would normally honor as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of eligible cardinals would be 120 again, and so many cardinals over 80 as he wished.
The Consistency next year is therefore important because it was the first since the election of Francis in March this year, according to Valero.
At present, there is a certain overlap on the part of Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will restore Cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called after the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, to find a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He explained that it was "possible" that Francis asked the Cardinals for advice.
But so far we haven't been in this situation – that's all new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from large places would call cardinals, but Francis was "full of surprises – so we don't know who he calls".
GM calls new pickup trucks in the USA to repair the seat belt
General Motors calls back almost 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks with construction year 2014 to address a problem with the manually adjustable seat, so a communication from the US regulatory authority for vehicle safety on Friday.
In some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for setting back the front seat.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Directive on vehicle safety in the case of head restraints.
“When driving from the back of the vehicle, it is possible that the head restraints do not protect the occupants properly, so that there is an increased risk of injury” was to be read in the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The returned models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and represents the main start of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners in the first half of October about the defect.
The NHTSA could not verify the notification letter due to the 16-day Shutdown government, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
The sale of Silverado and Sierra Trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, explained GM on Friday.
In October, GM 42,660 sold Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM stock rose by 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon at the New York Stock Exchange.
Double-declining depreciation [d]
I have chosen President Obama twice in the hope that change will be possible
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by the block-adhesive tactics of the Republicans
Blockage policy does not blame Obamacare's website problems, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 election are a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a terrible sad book right now.
It's a book that I believed would raise me during the troubled second year of my medical study and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and describes the memoirs Barack Obamas for the 2008 presidential election.
When I am finished with my patient subscriptions in the evening and go to bed, then the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions and for a reason could take the breath away.
The election was held as a victory for Earth and news speakers to lead to the historic significance of this hour.
My classmates cried out for joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to the office in 2008, he had 82% of the votes.
And then I close the book.
To switch again to the present is a bad wake, as if to be torn out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad opinion of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first voted, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and varied things Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Disease Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced disappearance of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that the party-political block-debate tactics have made too many efforts to bring our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay to name just a few.
But once I have defended Obama's government against colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I am in favour of my attempts to explain it at the end.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican Blockage Policy cannot explain why it allows the hearing of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones in the overseas region.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans and why Whistleblowers are being punished for public misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, was murdered without procedures and why public funding and spending limits are being exceeded during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report, in which the efforts of the White House to calm the media are the most "aggressive ... since the Nixon government".
And recently it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in which more than three years after the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
I should have understood with 18 that government work could be contrary to its previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the deputy's name is not a predictable course, since an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre mark the public debate.
But when I look at the examples mentioned above, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And most of the time, it bothers me.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
In the midst of Romney there was a confusing and unparalleled alternative that he did not seem to be able to determine his direction and position.
I had the impression that a second time for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope that we had heard so long ago.
However, with the decline in the acceptance values for Obama to less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 by this book has become so severe.
It wakes up in me the desire for the many promises that have dissolved into the air.
This week, I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to make a serious loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania elections.
At a meeting with the election assistants after the decision, he told his employees that they had to return to the course and follow the purpose of their case.
"I want us to find our magic again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more strongly with you.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest on parental leave
The billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters become pregnant and can therefore benefit from it.
The Bergbaumagnat, which is in a judicial dispute over the payment of $6 million in CO2 tax, raised the claim that he wanted to erase questions from the table whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for the decision whether the CO2 and mining taxes are cut or cut.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that the daughters of Abbott would benefit personally from the laws.
“He is in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she gets a vacation or not,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Election Commission officially declared 53 votes in favour of the re-calculation as the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax.
Palmer called for a revision of the voting process so that they could be replaced more quickly.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Whether these elections should be decided two months after the end of the vote.
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system in which data is entered into a computer, picked immediately and then got the result at 6:30 p.m. at night?
Palmer also criticised the use of cheerleaders when marking the vote list.
Do you use it because you can radiate the results if you don't like it?
To agree with cheerleaders today is incredible.
The Election Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, explained that his policy is an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office “very seriously”.
In the case of a public office, it concerns the service to the public.
"We are seeking no reward except history, that is, that we can serve in a critical time of this community," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange office, so two persons familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global government investigation into the need for manipulations in the currency market is rapidly taking place.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with the authorities in the investigations of the world's largest financial market, to which $5.3 billion per day changes the owner.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the extensive investigation that the scandal is taking place around the Libor interbank business.
The Bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from the authorities.
"Our investigations on this issue continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," the Bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, the situation was reported to the public that the RBS forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent from and to an earlier trader to the UK Supervisory Authority, which was the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is currently supposed to be authorised from his current position as European leader of the Forex spot trade at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European Spot Trading at Citi, was approved this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly head of currency at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders were subjected to any misbehaviour.
To Usher's immediate message group, bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup, said the situation is close to people.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authorities had explained that it was investigating a moderate manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world — the European Commission, Finland, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — are currently dealing with concerns about which banks should have agreed on transactions in the monetary market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks travel through instant messages and e-mails from several years looking for cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has prompted traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year has been under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the business and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the expanded and high-level liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders are of the opinion that this is not necessarily true.
One leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange exchange, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of its own internal platforms by banks could lead to “the market being affected by very low fares”.
The message came out on the same day as Credit Suisse announced, she announced this week a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Fund offices after he had lost almost six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank shall promptly inform the competent authorities and cooperate with them.
"We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter has been resolved," Credit Suisse explained.
Painted the building on the Bechle ground piece
A group of citizens' initiative "Sweizer Wiese" has decorated the building on the Bechtle ground at the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
Also, she cleaned and spread the path, called in a press release.
The planned coverage of the falling house in the back of the property was not allowed for safety reasons, as the site was threatened to be demolished.
Alfred Abel, who is currently managing the property, had agreed with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Prior to the BI's action, a transparant with the message "We are for it".
However, there was little interference with the action taken by the approximately 20 members of the citizens' initiative.
Her motto on the big poster was, "We're against the Bauruins."
So she wanted to point to the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - the giant project should fail one day.
In the discussion with many passengers before the "Building" it became clear that some citizens believe that it will go much better with the implementation of the city's project, although not few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they began to resign, because the city further exacerbated these answers, it is called on the BI side.
As you can see, the public statements of the mayor also work.
At the municipal meeting in May, he had said that he was afraid of the storm for the thermal bath, so the population should vote against the plans for a bath and wellness complex on the Swiss side.
Some appear to be too frightened, others feel like a "pump-pression attempt" in the population, that is to say, in the BI press release.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Ranknick shell for Shiris: I don't have a Schwalbenking king
Ralf Rangnick is also satisfied with the current high-ranking of the Bundesliga-Tablelenführer Red Bull Salzburg, and the sports director of the "bulls" of the divorce courts was disappointed.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be forced into the category of Schwalbenking kings," he took the two offensive virbules on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg in protection.
The youngest reason for Ranknick's criticism was Yellow for Man at 3:0 against Grodig on the last Sunday, when the Senegalese became a supposed actress to be hanged - which was not freely as the TV images showed.
"A great mistake," said Rangnick, the judge Harkam described as "completely overreached".
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grodig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the party.
He defended his German countryman: "I would have behaved in every situation like Roger Schmidt".
Schmidt himself wants to have no contact with his colleague after the Scharmüttel with Hütter.
I didn't know why.
"Because I am the one who was injured," stressed 46-year-olds.
However, in view of the success of the race, Ranknick agreed to a praise.
"There are only two words for that," he noted.
There's not much to put off.
Above all, the way the team plays is impressive.
It's supposed to go on like this.
There will be hardly any changes in the winter transfer time.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"Besides a player, he wishes to leave the association," Rangnick explained.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's Health Act
It is a great victory for the Obama government: The U.S. Supreme Court today decided that the health law closely related to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual member of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it requires US citizens to complete a health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional within the framework of the State's tax authority.
The chief judge John Roberts was on the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also expressed the view that the health law provided by the Federal States should either extend the conditions for access to Medicaid or otherwise delete all state Medicaid claims, should not be inconsistent with the Constitution.
The appeal procedure against the Act was imposed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The Act was rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the last challenge in the Middle Romney election in 2012.
Norway: Norwegian place with giant mirrors Light
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village brought light to their dark valley.
Due to the low sunfall rate, the Rjukan, located in the Westfjord valley, usually falls from autumn to spring in the shadow of the surrounding mountains.
With three giant reflectors at 45 meters high, a century dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!", Mayor Steinar Bergsland heated at the opening ceremony on TV2.
Some of the hill dwellers stood up right on sun chairs, while others set up sunglasses of safety.
So far, in the winter, the sun was hungry and had to ride on a track path to a close summit.
Ten years ago, local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to link the beams with mirrors to the valley.
But this basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council finally adopted the 5 million crowns (about EUR 615,000) of expensive project.
A similar construction has been providing the Italian Alpine resort Viganella winter sunshine for several years.
Can not get message: %s %s
"Many citizens will not have noticed that the red points for the Sunday break are still on various mailboxes of the city and the city parts, but if you read the small printed on the yellow containers of Post AG, you will quickly find out that the break on Sundays and holidays is no longer taking place," the FDP informs.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays only before the post building is taught in Ernst-Ludwig Street 36 and in Jakob-Müller Street 1 in Hüttenfeld.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten is also taught on Sundays, the answer to the FDP's request will not be answered.
The social and youth political speaker of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to echo here.
The Sunday break is an important postal service just at the time of the deadline.
"In spite of the increase in prices for letters in January 2013, this enterprise is radically and irreplaceable."
Thomas Bittner, president of the Liberals' Group and city associations, supports his group colleagues: "What bothers me is the fact that the times of separation are changed or even deleted here.
From nearby citizens, the post is miles away.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten have to be taught again on Sunday," says Bittner and Røhrenbeck unisono.
Also applicable to the core city, especially non-mobile citizens had to be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday delivery on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration was planning a discussion with the post on this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
His knowledge, however, also gives him a Sunday break in Hofheim.
Your party has spoken for privatisations.
"Then decisions were made elsewhere," said Maier.
Frankfurter Park Fees to Increase Severely
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
Today, the city's magistrate advises on a presentation by traffic director Stefan Majer (Green).
Thus, parking fees should be increased by 50 per cent.
However, the prices should not be increased, but the time interval of parking hours and parking lots should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, then, the City Board of Governors still has to decide.
The IHK Frankfurt retail committee holds the "no good idea".
The possibility of parking immediately before the business was "a non-estimating advantage for smaller dealers".
The German Transport Club believes that an increase after two decades is "attractable and actually long overdue".
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast actions interrupt host
With a narrow frame, the men of the TSV Freudenstadt in the Schiller-Sculturnhalle in Reutlingen had to approach the TG Gönningen from the Schwäbische Alb.
The old men were with an experienced team on the other side of the network.
Soon, however, it turned out that they, even under the age of, could not fully maintain the rapid actions of the friendly cities.
With the hard and well-placed lifts, the gönninger was extremely difficult.
Repeatedly, they missed the steps and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz and were not in place in the block defense.
Two high first sentences clearly expressed the superiority of the city of pleasure in all interests.
In view of this compelling and decisive performance, the third sentence was then won somewhat lazily and indiscriminately at 3:0 (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On 2 November, with the Baiersbronn TV, which could be clearly implemented in Nagold, a significantly stronger opponent will be on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt stood in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard fight two hours match.
Nervousness on both sides caused mainly mistakes and punctuation; also at the feet was the precision at the time of lack of software, and in some critical scenes the upper party prevented the view of possible score gains.
In this powerfully balanced encounter, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team agreed through the great physical use and a happy commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small English cabin
At the same time, a group of participants engaged in the small English cabin in Ibach met in the fifth maintenance day following the Natura 2000 project of the upper Hotzenwald.
As a result of suggestions from the population, on that day, in the area of the shelter of the view of the valley, Mayor Helmut Kaiser said.
Many hikers, so Kaiser, described this area as the glazing piece of the cliff, on which the landscape offers the ideal framework for wonderful views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was an appropriate instrument to strengthen the link between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to put emphasis in nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, environmental considerations can also be found.
This ecological aspect explained Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Natural Protection of the Government Bureau of Freiburg following the welcome by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the Screening and the action wanted a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the wide view covers the goal of keeping the old Almendweid field with its specific protected types of living space by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare mammals and rodents, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest surfaces.
They need these free connections to maintain species.
Tribukait said she did not want to miss out on this place to break a spear for the planned biospheric area.
In this plan, the current measure does not only apply closely.
A biospheric area also offers the opportunity to sustain economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognized Unesco status and thus an ongoing addition to the life project and the previous maintenance days for the future.
After these various performances, River Director Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff shared the help in groups.
The larger trees had already been hit in advance, the forstschlepper was ready to pick up if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of Wacholder showers and the maintenance of a dry stone line.
The goal was the free view at the point of view.
Running: Cups still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarsädtchen Löffingen can be described as an attractive city with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a future-oriented school, children's, youth's and senior policy, as well as its own urban works as an attractive city, no second mayor candidate has yet been registered.
As the only candidate for the successor of the no longer candidates for age, Mayor Norbert Brugger is the 46-year-old banker and business manager Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen.
The application period will expire on Monday 11 November at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei for Northel patents
The group, which has thousands of previous Nortel patents, insisted on a number of complaints on a patent infringement against mobile manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, the company that he was banned when Nortel was insolvent.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for 4.5 billion US dollars, claimed Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies because of patent violations in front of the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is located in the community of Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is detected in seven cases of patent infringement.
The patents concern technology that brings search terms into line with relevant advertising on the Internet, so the complaint that hits the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC present phones working with Google’s Android operating system, which is in a strong competition for Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of over 900 million dollars for the Nortel patents.
Google has increased its supply several times and lastly offered 4.4 billion US dollars.
After being transferred to the Northel patents by Rockstar, Google Motorola Mobility acquired $12.5 billion, a business that was also motivated by the part of Motorola's library of patents.
“Although Google is disappointed with his attempt to acquire the patents in the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so,” he writes.
Rockstar calls for a high compensation from Google, as it claims that Google's patent breach is intentional, so the charge.
Egypt's first freely elected president
Mohammed Mursi leaves the office, but his day of triumph must not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a "new Egypt", when he was defeated as the first freely elected president of the country and the successor of Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled 16 months earlier from the office.
With its establishment before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi has also been the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and fifth head of state of Egypt since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He laid down the oath before the 18 judges dressed in black Roben, who had his seat at the Nile and found an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic," Mursi said at the celebration ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability," said 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer trained in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been taken into the vision since its establishment 84 years ago as a banned organization from the respective government.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guard the building, when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven o'clock.
Only a few hundred adherents had gathered before the court to cheer the new president, and contrary to the presidiumal principle of Mubarak time, traffic was stopped only for a short time so that the convoy could cross the usual inhabited road that connects the city centre to the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic "resistance" of the brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a speech of freedom, in which he not only presented himself as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to target the rebellion from 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," explained Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with red tie, to the judges in the wooden chamber in which he placed the office.
Mursi later went to the University of Cairo, where he was to hold his lecture.
He was officially welcomed by an army chaplain who played the national anthem he heard in port.
The military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of participants in the largest auditorium of the university with talks by "The Army and the people are a hand".
The University of Cairo, founded in 1908 as the foundation of secular education, has developed into a high-class Islamic student group in the 1970s.
Mursi laid down a symbolic oath on Friday at the Tahir Square, the place of birth of the rebellion, which led to the end of Mubarak's authoritarian rule, and he promised to reclaim the presidential powers which the Military Council had assumed from the head of state under the authority.
However, with the exception of the official oath before the court and not as usual before Parliament, he submits to the military's will, which indicates that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursis spoke on the Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides for two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberger discothek "Blue Velvet" began.
Today's Friday evening it's called "Pump this party", tomorrow's Saturday evening it goes on with an Ü 25 party.
Fette Beats and cool sounds are naturally promised by the organizers on two days.
Workers broke down by leaders: hard injured
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell by a manager and injured himself.
The man from Lamprechthausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor at the outside facade of a guest house.
When he went up to the roof-based leader, he broke out and the man broke down on the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was brought with the rescue screwer "Christophorus 6" to the Salzburg National Hospital.
Violent in South Africa: twice lifelong prison
Nine months after the brutal rape and rape of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the killer was sentenced to two lives on Friday.
This was reported by the SABC sender.
The victim was later killed as a result of the serious injuries.
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The action had triggered national conceptions.
The 21-year-old had raped Anne Boyysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The view of the young people was so curious that the caregivers and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted during the process to be in a bar at night with booys.
He was also able to beat her and rape her, but he argues to be responsible for the girl's death.
The police were first out of several cases, but two suspects were released from prison because the evidence against them was not sufficient.
The public prosecutor also stressed during the procedure that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Violence in South Africa is almost daily: There are about 64 000 ads a year because of sexual violence.
These are almost ten times as many as in Germany, but with 82 million people who have significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa value the dark figures for sexual violence, but on the 10-to 25-fold.
Jumbo visits the black forest ham
Jumbo looking for the "best ham of the world": The Pro7-star Bondorf visited the TV broadcast "Galleo".
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: the most important for the ham are the pigs, Turbomast is not a good condition.
Can hams, which you get in every supermarket, be a quality product?
Uli as head of the big ham factory in the Black Forest explains Jumbo's "Adler" way of working in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favorite ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and kittel comes into the interior of the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands for the first time before he can take the micro.
Viewed Jumbo for boosting fast limbis in Woodshut
"Here I have a great deal of work here," said the Fernese-maker, Schinken Black Forest as a mass product.
16,000 cells per week speak for themselves.
Weight, Fat Part, Color: Uli explains what it gets at the quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered for six months.
TV with level?
Details such as the ph-value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph-value.
"I'm excited when you measure Roberto Blanco, what happens then," says Jumbo in Chinese.
The level of private television in pure culture is presented here.
But the look is worth it anyway.
The viewer sees that the decommissioning of the cells is still handwork.
Because: Black forest hamken is traditionally found without bones in the regal.
The secret of the ham is the confectionery with salt.
Smoke tower and smoke fire remind Jumbo visually of a "U-boot".
The trick: Dance branches here provide in the smoke for the special taste of the black forest of Schinkens.
20 days of smoking make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc in the jumbo disappears," he announces the test feed.
"It's really nice," said the TV star's fait.
This will enable all participants to live.
Did you think travel offices belong to the Internet of the past?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects record revenues from vacationers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now accounts for an adjusted annual tax profit of between $325 million and $340 million, compared to $305 to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current target values are achieved, this means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record earnings of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved eight percent in the first half of the year and booked a strong start in the second half of the year, especially in the Australian and British private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are in a good way towards record-year revenue before interest and taxes," he explained.
These include Australia and the United Kingdom, which typically belong to our strongest results.
In Australia, the leisure sector has recovered in the second half of the year, which shows a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, it was good for the holiday business of Flight Centre in Great Britain, while here the business customers also spent less.
The US business recovered from the slower first half of the season, so a profit is expected for the third year as a result.
The shares of the Flight Centre increased by 3 cents yesterday to $38.20.
Schools are held to a greater focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students will have to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th - century novel, romantic lyric and contemporary British novels since 1914.
The test also includes "invisible texts" input to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished.
From 2015 onwards, students will have to pass a separate GCSE examination for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curriculums for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core areas will be amended next year.
In a separate initiative, Offqual, the supervisory authority for examinations, will announce a new organisation of the GCSE structures, including a new system of use and less course work.
In a summer speech, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is a "wide consensus that we need to reform our testing system in order to restore public confidence", stressing that the GCSEs would become "more challenging, ambitious and stringent".
Studies show that less time is spent in English schools for mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach on average 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the hour plan, from coalition circles it means that the comprehensive math test – combined with a stronger weighting of the specialist in ranking lists – will probably encourage schools to spend more hours.
The teaching plan focuses more on "the problems of the right life", including financial matters.
Lovely animals and delicious cakes
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colors present the circle performance show this weekend in the civil house.
The evaluations were already carried out on Thursday
The local association W514 is redesigning this large exhibition.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Discussion Forum
At the next Ecumenical Discussion Forum on Monday, October 21st, in the New Museum of the Castle, it is the theme "To Hell with Hell - Theological Discussions for Today's Behavior with the Last Things".
Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Church Communities Salem, the Palace Salem and the Cultural Office of the Land Seekreis.
Johanna Rahner wants to look into the forum of the question, as people today step into the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much of it in the past centuries and put on those pictures of heaven and hell, "who have marked our ideas to this day", then the contemporary prophetic teaching of the hopes of fulfillment is more marked by a certain privilege or even languagelessness.
"The greater hope has been driven out Christians and Christians by religious criticism," says the rapporteur.
It has "supplied us with so many questions that we seem to have the call marks".
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the crucial challenge remains the problem of death."
This is linked to the question of that desire, "which dreams that everything will be good at the end."
Johanna Rahner, born 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic Theology and Biology from 1982 to 1989 at Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg.
She promoted Dr. theol in 1997, also in Freiburg.
The qualification for fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the West Fälische Wilhelms-University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has taught systematic theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology of the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Little Heuberg confirm their faith at the firming
In two services 101 15- and 16-year-old young people of the mental care unit At Kleinen Heuberg were established.
In the morning the group Laudato-Si accompanied the service, in the afternoon of the Youth Choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the firmament, the young men said yes to their baptism and embraced the power of the Holy Spirit.
The firm members had prepared themselves in the past months, under the leadership of Diakon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous members of the community on the big day of the holiday.
In various projects, they met various tasks of the Christian community and shared their youth in sub - Saharan Africa.
Illmensee: 2nd Mountain Bike Racing Enthusiastic Participants
At great weather, 214 bikers came to Illmensee to manage the round course over the hills around the lake.
This is shared by Ulrich Knobel from the sporting association Illmensee.
The participants included, in particular, at a short distance of more than 15 kilometres and 300 meters high, also a number of everybody's radars who once wanted to practice their hobby in a competitive atmosphere.
Two senior German top-class riders were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Forestsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of good positions in the German Championships.
Both of these could be expected to leave the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a little time to the goal and defend his title as a total winner of the short distance.
In place two were able to re-place Pascal Treubel.
Among the ladies was Theresa Duelli from the team's Albreum, who made it on top of the winner's stage.
In place two and three Anne Adel came from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen.
A happy development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of the capacity for performance, the whole band was represented by athletes.
The age structure also ranges from ten years in the youngest to more than 70 years in the oldest beginners.
In the main race this year there were even more absolute topats at the start.
Four drivers were able to stop from the regional top drivers.
Among them is Philipp Pangerl, a Mountainbike semi-professional from the Black Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl, together with a teammate, was already a world champion twice in the 12-hour profession.
This year he became a European champion in this special discipline.
This includes Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls himself two German masters in Duathlon.
After 45 kilometres and 900 meters of height, it reached a firefighting finish in the finish line in front of the three-seas hall.
Pangerl was the first one on the target line.
Only a second later, the Routinier Ballerstedt was able to secure the second place in the overall rating.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann became the third party of the overall evaluation.
In the ladies' evaluation, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race.
The second place was the Areane Blersch from Binzwang in front of Natasha Werner from Stuttgart.
Sportsmen and helpers were very pleased with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
Roads through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical help to isolated villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country, there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him as "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years George Bwelle watched his sick father lose consciousness and travel to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but then there was a inflammation that spread on his brain and caused a hematoma that should affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded hospitals and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer there.
“It’s not easy,” comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and it's not the first.
There are many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has barely changed since Bwell's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, so the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonis could not visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three quarters of the health expenditure in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle says.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his countrymen suffered to see in Bwelle the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team have carried out 700 free operations last year.
He was himself a doctor and worked as a nurse at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also established a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels on weekends in rural areas and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday he and up to 30 people in small buses and ride with the narrow medical equipment on the roof over unassembled terrain into the villages that need help.
It doesn't always go smoothly.
They had to move the vehicles more than once through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will receive them as heroes: a feast, a song, and a dance, and the best accommodation to offer the place.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason for celebration and bwelle – with its broad smile and its limitless energy – is a pleasure at the happy celebration.
The next morning the team will then start investigating hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," said Bwelle.
They come from a circumference of 60 kilometers around the village – and the one at foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others are receiving crayons, scattered glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is necessary for the school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team conducts simple operations with local stunning.
The operations usually take place in a school, a home or an apartment; after the intervention, the patients stand up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is fed by the group generator and thus Bwelle and his volunteers work until early morning hours on Sunday.
It's an intense pensum, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"They have been drumming all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work," Bwelle says.
On Sunday the team then returns to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free operations in the last year and knows that with its work it makes a huge difference for the people it helps.
One man explained that the free operation of a profit breach that he had received would now be possible for him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital, Bwelle also works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night.
With this second job, it finances 60% of its non-profit activity, as Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's asleep," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying at the Drexel University in Philadelphia Medicine and volunteering in Bwelles Group in the second year.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and health care students such as O'Malley, who come from the USA and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gather practical experiences that they would never get home.
"We can be in operations where we help to drain blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley explains.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated health care.
But if they are only once in Yaoundé, Bwelle will take over accommodation, transportation and instructions.
"He is certainly a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people, knows no limits.
For Bwelle, the almost continuous work is not a burden.
To help others to live a happier life and to fulfill a promise that he has given to his father is a great joy for him.
"I am so happy when I do this work," Bwelle says.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to bring people back to laughter and to ease the pain.

Excellent battle mastered
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's Novelle "The old man and the sea", Horst Janson was cut to pieces.
Janson himself is an old hare in his metaerium, the art of acting.
The old man Santiago can't make anything when fishing.
This is how the two simply complement each other.
You almost think you can see the flaws in the old man's neck, of which the fisherman boy Manolo speaks.
When Santiago is tired of living on the chair, it's real at Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson excels.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who did not give up and finally won the fight against the fish by his knowledge and will.
Janson is on stage as a solo manufacturer in a wide range.
He manages to focus the public's attention on himself, so that his monologues are not a moment of trouble.
His efforts to draw the fish finally to the surface of the water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea consists only of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann let the old man act in the boat before the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he puts the active scene in the light of each: the cottage of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, which with her songs and her wonderful voice captures Cuba's feeling of life.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: Going to the Romans
At about 120 meters of length below Cologne, a sewer can be obtained from the Roman era.
Whoever visits Cologne doesn't come by the dome.
Around 157 meters the two towers reach the sky and make it the second largest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who view the two Philippine church towers recognize that there is also a lot to discover under the dome.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne Underworld.
The meeting point for his tours is the service centre of Cologne-Tourism directly at the Dom.
The tour begins quite unspectacular: "We start in the underground garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a self-righteous city, so only the rest of the old city walls remained standing, which was not too big.
This is why most of the users of the park house continue to pass on to the rest of the Roman and only drop off their car.
But who looks more closely, in the park deck D2 discovers an archaeological site separated by metal casting rods.
There are about five meters high ruins made of hand-held stones.
"There are remnants of the Roman city walls built after Christ in the second half of the first century," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to the daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the top level take a look at a window, 15 meters deep drawer.
This is the source of the old dome, which unfortunately is hardly perceived.
The next station of the roundabout is the Pretoria, and here the participants go back down into the depth.
Here we experience the office of the once powerful man north of the Alps, the Prefect of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippapinension", which means as much to good German as "City of the Roman Right and City of the Agrippapiners, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the emperor cult".
And in the Prefecture it is the former palace of the State, the power centre of the Roman Empire at the Rhine.
From the premises of the exhibition, a tunnel leads to the Roman river basin, which is maintained at about 120 meters long.
"You can quietly get a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," the school gets the guests up.
There's still a surprise.
After holding the key on the box, he leads the group to a 16-metre deep, passable box.
"We are now in the mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to reach the base water that was indispensable for ritual washing.
To this day, at the lower end of the mikwe, whose origins go back to the eighth century, different water standings are possible through changing peaks of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the site of the town hall for which construction works are to begin in the short term.
Until completion, however, a few more years will pass.
Almost hacked leg: Retrieval of Rocker process
A blood attack in the rock environment is re-rolled after more than four years.
A process of attempted killing, dangerous bodily injury and injury to two 30-year-olds has begun before the Frankfurt (or) Land Court.
It is accompanied by strict security procedures.
The defendants were forced to proceed.
They were supposed to have been active in the rock scene and were then part of the bandidos.
In June 2009, the Public Prosecutor proposed that three men in a car, together with unknown complicities in Finowfurt, have entered and entered a car.
All the victims were severely injured, a man would have almost lost his leg.
The victims should have been part of the competing Hells Angels group.
One should have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
Precisely, it was a hunting hunt with several cars.
According to the prosecution, it was a revolution and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants were released in early 2012 in a first procedure.
At the time, a judge said that it was not possible to prove that the men were actually involved in the bloody herd.
The perpetrators wore masks and were not recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof raised the judgment after the Court of Justice’s review and referred it back to the Court of Justice for a re-negotiation.
One of the defendants is currently guilty of another crime in the open execution.
The start was mainly about the reconstruction of the events in the night.
As a witness, the investigating commissioner was then charged.
In the center were telephone conversations of the accused and other persons who had been arrested by the police.
It is difficult for Rocker to hold to a law of honor before the court - and not to say it.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims had been unpacked.
Public prosecutor Stefan Golfier from the Frankfurt (Oder) Public Prosecutor said on request that there have been new traces since the last procedure.
Eleven further negotiating days are set up for the process.
The casting company does not think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but sometimes it goes home.
Only: In the beds of the people on the sidewalk and back seat, the hunger becomes noticeable.
Of course, you may be responsible for some cocktail or sect!
What's closer to driving to the next drive-in to get a little something?
I admit, I'm happy to be with you when it comes to fast food in the morning or early morning.
A couple of tomatoes, a cola, a burger - and then nothing like home and bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco gangs are noticeable.
Because what needs to be missing is that you regularly throw your fast food bags out of the car window?!
Above all, on weekends, discarded paper bags are located on street corners and parking spaces.
"Well?" I ask.
Are the people too deaf to take the babies home with them, respectively, to the next miller?
It's not just that the paper material changes the landscape.
Kills have already covered transport facilities such as guideboards and caused accidents.
About what she thought she said, "Wegwerfsgesellschaft" but she probably doesn't even know what this word means.
If you are on your way in the evening, just with several people in the car, you know how a backbank can look after spent nights: stickers, bottles and other garbage are drowned there.
There would be a few tissues more or less but nothing - unlike the road, where no one wants to eat on the rest of other rooms.
I see the day coming when the cities and communities will bleed out of the pit - and the fast food chains will have to demand for their grandchildren.
Obama Back in Health Policy
After intense criticism, President Obama made yesterday a returnee repeat his frequent, clear promise: “If you like your health insurance, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers have received a letter of notice, the Republicans have proposed to the President in the last days that he has deceived the American public.
yesterday Obama relativized his original promise.
"The overwhelming majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep them," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports about the announcements, Obama called on those Americans who received such messages to take care of themselves on the free market after a new insurance.
Most citizens could receive better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or cheaper than predicted.
"They come up with a better offer," he said.
The government said it was a little surprising that the five percent of the population that themselves had concluded insurance had to cover at another rate, as their contract did not meet the new standards according to the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say to these Americans directly that you have earned better," said Sebelius at a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, explained that the start of the online platform has been "miserable" since October.
"I'm just as frustrated and angry as all the others," she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
This statement made by Sebelius to a consultant behind her sitting at the hearing in the representative's house was taken up after a discussion with the Republican member Billy Long from Missouri. It was about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeated the question why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily refuse a state-funded insurance to conclude a tariff at HealthCare.gov, which they now want to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Force Base
An American government official, who wanted to remain anonymous, claimed on Thursday against the US news broadcaster CNN that Israeli warplanes had attacked a gunpoint in Syria one day earlier.
The target was "Rakets and related equipment" from which the Israeli government feared that they were destined for the Lebanese Hisbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arab envoy Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the support point in the port city of Latakia was held in the night of Wednesday on Thursday, and Israel was responsible for it.
The Israeli TV channel 2 showed satellite images of the support point in Latakia, on which Russian anti-fighting rockets of type S-125 Newa were seen and a battery of SA-3 rockets, which according to channel 2 have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport jumpheads up to 70 kilograms.
The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the News Agency Reuters also cites an anonymous Israeli government officials with the words that he believes Israel has carried out the attack, but is not sure.
In any case, a speaker from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said, "We do not comment on these reports".
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already tried to deliver ground-air rockets to Hisbollah earlier, in part, successfully.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hisbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean exceeding a "red line" that would follow a military response.
John Kerry explains in an unparalleled statement that the US espionage has "extensively gone too far"
John Kerry pointed out with an unexpected insight that the United States 'disobedience' in relation to its monitoring programmes, saying that in certain cases the espionage was 'too far away'.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs added that he and Barack Obama had the responsibility of switching to "Autopilot" when the explosive revelations of the Whistleblower Edward Snowden about the spy activities of the NSA became public.
Through the information provided, the U.S. government has entered into a diplomatic storm of equipment on the part of its allies.
Kerry said in a speech transmitted by video to the Open Government Conference in London: “The president and I, as well as others in the government, have experienced some things that are almost by autopilot, simply because the ability to go back to World War II and the difficult years of Cold War and of course on September 11th.”
He then joined the U.S. government as the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government that the U.S. Spionage has exceeded a limit, but also stressed that rights have not been misused.
He said: "In some cases this has gone far too far."
The President is determined to create clarity and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one must have the feeling that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process will not be undermined.
Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA be a force of good and that many lives were saved through its monitoring processes.
He added: “We have to do with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is about to kill people, blow up the air and attack governments.
So what if you were able to capture and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the killing of people because we have experienced such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to address the concerns of the alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the US in anti-terrorism efforts, as stated by the chairman of the Senate Committee on European Affairs on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he spoke this week with representatives of the European Parliament and others and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organisations due to frustration over monitoring by the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism," Murphy, who for the first time sits in the Senate and is chaired by the Senate's Committee on External Relations and European Affairs, explained in an interview in Washington.
I am also going to Europe to make it clear there that we need to continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their concerns over the NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe have charged relationships with some US allies, although the head of the secret service this week declared the reports to be irrelevant and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from documents transmitted by Snowden, whereby the NSA monitored the phone of Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The leader of the national secret services, James Clapper, defended the espionage with allies as necessary and explained that this was common on both sides.
In all the Tumult, Murphy, his authority was preparing for the congress to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other Members participating will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact route is still being developed.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some "nearest words".
He said that the European governments should be honest with their people about the type of spying programmes they have been using for years.
"Although we can change our monitoring programmes and better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to find that we are not the only ones who spy on them," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on his weekend trip to the Middle East and to Poland to get involved there with the role of the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US monitoring activities.
A heartbreaking injury to the jump ring threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the FSV Mainz 05 FC Augsburg outdoors game.
Mainz is responsible for the use of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he could only do it individually.
"We will decide on his use in the short term," said Coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best shot with six hits.
Because the mains have already to ignore the injured performers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australia is calling for prison sentences in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in Phuket prison because she had falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver, filed an appeal against the verdict and was released on bail.
Steve Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 for having made a false statement after she had told the Thai police, a local taxi driver raped her in the morning of Sunday, June 10th, while two other men arrested her.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that she was sure to arrive at her hotel after she was separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she was able to consider the story.
Until the trial, she was on the scene in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a prison with a low level of security on the edge of Phukets, instead of a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former Australian Ruby League player who has turned to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about the well-being of his daughter and wanted to have her back in Australia.
"We are of course very concerned, but we hope that she will be home as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford has filed an appeal against the verdict and is against a bail of 50,000 Baht on a free foot.
In Australian reports it was to read that she was vacationing in the holiday resort Krabi in South Thailand.
The Court’s comments were to be heard, Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher penalty of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that after the recent murder of the travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand could try to improve its targeted tourist image, and that is why it comes to a free trial.
