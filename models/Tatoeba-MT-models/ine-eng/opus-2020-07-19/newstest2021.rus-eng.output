I want to contact all political commentators, politicians, participants in every show.
The people of the Habarrows should not be demonized.
This is where the people who are in love and remarkable people live, and Mikhail Dechterev is divided.
In an interview, Dechtierev recalled that he was a member of the LDPR and a partner of Furgal and added that he wanted success in the court, and that the party and personally Vladimir Girinovski would support the court.
The full text of the interview was published on KP.ru.

Semilarically against the prosecutor's office: the cassation of the former Deputy Mayor of Tartu will be considered on 4 August
This means that it is likely to be decided in early September.
The courts of the first two courts refused to consider the claim of Semilarski, but in April his cassation complaint was brought before the State Court.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the complainant, as it was not authorized by the Administrative Court.
The Court ruled that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for the damage caused during criminal proceedings.
“Regulatory matters should be handled by the Public Prosecutor’s Office and the Court of Justice”, explained earlier to the correspondent of the ERR Press Secretary of the Tartu Court, Annette Creatsmann.
She said that Valvo Semilarski had appealed to this order in the district court, which on 5 February had not changed the judgment of the Court of First Instance.
Now he will have to say his word.
According to the defender of Semilarski, a sworn lawyer, Oliver Neaes, his client was unwarrantedly suspected of bribery for about two years.
He now demands the prosecutor ' s office to reject the false allegations and to compensate him for his moral damage.
In October 2017, Samilarski, together with the others, was detained by the Deputy Mayor of Tartu Artem Sowrow on suspicion of several crimes.
“I recall that when I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the Tartu leaders, one of the most influential local authorities, were sold.
Those airtight public suspects accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have become false, the prosecutor's office has nothing to say about it," Samilarski commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Neaes, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework at the press conference in which the prosecutor was required to operate.
"The claim of bribes and sales has proved false, but this is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, repeatedly stressed in its decisions on Russia and Lithuania that at the time of the investigation, representatives of the State should be cautious in choosing words so that suspects would not be represented in the role of criminals prior to the conviction.
The prosecutor's office also committed the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not respected in this case against Valvo Semilarski," Niaes said.
“The public representation of Semilarski as a serious offender and receiver in circumstances where facts based on suspicion in the recipient are still not acceptable, contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the applicant”, added the lawyer.
As Rus.err.ee wrote, the former Deputy Mayor of Tartu Valvo Semilarski would not be held liable for the charge of bribery - the criminal case brought against him in July was partially closed.
At the same time, the former officer is accused of deliberately violating anti-corruption legislation in the conduct of transactions of particular sizes.
According to the indictment, from 2015 to 2017, the former Deputy Mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in the city administration meetings in making decisions related to existing Tartu companies, with owners or managers of whom Semilarski was actively involved at the personal level at the outside time.
According to Gross, in all these cases, Semilarski had personal interests and therefore had to be excluded from the decision-making process.
Earlier, as wrote by Rus.err.ee, the Public Prosecutor's Office filed Semillar suspicions of receiving bribery and violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions in particular large sizes.
This happened in October 2016 when he was arrested together with another Deputy Mayor, Artem Sowrow (Centrist Party).
At that time, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office and the Security Police stated that there was strong evidence against both Vice-Chairmen.
After that, both officers resigned.
Suvorov's case was later brought before a court that had fully justified the policy.
The judicial review of the Valvo Semilarski case is still ongoing.

How the CB's decision to reduce the key rate affects the economy
We're waiting for the bank of Russia to lower the key rate again.
It is still 0.25 per cent, up to 4.25 per cent of the annual formal historical minimum.
According to the return of a short rate reduction, as well as the tonality of the CB statements and updated forecasts on the Russian economy, the regulator looks at economic prospects more optimistic than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary policy mitigation can soon be stopped.
"We have continued to mitigate monetary policy, especially since the risks of inflation decline remain below 4 per cent in 2021," said Bank of Russia head Elvira Nabiulin.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, a fall in domestic and external demand.
The recovery of the economy, according to Nabiullin, will take more than half a year.
It noted, however, that, following the removal of the restrictions resulting from the pandemic, economic processes had been restored: energy consumption, consumption and investment demand, increased construction and issue of consumer goods, slowed annual traffic reduction, and production.
According to the CBC, the reduction in the economy in 2020 will be 4.5-5.5% (4-6 per cent expected) and the recovery growth in the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5 per cent, 2.5-3.5 per cent in 2022.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the annual oil prices forecast to $38 and $40 for Urals barrel in 2020 and 2021 respectively.
Previously, the CB was expecting $27 and $35 for the barrel.
Finally, the Russian Bank's 2020 inflation forecast was 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view of the situation in the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the mitigation cycle, they consider economists on Russia and the CIS Renesance Capital Sofia Donez and Andrei Melaštenko.
Yes, the Bank of Russia has consistently reduced the key rate for more than a year, and since the beginning of last summer it has dropped by 3.5 per cent.
At the last meeting in June, the CB immediately reduced it to one percentage point due to low inflation rates due to the sudden demand and the need to stimulate the slowed by the pandemic and associated constraints of the economy.
The chances of setting up monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on 18 September and by the end of the year), but the border is already close, agreed by the chief analyst, Rosbank Evgenie Koschelev.
The pool of inflation risks also indicates the proximity of the break in the reduction of the percentage policy - broken supply chains, the possible increase in costs due to prevention measures and the faster recovery of demand (compared to expectations), he said.
In conclusion, the Bank of Russia will need more attention to inflation processes during the harvest season, as well as the external volatility that has increased in the face of geopolitical conflicts, Koschelev points out.
Thus, a decrease in the key rate would result in a further reduction in the rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as perhaps in the mortgage, said the senior economist of the Open Bank analyst Maxim Petronovic.
The adjustment of rates would be less pronounced than the reduction of the key rate, he specified.
Need credit rates may fall to another 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, the mortgage rates may end in the range of 6.2-7 per cent, without excluding the economy of Anton Pokatovic, BCS Primer.

The authorities of the Sub-Moscow told about the fate of closed landfills
In Sub-Moscow, solid household waste sites continue to be closed.
This year, the authorities have promised to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 landfills are modernized in modern waste-processing facilities.
But this option is not possible for each polygon, many of which have been raised by a flat housing.
After the polygon is closed, it stands for recuperation - the body of the polygon is resuspended by ground, the degasation and removal systems are installed.
This allows the chemical processes to be stopped inside the garbage, so that it does not burn out, or that it does not cause harm, and that it does not poison soil and groundwater.
And then the ex-con keeps raising a useless dog in the middle of her living room.
Why don't you do something useful?
For example, in Russia, where the recuperation of the Annanian field was literally completed in the days, the authorities consider making the dog a gorilla.
This polygon, which was operated from 1976 to 2016, grew so that it went beyond the boundaries of its land.
Therefore, in the case of recuperation, neighboring sites had to be purchased, which had long been killed by a mosquito under siege.
"Sometimes will pass, the polygon will wait, the fortress will rise, and we'll think what we can do to get it started.
Directly thrown into the eye - a mountain resort," told reporters in the head of the Russian district of Nikolai Parfenov.
Two polygons will become renewable energy recovery sites
The "Torbeevo" sites in Lubercah and "Timohovo" in the Bogorod district will become sites for renewable energy from freshwater and biological gases.
Torbeeva will be launched by the end of the year by a gas station capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatts of electricity per year and about 0.95 gigacalities of heat that will provide its own needs for the polygonal supply of administrative and production facilities.
“Timochovo” will produce 72.5 million kilowatt hours and will continue as a garbage processing plant.

There are some who believe, there are some hypocrites, there are some hypocrites, and some who are allegorical.
The believer in the categories of civilization will not think.

And to a believer everywhere in prayer.

The prayer of the believer is not but from a place from which they pray.
He is the one who believes, and is not unconcerned.
We're snakes, not rocks.
