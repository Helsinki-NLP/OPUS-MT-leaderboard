The triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, in total, is 29 percent
A significant weakening of the two parties of the former Great Coalition and a significant strengthening of the law-enforcement parties led to the first preliminary parliamentary elections from Sunday to Sunday in Austria.
In particular, the Austrian People's Party (OPV) suffers losses, where the position of former President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously at stake.
On the contrary, the head of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Kärntner Landeshauptmann Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphal return to federal policy.
According to the previous results, social democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest in the country with 29.8% of the votes, compared to the last elections in 2006, but it loses 5.5% of the votes.
It is even worse to cut down the GDP, which loses almost nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the history of the Austrian post-war, and especially in the People's Party which requested the elections to be held, this is a truly catastrophic result.
At the beginning of July, when the EVP had emerged from the coalition, the People's Party had a clear advantage over the SPÖ.
The voters, however, have probably punished the party for failing the government.
In the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about the possible resignation of the Chairman and former Vice-Chairman Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case at an extraordinary meeting of the Management Board on Monday.
Such a development would probably pave the way for the most likely exit from the electoral debacle, i.e. a renewal of the large coalition from SPÖ and OVP.
In view of the strengthening of the two law-enforcement parties - the Liberals (FPÖ) received 18 per cent, the BZÖ received 11 per cent of the votes - the Social Democrats gave an expression at the same time of their fear that 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party with the populist talks (at that time the FPÖ was still unanimous, in 2005 it had separated itself from the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which even led to sanctions on the part of the European Union.
It is obvious that Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with each party and to move from a return to Vienna to the Austrian Federal Policy.
In addition, the Green Party, however, suffered slight losses and was withdrawn from the third in fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four-percentile and therefore did not join Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists charged in India because of the illegal collection of cages, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg may find it a certain cooling of the Czech-India relations.
This was highlighted by the Minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clear, then be sure, it will come to a certain degree of cooling," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks, in judicial matters the executives could only take a difficult step.
Nevertheless, he pointed out that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the prosecution and received a fine, the central government wants to deal with the local government in Dardjiling, in whose case the case falls.
"His problem could be solved," said the Minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years' imprisonment, Mukherdshi's view would be the best if he went to trial at a higher court.
He could ask for bail and wait freely for his verdict, as the Minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had also expressed himself in negotiations.
"He recommends a call at a higher court, then a warrant for him comes up," said the chief of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to expose the convicted "competent legal support", the Indian minister suggested.
At the same time, he said that such help would already be offered by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians admit that too," Schwarzenberg pointed out.
At the same time, he confirmed the importance of the Czech press agency ČTK, in front of his partner, the Czech Republic, to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it is a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he explained.
One answer to the question whether he has received the commitment from the Indian side to deal with the matter is different from the Minister.
"I've already been promised quite a lot," he just noted.
A Czech directs the ring around the seabed
It comes up with an electronic map, illustrated on Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it also the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the thirty-headed team of UN Divisions for Oceans and Oceans.
His chief, the Director of Division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, pursues the interpretation and complements it.
Here is the rule of work and enthusiasm.
The seabed has so far produced only a few known worlds that are rich in natural sources.
Here is oil to be found, then urea and other non-growth raw materials, but also previously unknown living organisms, which carry the key to developing a drug against cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
Today, the countries of origin have reported their claim to the new maritime areas.
After a UN convention, they make use of their rights, to which they united themselves in Montego Bay in Jamaica in 1982.
It is particularly the area of the so-called continental peninsula, which often reaches up to a hundred kilometres from the shore of a country into the sea.
This country, in accordance with the Convention, has an exclusive claim to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simplicitly expressed as continental shale is considered the part of the seabed and its soles, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It exceeds the limits of the sea, often also the limits of two hundred miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the Commission to establish the external borders of the continental shelf must be based on extensive scientific and technical documentation, which is based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical support.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Up to now, only the three last-mentioned countries have succeeded," Mikulka added.
A short time ago, the success of Australia, which as the first country had been able to significantly expand its marine areas, was on an international echo.
However, New Zealand is also a winner - the extension of the seabed that was granted to the country last week by the Commission is approximately 1.6 million square kilometres, i.e. about six times the size of the State.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The future profit that comes to them from using the sea floor will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other States will also submit their requests gradually.
You can do this ten years from the moment they ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean supply, which is referred to by the Convention as "the common heritage of humanity", begins.
Then no state has a special position here.
The right to promote in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The sea floor, however, is not a gold minerland," he says with a slightly exaggerated director Mikulka and adds that "its individual areas are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored".
Czech in Pacific
Part of the seabed is also part of the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the Interoceanmetal Joint Organisation.
In 1991, it was awarded the status of a so-called "rail-breaker investor" by the Convention, as well as by the investors of a few less other states.
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is divided there, it's a kind of Tatra on the sea floor.
"You can go there on a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and mangan", says another lawyer, the Inder Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev Division brings such a concretion as a pattern.
It reminds of a small potato or, with some imagination, of the so-called scheme that has brought the legend after the Golem to life.
German Special Forces were on-site at Geisel release
The Egyptian government had asked for help to resolve the hostage crisis from Germany - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they did not come to use.
More and more details are being made known in the circumstances of liberation 11 in Egypt by European tourists.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also directly involved in the rescue operation.
Thus, both specialists in the Federal Defence and GSG 9 officials were the Flying Staff of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts of the Technical Aid Agency at the place of release.
However, as spokesmen of the ministries continued on Monday night, the German forces were not needed because the hostages left their prisoners and fled when they had recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the help offered by Germany to incorporate them as support forces on the ground.
"I'm glad it didn't come to this," said one speaker from the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
Attackers had taken the group from the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian, and eight Egyptian companions to southern Egypt on September 19.
After the expulsion into a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad were dragged away.
The identity of the hostages remained unclear until the last time, as was the details of the liberation or possible ransom payments.
The gears have now arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the free hostages were in the belly of the German message.
He did not comment on details of the release.
In Berlin, there was no information when they returned to Germany.
According to the "Picture" section, the five holidayers and the special forces are to be evacuated with an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Packages
The first chamber of the US Congress has almost lost the 700 billion dollars of the heavy rescue package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones burst into the depths.
With 206 votes to 227, the US House of Representatives rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals made by US President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the program to put chaos into the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the advocates had desperately tried to convince the critics of the 700 billion-dollar heavy package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called the MPs for an agreement, even though the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet occurred," he said.
Still during the vote, the Dow Jones broke in by more than six percent or 600 points.
There were reasons why investors were concerned that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, in order to rescind after the failure to acknowledge the failure.
Experts are now counting on the international financial markets with further heavy turbulence.
The agreement between the House of Representatives and the Senate is necessary for the entry into force of the programme.
Organizers list increasing bookings
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
In the case of travel bookings for the coming months, sales in comparison to the previous year have increased significantly, according to a study - even for the winter season by more than 30 percent.
Despite poor economic prospects, the journey of the Germans remains unencumbered according to a study.
In the winter bookings, the travel offices recorded a 31 per cent sales plus over the previous year, as announced by the German Travel Association (DRV) on Monday in Berlin.
According to the study of the GfK market research institute, there are already increased bookings for the autumn months.
Thus, the sales plus of the travel offices for October amounted to about 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV reported.
The basis for these results is the figures of the GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel offices and rises for the whole market.
The travel bookings were recorded by the end of August 2008.
Due to the low dollar rate, particularly travel to the United States was requested, the DRV shared.
This is about a third of the booking growth.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic fields of the Germans, were particularly requested destinations.
In particular, the course was high, DrV President Klaus Laepple explained.
In view of the rising costs for energy and food, here the costs are "better calculated for customers than for the individual organised holiday".
Consumers could save money through early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, said Laepple.
The summer months have also been very well booked, so that there will be a sales plus again compared to the previous year - although according to another study the number of Germans who took a trip fell compared to the previous year.
My First Day of October
Ballermann-Apres-Ski hits in the finish line, beer made from litres and promises in designer-Dirndln.
A Wiesn Debüt.
Susanne Kronsucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is blonde, TV moderator and wears a tailor-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing connects us: almost three minutes on the meadows, the photographers are already crashing on us and cutting the memory cards completely - very funny and that on my first visit to the meadows.
That's how you make friends.
The Bill-Dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
As a Wiesn-Tourist and actually located in the north of the White Wharve Square, the feeling of well-being remained within reach until now.
But once you arrived on the terrace, it's all half that bad.
Almost everyone wears dorsal or leather pants; no eye directed or painfully touched - everything is completely normal.
Strange views at the chocolate stand only exudes my gut shorts.
A nun reminds me that I would have wrongly bound the shorts: "Links hoast free, mid-wife, forgive right, reverse white."
Heavenly, I am holding back the loops from the back to the left.
"Pass," he said and laughed.
Others make less effort to subtle flirting techniques and wear simple filter gloves on which "To drink to get dressed!" stands and stretches an unscrupulous side against the naked back.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is called Bob, who comes from England and also visits the October party for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long drawn "oooo".
He tells me this after he has released his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of these hydrants, from which everyone thinks he's a mulley.
So Bob's one of those so-called "Wildbeisler".
Others do not have the chance to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, healthy people will walk in the shed over the place where they will have to take care of the poor swallows.
The nurses always appear in the wheelchair - every four at once drag a covered load from tent to tent.
It works like with most Wiesn visitors: empty away, completely back.
Whoever's in the Promille Sarg is under the plan, you can't see it.
"These are the ones that pack goarnimmers," one of the sanitizers called me on request and disappeared in the dust.
Name of the accident victim reported by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in a hospital after being attacked by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, resident in the Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon at the Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romeford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of the suspicion of easy driving.
In the meantime, he was released on bail.
Turkey expands the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey tried to join the European Union, the European authorities were interested in bringing deep into Turkey's background.
On the east side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, is one of the finest relics of this broken, imperial effort.
The Hydarpasha Railway Station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo Renaissance style.
At least that's what the tour guide tells you.
The building sits at the end of the train path with a tower on each corner of the front and thus looks like any provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is falling apart.
But once you're inside the waved ticket switch, there's no doubt about the propriety of the project, whose most western access was.
The train station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolian-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a late in the imperialist game, had to implement its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
However, the imperialist plans of Germany took place during the first world war.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence by Arabs and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, created by the unsurpassed limits of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces expelled from Egypt and forced the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there were also bad news for the Hyderpasha Train Station.
In 1917, a ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the artificial roof.
Turkish sources say it was a Saturday.
Since then it has slowly collapsed, largely passed through history.
Today, however, this railway serves at least symbolically as a gateway to Anatolia and all east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Tukei.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the ACP, has introduced a huge new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, created by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
A policy of approach now prevails.
Significantly, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian split groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq, and with the European Union and the United States of America, of course.
In order to be able to assess the facts of this new foreign policy, I have made the night trip to the Turkish capital of Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a helpful ride on bricks that produced the same pace of the old world in the well-known documentation "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which will be viewed as a new city, for the new world state project to turn the back of the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, known for its Islamic origins, represents a paradigm change in the Turkish unity
This has triggered some mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi brought me to the AKP headquarters, a specially designed, ultra-modern stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-complete shopping centers and buttons in which middle managers, both men and women, met to complete the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-law politician from almost every other political party in Europe.
Pull, Krawatt, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The Cold War was an exception," he tells me.
Turkey was cut off from its back country.
Today, she has to look east and west at the same time.
There wasn't either one or the other.
She had to do both of them.
"But surely Turkey could at some time," I asked, "must be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "doesn't want to make this decision."
He then raised a point that almost everyone I spoke to here said almost routinely: Turkey's relations, not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, in the transferred sense, Europe can drive as a whole towards Asia and the Middle East as a whole on even railway tracks.
Back at Hydarpashas Train Station, after another night of largely sleepless sleep, I thought of these two German masters, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had seen this construction 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, too far, lie in Turkey's hands.
And when I was waiting for the ferry to return to the Bosporus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At the same time, there seemed to be little doubt about the continent that should have a claim on this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Chor.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus the following year.
He was thought of young people up to 21 years of age, but when the choir in 1979 for the last time was some of us at the end of 20 years - we just refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape changer) stood for the readiness and ability of the choir to attack any piece of music presented to him, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical diversity of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and stood alone thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that he never left behind over years.
How often death kept us "to let the music speak for itself".
He kept saying, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So it sings!"
His kind of leadership was absolutely clear and precise, but never did it take too long.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded even higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any leader was to be beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years, I have written criticisms for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by one - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He rejected the leaders who, according to his words, simply went "homed with one or two known sheep victims in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your reference to William Woodruff (September 25,), you write that "he resumed teaching economic history in Oxford in 1946 and in 1950 received a Hoblon-Norman research scholarship ... while studying at the same time for a BSc, a MA and a doctoral degree.
This is a conclusion from an author's comment in Woodruff's book "Alsoside of Nab End", however it does not agree.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University and during this time he wrote a doctoral work on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published as "The British rubber industry" in 1958.
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 on the course of a Hoblon Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to miss this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Philological Faculty.
`I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino `Flemenco and Life' because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They made me pay attention to them because of their flexibility and because of the power they emit, as they always treat the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magic moments.'
Second round of outstanding sales at Honda.
In November, Honda begins marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior, this large space limousine offers even a much larger one.
This includes the technical features that make it possible to save even more comfortable driving and fuel.
Changes before the forthcoming revolution.
So is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz shows a similar line to its predecessor, the changes that have been made to this large limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics should be highlighted.
However, before you begin to analyze the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda was able to renew this model for a short time compared to the other manufacturers.
Although the Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon that concerns its sale on the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where Jazz is the most sold car in 2002 and also in 2008.
After Jazz appeared on the market, about a million models were sold alone in Japan.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase the sale of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83 000 jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates run on 10,000 cars. This is 17% of the expected growth in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, since 2002, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazz models, which are 6.7% of the total sales in Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the managers of the branches in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 Jazz models per year.
More precisely, it allows the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model to obscure the sales gap in Spain.
In fact, the market leaders hope to complete the year with total sales of 22,000 models. These are 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this sales growth, Honda has increased its market share in Spain compared to the previous year (1.6%) to 1.8%.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda places on the appearance of a new model.
It is an insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters long, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200 000 models a year around the world.
According to the market estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50 % of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
The appearance of insight on the market is for the first month of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
In terms of the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimetre), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimetre) and the distance between the axles is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has grown 5 centimetre.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility programme and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, to a solution that was also used in the early jazz model.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a double load system, also reaches up to 339 litres, which is 19 litres larger than the capacity of the first generation.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 litre petrol engine, as the capacity of the Honda Jazz trunk with a 1.2 litre petrol engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, except for additional equipment such as leather seats or the possibility of creating a panoramic window, improved access to the seats will be offered.
The opening angle of the rear doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 performances of the petrol engines: 1,2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, excellent technical performance, while at the same time providing high torque performance for the entire engine life.
The first variant of 1.2 litres achieves the performance of 90 PS at 6 000 spins with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 PS - has 5.3 litres of petrol consumption and a CO2 output of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine, which reached 83 PS at the previous generation, it is now able to reach 100 PS.
The jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litre of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'Auto-Biene' avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of the technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was allowed to be inspired by nature this time, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot, whose flight goes back to the coarse behavior of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from the technical development centre of Nissan Motor Co. have developed these small robots in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology at the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director of Technology-PR and R&D Brand Management, the BR23C is an extension of the four-dimensional Nissan security shield.
This robot should ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds up its own, oval-shaped flygraum, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the fact-findings of the bees that can see over an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which allows them to fly uninterruptedly in their personal airspace without interruption.
In order to reflect the Rundum perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
He notices obstacles that are located in front of the BR23C at a distance of up to two meters and are in the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a bordered microprocessor, which is translated directly into a signal to avoid collision
At the moment when the obstacle is observed, the small robot will copy the bee flight and immediately change the direction by turning its wheels around 90o or even larger angle to avoid collision.
The greatest difference to any other system is that this exchange manoeuvre is absolutely instinctive.
If not, then the robot could not react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,' explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the leading engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot can neither go up nor down, but can not cross; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in the infinite way that it does the bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions to avoid collisions by the small robot.
`This device requires only a few seconds to process the information and act on these data.
It does not require either to store the information or the intuitive logic of the maneuvers performed, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of the storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in developing the technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology to introduce Nissan to the series cars in the next ten years.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are easier and longer than the diversity of lithium ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system through satellite to lead to the goal of driving and avoiding obstacles on the way.
She's at the center before she's loaded with a mortgage.
It must be seen that the US Ministry of Finance, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not without its own good.
Before the crisis and in order to prevent the U.S. citizens from developing mortgage stories of allegedly paying banks, an entertaining and informative game for Internet surfers was developed: `Bad Credit Hotel', it means.
Or maybe the 'Hotel of Bad Credits' or of the other.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to consider one, two and up to three times whether it is the moment to ask no credit.
And above all, where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
It certainly has useful information, but without details.
This is a page for teenagers rather than a place for all viewers.
What will happen when the game is expanded?
Well, if a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house.
Morgan Stanley provides its capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, a innovation that is due to a strong case of its stock exchange.
A week after a provisional agreement was made public, the two banks explained that MUFG 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's stock will be bought at a single price of $25.25, which represents a total amount of three billion dollars.
The price accepted is below 19% of the price of the share of 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares that will guarantee a 10% profit and can be resold at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley explained that the global business is being done on the basis of a single average price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28% above the current price.
However, the Morgan Stanley share fell against 17.00 GMT by 6.79% to $23.07.
"This strategic connection is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank," explained John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley has adopted this status last week, which will allow him to expand his business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Its connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been changed over the last few days: last Monday Morgan had just explained that it would sell up to 20% of its shares for about 8.5 billion dollars to Japan.
'One week ago', in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of the MUFG, 'we thought that the participation would consist entirely of tribal property.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and ensure ourselves.
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its price for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will be replaced by a reduction in profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that in one year, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into parent shares if the latter are exchanged within a given period of more than 50% above the sales value, i.e. about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable him to use investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his sales.
However, a press speaker in the group refused to make more precise information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a payment rate of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that his balance sheet had been down since the end of August `clear'.
The last few weeks were hard for the group, who had to watch their stock exchange rate decline by half, while the price for insurance against incapacity for payment was high.
This price went back on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other 'survivor' of the big investment banks on the Wall Street after the competition of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced that last week, 15 billion dollars, part of Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett, had been cancelled.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic re-establishes the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales, and of Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
Jener third was the one who, following the example of his peers and friends, put the plan of a new constitution to the vote this Sunday.
The mission met because, according to the public results on 80% of the voters' votes, 64% of the vote voted with `Yes'.
According to these results, 28% agreed with 'No', 7% of the electoral lists were invalid and 0.7% were given empty.
In order to adopt the draft Constitution, a vote must be reached more than half of all votes cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted on the outcome of the Wahllokale and a census of a non-governmental organization announced a clear victory for 'Yes', and 63% to 70% of the prophecy.
On the night of Sunday on Monday, Rafael Correa requested the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'constitution has triumphed in overwhelming ways', he had assured in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers south-west of Quito, and congratulated the Ecuadorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election held in silence under the observation of the Organization of the American States (OAS) referred to a text consisting of 444 points to ensure the 'new socialism' for which the President is employed.
The draft Constitution transfers the government to the economy by leaving it alone the right to "development planning" in a country that lives largely from the promotion of oil by foreign companies and from the currencies that send refugees to the country.
The project, which will be preceded by the 2006 Correa, will also provide the Head of State with more comprehensive power, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he is using this power and is seeking a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in that country with 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
Finally, it also intends to prohibit the presence of foreign troops, which will provide an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an equatorial stand as a starting point for American anti-drug interventions.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command began the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions, who were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who had been trapped in the desert for 11 days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon healthy and unharmed.
In the morning they were released from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the military stand at al-Maza directly next to Cairo International Airport at 3.30 p.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were brought directly, without being able to speak with the press, on board a helicopter to Maadi's hospital, a foreign district of Cairo, to be investigated there.
They enjoyed all the 'best health' and the kidnappers 'was not paid a ransom', Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna said on the roll.
After she was arrested on September 19 at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border region of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was again brought from 35 unknown exiles from a hiding place.
It is eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two leaders, four drivers, a border guard and director of the agency of Egypt, organizer of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer explained that 30 members of the special units, from the board of two helicopters, had launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
`On both sides fallen shots and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fled,' said this responsible, who wanted to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special units were sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he was just present, on the role played by the secret agents and elements of the Italian special units.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionality and performance of our men by secret service and by the special units," he explained without any further details.
He also argues that a ransom has been paid.
At night, the Sudanese army claimed to have stopped at a patrol vehicle where the kidnappers were, six of them, including the leaders from the shadow, killed and two arrests.
The army stated that they were associated with a rebel group from Darfur, the Liberian-Sudan-Unité movement (SLA-U), which was immediately opposed to this movement.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is making headlines and is the central theme of the current election struggle.
That's better.
But a field of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who is going to stand up and raise the pitiful sums that are given to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that irreverently starve?
Which politicians will dare to remind the federal government that they are neglecting their monuments and their culturally important buildings?
That there are no laws in Quebec, as well as in Canada, that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government provides EUR 3.5 million alone for the restoration of the Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbours have written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of the cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all Members and all government districts, in mutual agreement.
In Quebec, in the association of the historical societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 dignitaries gathered in 211 historical societies are trying to deal intensively with the history, with a few grotesques to save the numerous private archives, and to preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, who protest with the power of despair when supporters and decision makers leave their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten free holes.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux government shares of Fortis Bank
The Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has been hit by the US financial crisis in Turbulence, wants to take part in a partial settlement: the three countries provide the Bank and Insurance Institute, which also has facilities in Hungary, with a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have consulted at the highest level at the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s competition authority.
In the euro area, the Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has continued for a year, so decisions that are now taken in connection with the Bank could have a presidential character.
In the sense of the decision taken on Sunday night, all three countries purchase the respective shares of the bank at about 49 percent.
The Bank will probably sell part of its holdings, all of the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
Last week, the Fortis stock began a steep drive, and in the second half of the week, serious crisis scenarios had already begun.
However, analysts agree that the bank is too large for a plea with its 85,000 employees.
The Institute's securities fell by 12% at a 14-year-old depth on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
In view of the current stock exchange rate, the market value of the group amounts to EUR 14 billion, which, according to management, is unrealistic.
According to management, the USD 700 billion expensive American rescue package and the resulting uncertainty on the markets is due to the talway of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the rates have increased slightly.
On Friday, Philip Dierckx was appointed the new Director General of the Bank.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but no interest was found in a business offer.
The Belgian government was trying to calm down - no investor should spend his money, it said.
There has been no panic among the customers so far, the bank's branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, the Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls its own leasing companies.
Fuchs in the honeycomb
Because of human drug consumption, in America, life and health insurance often refuse to conclude a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market may become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of drug data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in an independent hand, otherwise we trust the Fuchs the Hühner" - says Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance shall determine the fees and payments in the event of damage depending on the health condition of the customer, and should the risk be underestimated, the insurance shall not be closed at all.
Previously, the customer was sent to a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only in the light of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago Dick found a much cheaper method: according to the customer's identification number, he refers to the data of the last half-years of the pharmacies, the languages which were bought, and the program calculates the patient's illness and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol lower drugs, it was followed that his blood fat level was untreated, which would automatically select him as a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that the insurance has to do more than just the paper scrap, however there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medicines can be taken for various purposes, such as migraines and heat fluctuations, but also depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the view of the insurers, while the above mentioned ones are not.
For the purpose of data collection and processing, companies have formed their own that, before they relate to the data, ask patients for their consent.
In the meantime, they must do so by law, even though neglect has not yet been dealt with.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory investigations and link them with the data on drug consumption. In order to provide an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and control of their use becomes more difficult at the same time.
While there is a personal data protection law for health data, its effect extends only to healthcare providers and insurance.
The draft law has already been submitted to the Congress, which allows the authorities to control data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is too little, so he wants to develop his program so that the data can only be transmitted with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned may hardly be able to prevent access to his data, since the insurance does not yet conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are left in some way to the grace of the fox.
Global food plan from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are both the leading trading partners of each other, this was the main issue in addition to other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, the French-Industrial Summit is also taking place, where it is mainly discussed about cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
Although the European Union recognises that India is an ambitious, democratic power which should be given more votes and co-operation in international affairs, Member States have not yet been able to agree on whether or not to support the permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at the 9th summit in Marseille yesterday.
The French President and current EU President-in-Office of the Council, Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade over the next five years, i.e. to increase to EUR 100 billion.
In view of the fact that trade between 2000 and 2007 rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this objective is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally incorporated into an agreement, so that air traffic will be avowed in the future.
By 2009 India wanted to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to create a balance in the current unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: While the Union of the partners is one India, New Delhi is only in rank nine among the EU partners.
The summit was devoted to global concerns.
Among these were the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, namely terrorism, which condemned both sides to the strongest, and the convening of a UN conference was also urged.
The Doha Round should also be completed, with both sides liable for the failure.
The EU stressed that it adheres to its energy and climate programme, which means that the emissions of pollutants should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
In this way India agreed, as with the proposal, to conclude a kind of global compromise at the future climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 per cent by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be combated, and both support the convening of an international conference on the subject of the financial crisis.
The head of government of India is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris we are looking forward to orders from French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to the Agency's reports, the agreement is to be concluded at 15 years' time.
Over 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publisher at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th fair, the most important international event for legal procurement.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair is expected for the current event of more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries. They will distribute over 171,790 square meters of the fair and present more than 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the most honored of the event.
The Undersecretary for the Ministry of Cultural Property and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented in the 264 sqm exhibition room "Punto Italia".
This will be followed by a press conference near the room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion numbers, trends and perspectives will be discussed about publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books of foreign writers in the whole, but especially in the adult and youth sectors, decreases.
Found the billionaire Steve Fossett's tiny aircraft that disappeared a year ago.
The small plane of Steve Fossett, which was discovered on 3 September 2007 on a flight over the desert of Nevada, was discovered.
The details were found on a 3,000 m high plateau, in the area of Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the aircraft.
The Sheriff of Madeira County, John Anderson, fully revealed the latest doubts during a press conference: "The aircraft has been located, on which a body has been sent. Now we have the certainty that it is the aircraft with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on or near the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Department of Transport Safety (Ntsb) informed that a team had been deployed a few hours after sighting of the aircraft, which identified the machine: it was the Bellanca 8kcab that was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fosset in Yerington in Nevada was launched for a 3-hour flight.
Finally, yesterday, too, in California, near the border to Nevada, some of the personal objects of Fossette were found by a couple near her house at the Mammoth Lakes.
This is two demonstrations with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossette was given a month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history by a long sequence of records.
In 2002, he was able to cross the World Ball in a lift balloon: a two-week, single flight.
Three years later he circled the world in a single flight without landing with a plane.
Among its several records is an altitude flight of 15445 m above the Andes, however, this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising that you don't expect
A suv, which comes from its original design and the special line management, the smooth surface and its clear angle from the traditional schematics.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to boost the sector's new breath with this offroader.
Just because of its extraordinary features, the idea of the Suv Glk will also become unconventional, which will be seen in the showroom of Mercedes-Benz from October 17th.
Thus the advertising drum, which will accompany the appearance of the new model, will also take place in new clothing, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the car sector in the backward Italy.
A project with a peak effort to be carried out by Corso Como until 15 November in different phases, which will take place in Milan's central shopping miles.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, with 3D glasses distributed near Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new suv will appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car is so apparent from the poster on which it is drawn.
This is highlighted by the Eluminium8 technology of the new gecko at different times in all its details to re-establish itself as a whole.
Without a doubt, the concern of Mercedes with this advertising is to introduce a new type of authoric clame into this rather stereotype field.
But will it make it possible to travel the interest of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it's clear who the Italian Hooligans are.
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are these 150-200 boys and girls for whom all of Italy is ashamed now? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group, which has been travelling behind the Italian national team for years and who, frankly, have not caused any serious problems until recently.
It's never happened before to clash with rival fans.
The origin of the group is in the right environment.
The sponsors came from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia were included in Sofia.
They wear the tricolori on which the cities of the militants appear: however, they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Your models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there was now a conflict with a truly radical dream, that of Levski.
From the Figc, the Italian fans were given 144 cards for the game: all were displayed on names and therefore easy to check.
In fact, they were also all controlled by the Viminal: among those traveling to Sofia, no one was in a running stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who had already been loaded in this regard, were also refused the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the Bulgarian police reports to launch further steps: in this case, the Tifosi who are arrested or identified in the outbreaks can count with a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban preventing access to stadiums throughout Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now there is of course fear of copyists, who could follow this little more than 150.
"This fire must be issued immediately, and that does not give such behaviour the opportunity to justify" is from the Viminal.
Therefore, "eyes above all also with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, in Apulia there is a small core of the Italian Ultras.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (Sportal Surveillance) gathers on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on a part of the Aise, that is, the secret services that deal with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce Calle and the right arm raised during Mameli's Hymne? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (clearly expressed without joy), who has been the director of the Observatory on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the posts of Francensco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where a core of Ultras Italia's supporters, founded in 2002.
While it is true, Mazzilli says that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duke, but the conduct of these 150-200 people was undoubtedly a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist – adds the No. 1 of the Observatory – crimes are committed in the country of their action.
So far, this group has remained in the hall, but now it has to be considered what has happened and will happen.
But we also talk about the pipes during the Hymne Mamelis: this is also not a punishment, but they allow me to miss the education ...".
