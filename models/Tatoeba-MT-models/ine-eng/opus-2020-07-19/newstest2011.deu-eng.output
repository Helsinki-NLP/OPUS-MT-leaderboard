The Czech Social Democrats in Prague don't know the Voldemort, nor the "Conditories".
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The Aktuálně.cz newspaper has "cut off" members of the new Council from the ČSSD, as they rule the notoric slang that has become a citizen in recent years, where the present coalition partners in Prague were at the Ruder.
The coded vocabulary introduced in the troubled era by Mayor Pavel Bem of Prague's political elite is one of the most famous actors, situations and cause.
Surprisingly, the new councils in relation to which these new terms are falling somewhat in the dark proved to be.
At least they said that.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I am rather a new in Prague politics," said Lukas Kaucký, the new Council of Culture, to the test of the "Patinian vocabulary".
But also Councilman Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted similarly.
For example, the term "Golfloch" means "Golfloch".
"This is the only expression of those you present to me here, which I use to go back and forth."
" Otherwise I don't feel much of a snake."
From the vocabulary published by Aktuálně.cz in June this year before the ODS election congress, the editorial took out six concepts, especially those that are notorically connected with the Prague Magistrate.
Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "largest Prague Golfloch", "go to the confectionery", "stewards", "treasures of the capital" and "lost".
Three Prague Councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future leader of Prague's school life - promised his participation in the conversation first, but then did not even take the audience away.
The fifth Councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things, and I don't judge how the citizens' democrats interact."
"For me, it is important how we understand ourselves in our programmes," he said.
As already indicated, Lukas Kaucký in the above-mentioned strike lines would not have reportedly recognized that the speech was made by the influential entrepreneur and friend of former mayor Bem, Roman Janousek.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing at all and the only term he got right in the test was "the biggest Prague Golf Loch".
"That's the Blanka Tunnel," says Kaucký, but added to the security: "But I know that from the newspaper."
And jokingly, "I'm probably going to have to take a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then not only removed from Matador Karel Březina, but also from the Council for Environmental Affairs Lukaš Plachý correctly as a Blanka tunnel.
But both Social Democrats also know for whom the term Voldemort stands and Lukas Plachý even knows where to find this figure and what it means to "go to the confectionery".
"I think that means going to some Prague gastronomy operation," Plachý is pretty close to the puzzle solution when you know that this is the seat of Janousek companies.
In agreement with Brézina, however, he appreciates having created these knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary would be his own.
According to the test participants, it does not appear that there is a similar nest among the Social Democrats.
"I have also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing with us."
"We call ourselves by name, and again we also use shorts or peaks," says the president of Prague ČSSD Petr Hulinský - named by his partner's salop "Hulda".
"In the school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina told us.
The newspaper Dník Aktuální.cz has tried the name and see there - it works.
Counsellor Weinert is friendly to the "Opa" or less friendly to the "Old", the representative of Miroslav Poche, who took note before the elections by the teams at the party sponsoring, is referred to by some colleagues as "Igráček" (known Czech lego figure).
Top marks are the only thing that allows the Social Democrats to use in the internal language.
Hulinský may not do it if it is called "Hulda", but Diník Aktuálně.cz registered another landmark of the President of Prague.
His top name "Doctor of Gummiknüppel-Recht" is apparently to do with the fact that Petr Hulinský has acquired his title Doctor juris at the Bratislaver Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "Hexen" and issued a brochure
Women who are stamped in Burkina Faso as witches usually display some common social characteristics.
They belong to the older generation, they find no work - for example for health reasons, they are free and have no children.
If one of these women goes to the witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot be dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are very rarely affected by this fate."
"Even young and healthy women are spared this because they help with work and bring children," a sister described the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home for more than a hundred women who were expelled from their communities.
The local government has now decided to oppose this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, a brochure was issued to stop "Hexen's persecution".
But the thing has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso can't read," the newspaper "the standard" pointed to the dilemma of written clarification.
The witchry is seen, however, in other African countries as well.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured by three women and two men to death - they overrun them with petroleum and just burned them.
The BBC server also reported on this incident.
The perpetrators claimed, however, that the matter would only have been a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to your version, oil that will be used for ritual salvations is extracted.
And even after the group tried to "exploit a wicked spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "Hexen" supports people here regardless of their education.
"The Standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying, "The hairdressers of human souls are a danger earlier than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to get out of the Hexenjagd, the Gambian President himself has been involved in an orderly process last year.
"President Yahya Jammeh invented a monster witch's magic after the death of his aunt, as they allegedly had a share of their death and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"He called for the help of shamane from the nearby Guinea, who, along with policemen, soldiers and the president's bodyguard, violently expelled women and men from the Gambian villages and brought the president's farm to Kanilai," said the Amnesty International in her report.
On the farm, the incested people were forced to drink an extract from plants with hallucinogenic effects, but also caused stomach and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
It was only because of international pressure that almost a thousand prisoners were released again.
A tenant of Bacala: He heats in the oven - yet he pays higher rent
An older man is leaving the client centre of the company RPG Byty of Zdeněk Bacala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a folder with three new rental contracts to three apartments: for the own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is just punishing a prisoner.
All three were just increased in terms of the so-called deregulation.
Instead of 3500 kroner monthly rentals, the son will pick up 4100 kroner next year for a 2-room apartment with kitchen in the second category.
"And there's not even running hot water in the apartment, and you have to heat it in a simple coal oven," he says angryly with his finger on the new rental contract of the son to whom he has a full power.
"But what - I have signed," he explains half agreed and half resignated.
The BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "incorrect and immoral", advises the tenants not simply to sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December, when they think of publishing a guide as they are against such contracts.
But the man only weighs off.
"One says this, the other says that," he makes a window face.
The Ostrava region becomes the largest deregulation laboratory.
After a new year, this deregulation is before most of the rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not yet paid marketable rent.
Currently, cz decided to visit this "labor" personally.
The RPG Warterarum in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine in the morning on this Tuesday.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a calling device with her.
"Lite 2011", a special key field lights on the touchscreen.
Briefly typed and the device is already ticking out a number list.
We have barely deciphered the number "157" and already taps it on the large display on the roof of the waiting room.
A half a second later, you're on the line.
A little later, an older couple enter the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the storm in the waiting room obviously does not apply to the new rental.
Most people are here to solve the common problems - repairs, insurance matters and so on.
From mid-November in the region of Ostrava, the envelopes with the new rental contracts are the most tenants of the total 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio into the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty suggests in the letters a rental increase of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special switch for new rentals in the customer centre has been open since 18 November.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is, it's only the beginning," the ladies behind the switch answer after a moment when the "client" emerges as a journalist.
The deregulation and Bacala's former mining apartments are a brilliant topic.
Before the elections, the President-in-Office of Parliament from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, of the ČSSD, had raised this issue quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor of them."
"Don't worry. WC-Brille could change them," says the man mentioned in the introduction air.
To date, according to employees, above all the tenants on the switch, in order to be sure that they will really receive the promised rent reduction that the RPG promises them when they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants who sign the new rental contract until 15 December are also expected to benefit from a half-reduced February rental.
So far, "deregulation switch" in Havířov is all but overloaded by demands.
"Only 40 to 50 of the rents of 360 customers were paid in 2011 because of this," the Schalterbeitins estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on both its websites and wall tables where it appears necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree to the new rental, they will be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but it is as information about the only legitimate legal procedure to be understood," RPG explains on its website.
"No one goes to court here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client centre at least partially right.
"I have 13,000 (Crons) rents, of which 5,000 are left for food, where I should take the money for a trial," he says.
Then the employees will be insecure.
"Look at me."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media that they are not going to sign and so the people are still waiting," she says.
The regulated rental ends in most of the Czech Republic to New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the rental increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing height of the rent is not enough to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimès, director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty, and - precisely the neglect of the housing fund criticised by the tenants is in the opinion of the owners of the main reason for the rent increase.
While RPG was able to invest in the apartments from the rentals received between 2005 and 2010, it is expected to be 5.2 billion in the four years 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the deck compared to the poles in the Havířov waiting room, a few red-lighting information is emerging again and again.
"The rental increases in 2011 amounted to 15% and less to 31,200 apartments, which means more than 90% of RPG's apartments."
"Always this means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter and month", is to be read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio increase the rental by 38 percent.
"In these cases, there is an extremely low rental price increase of 19.66 CZK per square meter," RPG argues.
In 2600 apartments the rent remains the same height next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not allow the rentals to go up and down, but gradually takes place within four and eight years.
What is more - the company has another obligation: all income from the rental increase (see diagram) wants to put the company back in the apartments, especially in thermal savings - in new windows and in the heating barrier.
But, above all, these people will benefit from signing the agreements on the rise.
Architects see - the office also includes a children's garden
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini children's garden here, including all of it: colourful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-playing space on the outside terrace.
This children's garden has been available to Arch.design staff since last year.
The design and architecture office Arch.Design, from which the studios come from a number of well-known brunner buildings, calculated from the first designs for the new building of Avriopoint with the space for its company mini-garden gardens.
In a wise expectation, because most of his 90 employees (inside) are in the babyboom age and the company is located to return the project antennas and architects to their workplace as quickly as possible.
Together with the possibility of short-term work, the kindergarten is another bonus, the Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of its social program.
The engineers and architects are so easy to bring their demanding profession and childcare under a hat.
The mini children's garden is an original idea of the employees (inside) of Arch.design and with the support of the management, they managed to earn funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operating mini-child garden is funded by the Operational Programme of Human Resources and Employment Policy through the European Social Fund and the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (CZK 2.8 million grants), the necessary facilities and facilities could be obtained and for the duration of 2 years it is provided for qualified staff and for the operation.
The company Arch.Design is obliged to continue operating the mini children's garden for another 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took place for a whole year, with effective assistance from the company Economy Rating in the processing of applications.
A well-qualified staff - a nurse and a teacher of a kindergarten - care for the children, children can visit the children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years of age.
And since this is about a mini children's garden, only 5 children may be present, however, the day varies over several children.
The child garden operation is flexible to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights regarding the use of the child garden - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the content of the programme in the mini children's garden is still comparable to the framework programme for pre-school education.
The children are not only playing here, but above all they will be given excellent education - from basic knowledge to pre-school education, as well as learning English.
The classroom is not only with toys and creative games, but also equipped with a computer that is available to children.
What is more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time, and so the stress disappears when the children are picked up from a far away garden.
Parents therefore use their working time more productively.
No wonder there are natural and loyal employers' relationships.
Arch.Design thus chose among the Czech companies that offer significant benefits in the recruitment of new employees, which are family-friendly and through such programs strengthen their staff marketing.
A bone house also fascinates after 100 years. Check out the interiors of Gaudi
The roof encourages like the back of a prehistoric axis, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn-up fish mills.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the inhabitants of the house, the house, with its organic forms, received the top names "Knochenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile fragments and mosaics, the façade and modern soft lines, all these are typical features for Antonio Gaudi's youth style.
The facade of the house plays with dreamy lines, warm colors and textures that remind nature and life.
Only in a more precise sense is it observed that everything is governed by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
In the night, the whole facade still works more plastic, dramatic and special lighting enhances the brightness of the colors.
The same swirling lines and curved shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Well-formed wood copies the window frames, tiles, tile elements of doors, even gecko holes and performances.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district on the inhabited shopping street Passeig de Gràcia No. 43 was created by the construction of a house from 1877, the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, originally stood on the brink of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but finally he agreed to the idea of Gaudís for an unusual and even cheaper conversion.
The rental house Casa Batlló, however, did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative home of the real estate owner and also the use of mosaics on the facade were his idea.
However, many other artists and artists also worked with the design of the facade.
The joint work on the drafts for Casa Batlló was the beginning of fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also took part in the construction of Gaudís Haus Casa Milá in Park Güell, where there are also other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was acquired by the residents of its organic forms due to the "Knochenhaus".
Others referred to it as the special window opening mechanism because of the "like house".
It is also said that the sword of the holy Georg, the patron of Catalonia, is on top of the building.
But also other imagery elements symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house a unique central heating system with vents and typical fireplaces for the time being.
It's a bit weird, but it's a 45-degree trend.
In his creation, Gaudí ignored all the building regulations and was not allowed to depart from them.
Before the construction began, he obtained the relevant construction permit from the city, but the information he had made about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city fathers were so disappointed at the completion two years later that they asked for help.
Among other things, the Councillors also insisted that the construction with its arrows even interfere with the public ladder.
However, there was no change, on the other hand - only fifteen days after the city district's call for this, Josep Batlló applied for the rental of the two top-level works of the house - and it was quickly granted to him.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a living room, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was confiscated to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building passes a staircase up to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reconstruction have removed all right angles and straight lines and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí, however, also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of spaces.
The social part can be fully connected through the opening of the salon doors, and thus could easily appeal to a larger society without having to give up certain intimacy in more confidential conversations.
With the exception of a new facade, Gaudís Rebau also received a fairly unusual roof and two other floors.
Gaudís game with the light as well as the blue and white glass tiles with which the inner courtyard is decorated and the lighthouses are impressive.
The game of these two colors gives a maximum light to all the floors of the house.
He simply made use of the principle that White better reflects the light than dark colors that absorb the sunlight on the contrary.
The Casa Batlló House, which was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can visit today anyone.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment of the public is made available.
The houseowners decided to take this step only in the year and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was found that this was a rather effective business, the visits were held, as it was also extended to other joints and the roofing spaces, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the building site is not a paper style, it is 16,50 euros, students, tenants, groups and holders of tourist exhibits get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entry prices to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Anyone who wants to know the true atmosphere of the house with his dragon towers should try to close friendship with one of the house dwellers and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bedrock? Women have different desires than men
Not the finest beds, but the quality of the surface - so mattresses and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must be complemented harmoniously in order to satisfy the user's wishes.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, the size, the state of health and not least the sex of the sleeper.
Also important is the interior in which mattresses and rust are subordinated.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where not regularly heated, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they need much longer to be "hot".
In addition, they are significantly more difficult than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And they should be returned regularly.
If they do not have enough vents in the core and are still on a fixed plate, moisture is due: it is not excluded that they form under their mold.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses are common with soft layer, will find it difficult to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
"Even though all the ice hockey players who have come back from the NHL have complained to me that they can no longer sleep properly here."
"For their hidden shoulders, cuts and hips, they simply need a visco foam soft layer (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer)."
"I recommend these, among other things, also people with diabetes who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and the skin badly," explains Sylva Hadamczyková, who specializes in powder furniture.
That's why I've taken care of many ice hockey players years ago, but also other customers with Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the advantages of the visco show.
This "wonder" is actually very simple.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it regularly melts on the warm body.
Nowhere does it push, in the night you don't wander around like after a hard fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
In addition, the viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (Wundbrand).
When selecting the mattress size, you should still calculate the length of the soles, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Men like women who are 180 cm in size need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the beds should be at least 90 cm wide, i.e. 180 cm.
For single beds, for example, for singles, 120 to 140 cm are provided.
The comfort is half and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule applies to the ideal bed width: "If you are on the back, there should still be enough room for the slightly angled arms," says Helena Prokopová, the master of the gymnasts and space designers, who has been devoted for years to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture, and this subject is also presented in schools.
On a double bed, each needs his own cheese and his own mattresses, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are the same height.
Otherwise, nothing else remains than mounting the rust at different heights and this is not possible at all at bedtimes.
Shadow mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters on the shape layer and the fine polish.
"With the hand or with the insert, you must not feel the feathers at all," Helena Prokopová warns.
Each mattress requires a special type of cheese.
Fully ground beds with mattresses and floor like grown Siamswills have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses can't breathe and the relationship can't wash what's already going on and giving.
And since one night between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat is lost, it is clear that the mattress becomes slowly a giant (and hidden seven) after five to seven years.
This is why professionals reject advertising, which promise a lifetime of up to 25 years in Matratzen, even lifelong guarantees.
She's got everything, but she's got it.
And so a practical advice from the dealers: In mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, you should not look at the hygiene of washable, removable relationships, but it is recommended to use a mattress cleaner that can be easily removed and washed.
Even though mattresses are usually produced today with roundabout locks, so that after opening you get two halfs (almost important for the washing process and washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially performed alone, often like the unequal fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a fixed plate in the bed instead of a rock?
Get out of here!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for one night only.
Also, they should prefer to use the plate with air holes (if they are no longer inside) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring cores and fine polishers.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong to such a substrate.
For non-adjustable latex or sandwich mattresses with 14 to 18 spring leaves (lamella) are suitable for latex or sandwich mattresses (e.g. combinations of latex and coconuts), the cheese is always paid with a larger number of latex leaves, i.e. 28 and more spring leaves, with lord dosense support in the field of lumbar spines and the possibility of regulating latency.
There are no mattresses with spring skeletal, as they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to setting the brakes of spring bars, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is a special fixation of the spring wires, which enables the spring wires to be printed or even angled so that they allow the point-insect of the shoulder of the sleeper.
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have begun to use soft areas for the shoulder area at "Lord mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - they like these soft zones in the main area.
For most demanding customers, point-elastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or rust with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multitorsion suspension are determined.
The pressure is distributed to several points, reducing tension.
But - if you use a bad (too big and full) head cushions for the right mattress and right rust, most of the benefits are lost again.
Here too is a rule: the head cushion should support the head, its tips should reach only to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a 50 x 60 cm large pillow appears, such as the Scandinavia.
In the side area, the head cushion (with the shoulder load zone in the rust or soft zone in the mattress) should equal the shoulder height.
However, something has our modern mattresses have common with the single (filled with heu) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers use more and more natural materials or at least their mixings.
The new magic word "Bio" is also used in mattresses.
Instead of petroleum, we use more and more natural oils to produce polyurethane foams - such as rice and soya oil.
Soya is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is called in the case of mattresses whose core is of pure natural origin," explains Petr Vashíček of the company Tropico Plus.
But natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattresses - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
However, you can also enjoy microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender scent while sleeping.
Here too you make a difference between a man and a woman.
While men use a "cooler" plant extract from birch leaves to absorb the heat and cool the body, the relationships for women have a "cooling" effect.
Extracts from red paprikas shoes are the blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes warm when sleeping.
What about today's favorites?
Matrasten from cold foam (he has larger pores with damaged cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffs (hards) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses, which know exactly where heads, hips and ferns are.
For a high quality mattress, however, you have 7,000 crowns and more.
However, health mattresses are usually charged with lower VAT, as they are considered medical aids.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was granted this advantage.
It's not that easy to save on the mattress and the rust.
Again and again, there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers that offer two mattresses at the price of one.
This is how the Magniflex brand offers the mattress duofreeze with respect to hidden visco foam memory for 11.990 CZK.
The second one gets free of charge.
It was the material tempur that introduced the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density into almost cosmic tempo.
No wonder they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the start.
Tempur is soft at heat, in cool environment it is fortified again.
This fits perfectly with the human body and optimally distributes the body pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal to prevent pressure burns, but it generally increases the comfort of sleeping.
Viscolastic foams, however, are used not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special foot powders, which are intended to facilitate the legs and tissues.
Domestic manufacturers use, for example, the foam substances Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to control the child
The fear of their own children grows and thus more and more parents consider monitoring them through GPS.
The system that was originally invented for driving to cars can also be good people, which in such cases would be helpful, as in the case of the untraceable disappearance of the nine-year-old Anicka Janatková.
The device is now about as big as a cigarette box, but soon it should not be larger than an armband watch.
Many people have put the case of the missing Anicka in fear and fear and thus keep them in line with the means and ways of looking to protect their children better.
Also for the price of damage to their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that it is not about spying around, but about an effective means to reduce the likelihood of tragedy," Petr Pilin from the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS equipment on the Czech market.
"I admit that it can happen on a case-by-case basis to abuse such devices, for example, if you put it in someone's pocket without knowing it, but we haven't had a case to report so far."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know the purpose of the "schachtel" and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočkova points out that a child, if not allowed to wear such a thing, is simply getting rid of it.
"Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things intentionally if they don't want to be controlled."
"At first, the phones raised great expectations with the parents, but they can easily turn off as these new surveillance devices," says Ms. Bočkova.
In your opinion, it is also disputed whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"With planned kidnappings, the child is practically always checking whether the child has any electronics with which it could be sorted."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such surveillance equipment were to be used more widely, they would also be looking for them, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, police criminals are always a step forward," says psychologists.
However, it argues that similar devices can be of great help in a sudden attack by a paedophile.
Roberta Čech from the company RC Monitoring, which offers location services for both cars and persons, can also help with the existence of such a device if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted so that it can report the position at certain intervals."
"Even if it would be destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"With expensive devices, even a tender meter is integrated, which means that if you fall down and lie without movement, the device sends a warning immediately under the position's indication," says Mr. Czech.
In his opinion, similar services could also make intelligent mobile phones with navigation, you just need to play a special software.
The problem with the current location equipment is that it is either a device in string wooden box size, the trailers are similar or smaller phones.
There's always the danger of losing it.
According to Mr Pilin of the Macro Weil, it is therefore in the present device that looks like normal digital clocks.
"This has the advantage that any attacker must not at all recognize that it is a surveillance or location device.
"Or he notices it only after a certain time, what the police give a time-incentive," he adds.
No matter what direction the development takes - to arms or trailers, the same technology is always used, as in the vehicle location.
So for the combination of location function using the GPS system (as well as the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many dentures that you can transform the whole Czech Republic but you can only hold for two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometres of fire extinguishers, which are sealed with explosives.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometres of tin to the army camp.
It is comforting to know that the forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition line - two, but at most four years.
The army bought the seal from the stock company STV Group, i.e. for 40 million crowns.
In his explanation for the purchase of this huge amount of Zündschnur, the MF DNES General Staff replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 kilometres of Zündschnur annually.
According to the research of army pyrotechnicians, the MF DNAS suggests that the entire army had to complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army commanders, to the secretaries and women of the military.
Minister of Defence Alexander Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek are not exempt.
This was the only way to justify the remarkable annual consumption of 60 kilometres of furnaces.
This length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But this too would be sufficient for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts still applies that for the training of each new professional soldier, two meters of seal, the army has created a calming warehouse for these new purchases - even in view of the increased need of pioneer and special units - for the 225 years already mentioned.
Soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade complained to Minister of Defence Vondra soon, they had almost no patterns for handguns anymore, so that the lack of resources was severely restricted.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
"I don't know why they buy from us such a lot of dentures."
But that is finally their decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we want to come up with as a dealer most widely," says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence, founded the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of zündschnur so that the army would have covered itself with this "munition" for at least ten years.
Jan Děcký from the STV Group, however, speaks only of a four-year term of use of firearms and police and army pyrotechnics for only two years.
"With perfect storage, the four mentioned years are possible," says one of them, but who wants to remain anonymous, so as a soldier not to be exposed to the criticism of the army.
After the length of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested, whether it is still reliable and not endangering the lives of the soldiers.
But these tests are not harmless, but they cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometres of ignition.
"They cost us 60 percent less than the last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," the spokesperson Pejšek tells us the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only for comparison: The annual consumption of fireworks of police pyrotechnicians, the ammo of the Second World War or the Soviet Brotherhood, has been almost 1,500 metres in length for some years.
And the police always order only such quantities of this ammunition that they can consume before the end of the period of use.
Because of the safety of pyrotechnics, it is also possible to buy more modern and therefore reliable sealtures.
Nevertheless, the Ministry of Defence has enormous problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand head Czechoslovak people's army prepared for the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics who claimed the MF DNAs, the Czech forces expect the same problem in a few years when liquidating hundreds of kilometres of old furnaces, which they have purchased today as "price".
To this day, the contacts that I have gained through competition will come to my attention.
The winning position in the competition "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" has helped Lukas Pytloun in the sale of the Franchise of his hotel.
The winner of last year's competition "Little Entrepreneur of the Year" was Lukas Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success encourages like a movie screenplay.
Lucas Pytlon is happy to live.
Only abroad did he realize that there was a lack of reasonable prices in Liberec.
From the savings of his work abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he created a house with five apartments.
Considering that he was then a high school student in the sixth semester, this must have been a brave subjugation.
"The price-quality ratio at the time made me angry, and so I tried to do something against it," says Lukas Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented to foreign workers.
He immediately reinvested in the house, which he then converted step by step into retirement with 54 beds.
Since then, he has been able to open four pensions in Liberec, two quiet restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation in Liberec.
The most comfortable of them was the fourth hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tísé, which we sold our Franchise concept and other stakeholders at the Franchise of Pytloun hotels have already reported," says the Entrepreneur Number One of the last year.
"A large share of this license sale for the operation of hotels had just won in the competition "undertaking of the year", Mr. Pytloun added with appreciation.
The victory has brought him greater popularity, yes popularity in Liberec and the environment.
"The people recognized me on the street, often they congratulated me after all, and I have to say that did really well," he recalls.
I really recommend that everyone who wants to create something participate in this competition.
You don't have to win the same, every visualisation is good.
He says that he still benefits from contacts and acquaintances, to which it would not have come at all.
"With some people I have met thanks to competition, I maintain regular business relations to this day."
The fame associated with success, according to his opinion, is a little lower on each of his employees.
And there he is at the seventy.
"I note with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that is given to general recognition."
I also see this not only as personal success, no, that is the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just a little in the foreground," says Lukas Pytloun modest.
I wish my followers a quieter year when we had it in the farm
The victory ceremony was quickly resolved by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his target effort, Farm has the worst behind him.
The price for the first rank of the competition Vodafone Company of the year in the past year was taken by Karel Žjárský, the owner of the farm.
At the time, the jury appreciated the efforts he made to get a company out of the ground from the small tool building in Česká Skalice, making hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this appreciation not only encourages me, but also encourages all my employees and has strengthened our self-consciousness in the fight against competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of the farm's company history, the effort was made to do something useful.
And then when the state offered his father Karel Ždźárský as a compensation for the property seized by the communists a small workshop for the plot, he hesitated not long, left his career in the company where he had been busy until then, and with a few comrades of his father's own company for the production of plastic horses.
A short time later, they began to focus on plant oil.
Within 18 years, they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic press throughout Central Europe.
But only through the success of the competition mentioned and its mediaization has it entered into the consciousness of the non-disclosure.
"Not only that our customers now perceive the Farm brand significantly more intense, our foreign partners also began to be able to work with a company that has achieved the greatest success in their country, to measure greater value," says Karel Ždźárský.
Last year, however, farm was not only in the sign of victory victory.
The assessment was based on the company’s economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And in 2009, it was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, which at the time was even smaller than the citizens, but above all the companies, reached its peak - many companies were forced to set up their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course, we couldn't escape this situation."
"The sales went back by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even take up discounts," explains Karel Ždźárský.
A viable enterprise must also take such unpopular measures.
However, it was possible to get the situation in the grip and keep the company in the black numbers, even if with less profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was unwilling to withdraw - in the case of investment in research and development.
"From the grant, we built a research and training centre, strengthened our presentation at international fairs and acquired major awards at domestic exhibitions," says Jjdárský.
Everything proves that we've overcome the crisis.
The sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy at victory - but in a calmer atmosphere," Karel Ždźárský points out.
A question of opinion, which is covered by unreasonable rules
The question of "absoluteness of the year" is the fourth part of the competition.
Some foolish rules have already succeeded in creating from the world.
To the doubtful winners of the next year's opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year", the obligation to create documents on authorities that are available online advanced.
Thus, more than a third of non-agricultural entrepreneurs decided.
The Social Insurance Administration thus demanded a paper extract from the trade register, even if the official could have picked it up by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is changing.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require any extracts from the trade register in the future when social insurance policy is checked," ČSSZ spokesperson Jana Buranová said.
The meaning and purpose of the opinion poll "absoluteness of the year" is to take all the rules and arrangements under the lupes, to meet the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to lift the foolish ones.
This year is already the fourth part of a competition organised by the so-called Economic Journal (HN) and enjoyed in the public accruals of growing popularity.
If three thousand people took part in the vote last year, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, for there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve only and alone to hinder business.
"For example, as regards the number of income tax forms, we take a leading rank in the world," notes Karel Havlíček from the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and traders of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurship is the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
However, compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic has improved little.
According to data from the World Bank, the Czech Republic takes the 74th rank in relation to the business conditions, compared to the previous year a worse placement of around eight places.
The competition for the absurdity of the year was first called out in the year and plays out each year after the same scenario.
From April to the closing of the competition, everyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense at the end of September.
For registration, the Web address www.firmaroku.cz. Then the competition organizer is looking for seven candidates for the "antipriise" and allows the public to vote on the Internet at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It beats the absurdity that gets most votes.
For this year's opinion poll, more than one hundred and more, 105 meaningless rules and regulations have already been notified.
The tips are not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
For example, among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are also provisions that maintenance vehicles have to pay for motorways and high-speed roads or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must present every two years.
The list of this year's "sieben" is published on the sides of the competition.
The opening of competition in Prague at the beginning of November is part of a event in which political and public life also regularly participates.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the Association of Small or Medium-sized Enterprises and the company of the Czech Republic and Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic at the height of the competition with the party.
"Where the state throws business ties between the legs, there can be no real economic upheaval, so my goal is to lift at least thirty paragraphs each year, which are still unnecessary for entrepreneurs today," said Martin Kocourek, Minister for Industry and Commerce.
Efforts to create foolish arrangements from the world show an effect.
In 2007, the majority of entrepreneurs were obliged to notify the company at its permanent place of business three days in advance of their intention to move to an exhibition or Kirmes.
This obligation was lifted by a novelty of the commercial law.
The duty, which received the second largest number of votes in 2007, - the duty to report to the Labour Office services of employees for up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so called "Green Card".
And all the good things are three:
To the absurdity of the year 2009, the regulation that put in place physiotherapists was chosen to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two passenger cars in the talking room.
This Regulation has been extended to some extent by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigeration obligation has gone away.
A new category of public awareness-raising companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, education or sport projects
A new feature in this year's fifth anniversary of the competition of the Economic Journal (HN) is the category "Comprehensive Company of the Year 2010".
In the light of this competition, it is appropriate and fair to encourage enterprises.
"We would like to support such companies that are aware of the consequences of your entrepreneurship and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrick Bartholdy, regional manager of the Vodafon mobile phone company, the caller and guarantor of this competition, as well as the "Rebell of the Year" competition.
For this year's first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company of the year notified companies for which success is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and fine enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ in the subject matter of their diametrical activity, their efforts nevertheless have a common denominator - support and consideration.
For example, this is about disabled people, as it is about personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a fund for children with disabilities for seventeen years.
Also, a paper factory from Poděbrady takes care of its health disabled employees, who make up 70 per cent of their staff, for which it was rated with the title "Comprehensive Company of the Region of Central Böhmen"; in the competition Vodafone Company of the year, it awarded the third rank in the context of this region.
In the Olomouc region, the bookkeeping company MiRyz Soft managed to introduce a liquid and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours per week, without a relative reduction in wages.
The jury also honored the fact that the company purchases mainly from Czech producers, supports citizens' initiatives in its environment and works in accordance with environmentally friendly principles.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible to keep the consequences of our entrepreneurship and administration as little as possible for the environment," explains Managing Director Milosze Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the region of Ústí nad Labm is located in the health of its employees and has therefore created ergonomic chairs and keyboards for all notebooks, and also promotes them in their work at home and in business operations, using mapping services offered by a home-protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the foundation "People in Not", which provides concrete help to the Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the representative of the company.
Not least is the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čisčení" from the Karlsbader region, which contributes its employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance.
"We provide our employees with contributions to the maintenance, the work path, the promotion of their skills and the holiday," says Josef Strapáč of the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Mährisch-Schlesian region.
To the category Responsible Company of the year, all district finalists of the competition Vodafon Company of the year were automatically registered, which answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer by August 15th.
Wrong or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the law firms left the questions unresponsible, they were excluded from the competition "the company responsible for the year", but in the main competition Vodafone company of the year they were not disqualified."
"A separate application only for this competition is not possible, as it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman by the eventing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Ground Fund - arrests of the police at a public tender
In the building of the fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police took over the last few days arrests.
The local media contractor and real estate dealer Luboš G. was led by the detectives in handcuffs.
It had allegedly tried to manipulate a direct public competition to deal with claims for refunds in such a way that the property offered in the competition was of particular interest.
This would have paid Luboš G. half a million for it.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person because of the crime of fraud in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner Public Prosecutor of the "Právo" newspaper, could not provide further details regarding the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released from the police.
In what way he was able to manipulate public competition, one can only speculate in view of the special official information.
The spokesman for the Lubomír Černá Foundation raised the issue of Právo, which the police had actually arrested in the Pilsner in front of the Foundation during a public competition.
"It went for a client and night for one of our employees," she said.
According to the public competition, Mrs Černá had the correct term "Deposit to tender claims for the transfer of land in accordance with the Land Law" and would take place in cases where several applicants were interested in the property offered.
"These persons, in the context of the call, offer a higher value of their claims to be settled by the transfer than the value of the acquired property."
"In accordance with the requirements offered, the order of the potential buyers is determined, then the soil fund transfers the property to the person with the highest bid", explains the speaker of the fund.
Luboš G. apparently provided information that had been submitted to the invitation and that he was a entitled person because he had purchased a number of claims for refunds, he suggested that he withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat finding.
This would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money when he was arrested.
Luboš G. already had very good contacts with Pilsner Ground Fund in the past.
In this way, he also played a role in the case of the former head of the Václav Sankota Foundation, which was prosecuted for having issued land which had already been covered by local decisions on construction.
At that time, for example, Luboš G. also acquired land which was intended to build public roads at the site where the construction of the access highway to the Borské Pole area was planned.
Later he exchanged it very positively with the magistrate against a house directly in the historic centre of the city, which exceeded the value of the land.
At the time, the town hall had to have a heavy heart attack so as not to endanger the construction project by blocking the property.
Household living costs rise by a few hundred per month
As of January, the budgets must not only be charged with higher costs for all energy types, but also with higher water and wastewater charges, and for remote heat and elsewhere, rents also grow.
As of January, several hundred crowns will have to be removed from the wallet monthly.
Power becomes up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas is 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies, and in some places the remote heating supplies also consume.
The flat budget costs a few hundred crowns a year alone.
The high current prices were reduced by all main suppliers, so the clear promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, notably from photovoltaic sources.
Gas becomes only moderately expensive, however, precisely when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
So here too is to be calculated with a few hundred crowns per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive in whole Czech Republic, the prices for district heating are different from city to city.
Especially larger places plan price increases.
For example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay more monthly for remote heating up to 50 kroner, more than 1000 kroner families pay more per year in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague, in turn, threaten 9 percent higher water and wastewater charges and this in case the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rental doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague is still among the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In the northern arc, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges are expected to rise by 7.4 per cent.
Huge rental price increases are expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rental regulation disappears from January.
For example, the apartment company CPI Byty, which has 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase the rentals by about one hundred percent from January.
Those who do not agree with this increase will be interested in the company's legal interests.
The regulated rentals, which are still paid in about 300,000 apartments today, are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children drink with remote and Rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, Rum and Wodka, except once again a good whisky that was stolen from the house bar to the father.
These are the drinks, after which under fifteen Czech teenagers are often not treated.
No exceptions are children who have to sleep in the hospital repeatedly.
This is reflected in the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the admission of child clinics.
"B beer or wine are completely out of fashion, because it simply lasts too long until you are drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the head of the Children's Department in the Middle Bohemian Clinic of Hořovice.
"Whisky, if it succeeds in getting the father a bottle out of the house bar, and if not, then at least remote or wodka.
"Wodka has the advantage that you can mix it with juice, then he doesn't smell so strongly," explains the chief.
The speaker of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová is entitled to him.
"Most often it's about remoteness or space."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially at primary schools."
"It was also about Slibowitz, which you take home from home," said Mrs. Jurinová.
According to Chefarzt Pelikán, 13 or 14-year-old drinkers are no exception in hospital admission for a long time.
In front of the hospital in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he has been working for ten years in the Paediatric Department of the Hospital Motol, where the rescue car was delivered from nearby and remote.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"Your career began with 12 years when she was first delivered to blood with 3.5 promille alcohol and still in combination with "extase", the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition site in Holešovice on some dance party."
"The interesting thing was that it didn't even happen to her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," says the chief.
The lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance in attacking their own spree is considered to be one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
To make a real dependence in the true sense of the word, there are no experts, according to children.
"Under alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena, and this is not the case with these children."
In the case of those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, it is usually a negative family-social background characteristic," explains Chefarzt Pelikán.
According to Ms. Jurinová, the spokesperson of the hospital Motol, about forty children drunk until mid-November were placed in the home department for child and youth medicine.
However, only cases of heavy alcohol poisoning that require hospital stay go into statistics.
Children who are taken home from their parents or, where appropriate, from the police after ambulance treatment are not registered.
In addition to the cases in which children can only drink a bottle of snacks in the school base, in the opinion of Mr. Pelikán, there are three year-old amplitudes on which is a hundred percent discount: Walpurgisnocht, Silvester and the end of the school year.
"The latter was called for two reasons - either because of the bad witness or because of the joy of the holidays."
"I've also experienced seven poor children in the night of Walpurgis," says Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who has only to fight with an unpleasant cat the next day.
The headaches in the morning following dehydration and glucose deficiency can be caused in the hospital by a fluid-dependent infusion with glucose and nutrients that are missing from the body.
"They're clearly better at it, because after the "wonderful" experience in the evening, they wake up with good laurel, without doing anything to hurt."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," says Dr. Pelikán, hiding the patient with at least the good pay by telling them the costs she's going to cost the treatment.
Because transport with the rescue car and the night in an acute bed is good and is happy to receive a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"I used it as a means of education once again, when I directly calculated to the children at the visit, what it cost them to drink, and that it can happen quite well that they have to work over the whole holiday to earn the money for a single such fat," added Dr. Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the hospitals do not intervene in return procedures in order to require the parents to pay the necessary costs for the care of the drunken children.
Two training planes L-159 for the first time in a foreign hand - in Spain
Two light battleplanes L-159 of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defence exchanged against the transport aircraft Casa C-295M, flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS sits.
It is the first time that machines of this type are owned by a foreign army.
They had only been seen at maneuvers or air shows abroad.
This is about the two-way two-way version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are L-159.
These are still preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the broker of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken over last week.
When they ship the aircraft physically from Vodocody, Jan Pejšek, according to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence, is not yet known.
In turn, the L-159 single-wing aircraft were isolated from long-term aircraft, without further deposits and investments from the Ministry's facility.
"The L-159T1 double seats have been replaced in the current state and appearance," said Pejšek of the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army would not have to leave without two-seat combat aircraft, as in May 2009, the Ministry of Defence signed with Aero Vodocody a 200 million contract on the conversion of four surplus L-159 to the two-seat version.
A new aircraft has taken over the army in July, the second will take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed itself to implementing the combat aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is the carrier of the L-159 aircraft and that they are intended to be used to train NATO pilots.
"It is therefore the matter of the receiver, how he realizes the matter," Pejšek said.
The Economic Journal (HN) had also reported that the Spanish government had no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was still approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not written a tender procedure for purchase, but EADS spoke directly.
The defence office then argued that this exchange will support the future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it used only 24, the rest wanted to sell them.
The purchase of the aircraft Casa may also have a judicial role to play.
The European Commission complained to the Czech Ministry of Defence, namely the European Court of Justice.
The army has already taken over three Casa planes, which is scheduled to land on Kbely Airport in the last fourteen days.
A longer sign finger than ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men whose fingers are longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of becoming ill with prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published by the British Journal of Cancer on Wednesday.
This is to relate to the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, and this is especially for men up to sixty," explained the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health burdens, Mrs Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, she followed with her colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, while at the same time 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants in the study, the sign finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men there was the same probability of prostate cancer as for 19 percent of the men whose rings and signs were the same length.
However, in men whose finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk fell by 33 percent, in men up to 60 by 87 percent.
The ratio of the two fingers mentioned, which are already in prenatal age, clearly reflects the different mirrors of sex hormones that the child was exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer finger.
Previous studies have shown that the testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancers.
Václav Pačes, the leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK, that this study was quickly known to him, yet he held the relationship between finger length and cancer risk so far.
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is under a snowboard on Thursday morning.
On the streets and dues are usually solid snow, winter servants were mostly all night on axles.
The D5 motorway between kilometres 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is blocked due to some accidents of Lkws and Pkws and also the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague "stands".
Novinky.CZ said this by the exhibitors of the Central Auto Motor Club (UAMK).
At a distance of 91 kilometres, an LKW was damaged, at a distance of 93 kilometres, two Lkws fell together, and in this accident there were injured.
A few pkws lie in the street grave.
There are also problems at 185 kilometers of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Here too, two lkws have collapsed.
The riders should leave immediately behind Brno at 190 kilometres or over Brno and head to Kývalka at 182 kilometers.
There are miles of staus.
On the D11, too, an accident happened and the same thing happened on the way to Prague.
In Prague itself is a several centimeter thick snowboard and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Autocolons are formed, for example, in Prosek, the Straße Štěrboholská is completely hidden.
The safest means of transport is in any case the metro.
The roads run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Peaceplace.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis staff will meet.
There are also problems at the railway and at the airport.
The Czech railway had to cancel seven high-speed connections due to snow travel.
There are problems, for example, on the Prague - Kralupy route or also Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should be absolutely informed of the current situation.
The airport Ruzyně has been closed from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Wednesday.
Most of the roads in the south are only manageable with increased caution.
In the area of Brno, three side roads around Vyškov are completely inaccessible, snowshoes are apparently forming and snowflakes are forced to be used on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are still three streets completely blocked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Sharatice - Mileshovice.
Here too you will have to use snowflakes to clean up snowflakes.
Once they are redriveable, they can't be estimated until now.
In the Hodonín region, care is taken in the area of white carpathies.
On the streets that can be spread only with inert beams for natural protection reasons, there is a thickness of up to five centimeters of snow cover, led by ČTK.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of neuschnee fell, most of them in the north - up to 18 centimeters.
In the Maurish-Schlesian region, up to 15 centimeters of neuschnee fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it is slow to cut.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
For the first time, the American troops have used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, which is known to date only under its code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the force relationship to its merits.
The new weapon is something like a super-precious cannon.
Its projectiles are directed to the target by laser with a hit-safeness of only a few meters.
The special bulkheads of 25 mm caliber designed for this weapon and containing high-explosive explosives work practically like small grenades.
The shots can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point on their ballistics route.
That means you can use it against an enemy hiding behind a barrier - a wall or in a protective tomb.
It is not usually protected from above, so it can be easily untied by the murder of the steel slab from above.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new warfare is the first infantry weapon to make use of "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier basically assumes this: he points to the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, then he wins a exact point of view after which he corrects the rise angle, then he just needs to push off.
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When pressed, the weapon is called up and shot at the distance of 543 meters plus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are being reduced
The Fujitsu Group leaves its settlement in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will be transferred to Astro Park from the former office building at the Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg.
The Japanese group Fujitsu leaves its settlement in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry crisis specialized in computer and maintenance was announced on Wednesday, 400 women and men will be placed in the Astro Park, a large office complex at Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad, in July next year.
A speaker from Fujitsu explained that, in the medium term, there should still be 100 more jobs in the group that have been distributed to the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive, and the large-scale offices in Astro Park are better opposed to the employee's way of working.
In Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was also just a tenant.
Managing Director Bernd Wagner said, "With Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connection to the airport is of great importance for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The recent transfer of an important company within the region called for yesterday's joy in winning and disillusionment with the losers.
Frankfurter Economics Senator Markus Frank (CDU) said that a Global Player was once again won.
That was a "great locality."
Fujitsu goes to the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The Bad Homburger Mayor Michael Korwisi (Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was informed early by the management of the intention.
"We have of course offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at the Marienbader Square.
Finally, economic reasons would have given rise to the shock.
Now it is to prevent a long gap in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and owner of the building is cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu so far at the courthouse and the neighboring "Small Verticale" belonged to the other buildings at the Marienbader Square ten years ago to the most controversial construction projects in Kurstadt.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, between the railway station and the town hall, a new city entrance was created, which provided both for the massive construction of the areas previously used as a parking lot and the height of the buildings for criticism.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel sales systems, Start Amadeus, and then the computer manufacturer Fujitsu connected with Siemens, addressed the houses.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group, together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund, and sold a year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consuls resident in Tokyo are the third largest IT providers in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The settlement in the Rhein-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but far more employees include Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions is located in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries in this place are to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, it was rented in the office building Astro Park 7000 square meters.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name plays on its star-shaped foundation - has its seat, among other things, in the Central Association of Electrical Engineering and Electronic Industry.
Amazon locks server - threats against assange
Wikileaks is becoming increasingly stressed.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
Perhaps there is political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks founder Assange appears to be standing in England.
Wikileaks' disclosure platform is increasingly under attack in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their previous American server and are now searching for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called in other countries and companies to the boycott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's catch list, is scheduled to be held after a newspaper report in Britain.
"Vikileaks forced by Amazon server."
"Free speech in the country of the free," the disclosure activists announced via short notice service Twitter on Wednesday (place time).
The Amazon Internet company had recently banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had retired from the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in the publication of the secret diplomatic posters in order to manage the high numbers of access to the documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks went on to say: "Excellent - our dollars will now be spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such problems with freedom of speech, "they stop selling books".
Amazon has stopped using its server via Wikileaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman's research, the TV channel CNN reported on Lieberman's office.
The president of the Senate Committee on Home Protection had threatened Amazon with a boycott, reports the British "Guardian".
"I wish Amazon had taken this measure earlier because of the previous publications of information classified by Wikileaks," said the senator.
Lieberman therefore called on the platform to also in other countries reject the use of servers.
"Wikileaks' illegal, unforgivable and reckless action puts our national security at risk and threats to the Globe's life," said a statement by the partial senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in his efforts to distribute stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is sought by the authorities in Sweden because of the suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's catch list.
According to a report by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian in Great Britain, the exact place is Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always referred to the investigations in Sweden as an intruder of his opponents.
Wikileaks speaker Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London there were threats.
"There were even calls after a murder of Julian Assange."
Therefore, Assange rightly feared for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to hide.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be accused and executed for treason.
In Canada, a advisor to Government Chief Stephen Harper - apparently ironic - said that assanging should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange there was a fire exchange.
The speaker of American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "laughing and absurd" that Assange had demanded the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently known espionage appointments to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The U.S. government now includes the protection of its databases in the field of testing.
As Special Representative, the Vice Director of the Anti-Terrorism Centre, Russell Travers, was appointed, the White House shared.
Travers is responsible for the development of "necessary structural reforms" that have become necessary after the release of the message reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to examine ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The US government also announced that they should be in danger by publishing Wikileaks for the safety of dissidents and activists.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said external official Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice
At the "Gelato University" at Bologna, ice dispensers are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest summit and visitors from all over the world.
Where does the whole ice actually come from?
From ice cream and from ice cream.
The icemaker, in German somewhat old-fashioned, presents the cream according to all the rules of Italian icemaking.
The gelataio takes the ice cream out of the fridge with a bowl, spreads it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know that, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who wants to know more about ice, it does not come to the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The ice university has set up the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 so that the ice cream from its machines can be repaired all over Italy's high ideals.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest summit and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also multi-day special courses around chocolate and practice in the home’s ice-cream.
Some dream in the midlife crisis of a new career, others simply wander on the smooth ice of their vague luck.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow-food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and wants to take advantage of some of her own in a nervous job after years.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an iceberg in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Galetiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Deciding is not only good taste, but also silky greed and good consistency.
Luciano, however, does not forget the healing of the national and even Southern superstructure: "Italian Gelato is just the best - and then there is still a lot of romance."
The first step to manufacture seems quite simple.
Luciano picks the basic ingredients of milk, soap, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large mixer that heats everything up to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then cools down to four degrees immediately.
Then he turns up on the machine, and comes out a pasteurised white bass cream, the basis for all dairy varieties.
Immediately, the teacher will be confused with questions: Can you only produce ice cream with natural substances without stabiliser?
How can you let your own experimental appetite run free?
Luciano warns to be led by the Time Spirit into the Irish.
Those who speak of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers, however - usually a natural product, such as guarkernmel from the guarbohne.
Of course, you can make ice without stabilizer, only then it must be sold within one day, otherwise it sucks together, and the customer bites on loud ice pellets.
Certain variations in the base mass are allowed.
It's going to be more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste of ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or in the sweetness of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to attract dozens of flavoured additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Both at fruit orbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even at the ice cream from the white base mass, which becomes with eggs to yellow cream and with cocoa powder based on all possible chocolate deposits.
Now the participants are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano allows each to produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mokka and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavourings or other natural additives.
In the same experiment, the fruit varieties are also subject to the same test.
More flavourings, more fruit purée - tasteful this is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice does not taste much more nudity if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice represents the working group that uses more fruit, less water and slightly less stabiliser.
Only a balanced mix brings the taste of a gelato right out, says Luciano.
Ice production is a calculation task: If Pfrich-Puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content must be reduced in the basic recipe.
An extra-portion sugar is necessary for lemons.
Luciano pulls out a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winzers measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Luckily, tables facilitate the computerry.
Making ice does not require as much physical use as before.
Not only does the device help the automatic production of the base mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is crushed creamy at the same time and cooled at minus temperatures.
All automations to the contrary do not remain small pans.
The Brazilian Gustavo folds himself and his students from the top to the bottom with fruit pears, when the overdimensional stabmixer beats him out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time until something like this happens."
Checks in selection
The European Food Authority is subject to the industry experimenting with replants.
This proposal is now formulated by the Expert Group Testbiotech, which is understood as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said Testbiotech Chief Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa Group of Experts for Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have been under contract for years at the Lobbyist Association Ilsi.
It is paid by groups such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has played a major role in the Efsa testing regulations for gene plants and thus stands in a clear conflict of interest, criticised Then.
The EFSA regulations are partly equivalent to Ilsi's position papers and thus bear the manuscript of the industry, which is to be controlled by the Italian Parma by the authority.
It was already the second time that Test Biotech had a conflict of interest.
Thus, a high-ranking Efsa manager is recently without a notice or transition time to the Swiss Farm Group Syngenta - and has thus changed the pages.
The medium German radio (MDR) had recently revealed personal links between the EU's controlling authority and industry lobby, as the Environment Agency has made clear, as well as EU Parliamentarians.
The EFSA cannot recognise any conflicts of interest.
All serious data, including those of industry, should be taken back, as long as they are of high professional quality, is referred to in an opinion.
The experts who work for Efsa do not require that they have no contact with industry.
But they had to reveal it.
Kuiper organizes his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This is itself a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - including risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In the case, independent experts such as Then criticise that genetically modified plants are currently allowed without any feeding attempts in animals and the response of plants to environmental influences will not be tested.
"We want to know what makes a genetically modified corn on the land," says Then.
The current practice was to test only isolated proteins, but not all of the plants, which did not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how can you find them?" says Then.
That's what Angelika Hilbeck looks like.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
Industry in this area as well as in the USA is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
There are therefore hardly any researchers who are not involved with groups.
Critical studies for companies would generally not be published.
"Industry controls security research," Hilbeck claims.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell has also taken care of about 400 kilos in total.
On the Monday evening, he stood in the shape of Stuttgart Train Station, the Tuba on the back.
It was Demo.
It's cutting.
The story is known: In September the Baggers were excited and had begun to break down a large part of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands of demonstrated against S21, the billion-thousand-thick location of the railway station.
When it came to the construction site, most of the bird was in drums.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Craigsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Eastfieldern, 43 years old.
He saved himself a few of the fractures.
"These stones are Reliquien."
"They must not disappear."
He shouts, "A cheaper and poorer stone, simple and earthy."
When he gave up, he smelled like a cigarette.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with the fractures yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of the Stuttgart stone leads to a forest near Tübingen on a former munitions depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his stone kingdom.
The 44-year-old deals with old stones.
He bought all the people who attacked him when he was abrissed in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame, they would be framed to skate or disappear in the deposit," he says in his office, a wooden bunk that once was a watchhouse.
He was ridiculed and threatened, he tells when in September he was in the newspapers that he bought the rest of the northern wing from the discounter.
But he spoke with the S-21 opponents, long ago.
And he told them he couldn't do anything for the abriss right now.
And if it happened again, it would be the wisest thing if the stones were to be used again.
Approximately 200 S-21-computers then took one of the 80-kilometer-hard frames, piece price 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a thought, some, but also in the hope of being able to restore it when it is rebuilt.
500 tonnes had bought rounds, 25 large trucks.
About half is still in the forest, the rest is sold for the longest time.
Garden owner, landscape garden, house builder.
From everywhere, they had come and had dragged away what the suitcase and trailers could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of the attack have long been transformed into "mature" or into limitations of herbs.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"It wouldn't be the political component."
He rises in his parking lot, making a tour through his 20 hectares of kingdom.
Jura has studied and broken down, later biology, then he's interested in computer and has finally become a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
40000 tons of stone stored it.
From all over Germany, he collects his treasures.
He says he's the biggest old stone dealer in the Republic.
It's braked.
In the snow there are artificially kept sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, warm.
"My favorite stone."
It's going up the road through the forest.
It shows on a hill: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe Railway Station.
And more.
"Sweet Travertin."
At one time, the quads belonged to the court of the Stuttgart Neckarstad.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Bureau, red granite from the Dom Sankt Blasien, tuff from the Heilbroner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When the rings think of how the stones were cut by hand and moved with simple bottles and oxcarnes, he will be very afraid.
"It would be a scandal if you were to make such a fuss."
He hasn't become rich, he hasn't even become a stone.
But 14 people are busy today, as well as they have fallen down in the forest stone metze, a sculptor, a smide, a glass bubble and a garden builder.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the restorative.
He'll have to go to Cologne soon.
There are also rocks to save.
Talent struggle for high potentials
It reigns in a royal andrang at the buffet.
16 Students insist on salmon, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Autobauer Volkswagen have invited the engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they will be able to facsimile with VW developers over the car of the future – and get to know people next to cars.
In the competition for the smartest heads, many companies are now in the neighbourhood and, like VW, are in cooperation with the universities.
Your mission: The most successful graduates will be recruiting in the hearing rooms as early as possible before they come to the labour market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities do not issue opinions on the performance of their students, they try to highlight the exceptions in practical projects and join in.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car company throws around the talent.
A young lady from the staff department distributes ballwriters, rubber rings and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young people about practical programs and students' jobs and shows them ways in the groups.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig manages the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students get in touch with industry and gather experiences."
"VW can get to know students at the same time, look closer to interesting candidates and think about who comes in question as an employee."
Such co-operations, such as celle, are not unusual.
Newly said that the students would be built so offensively.
"Unfortunately, the focus was rather on the professional project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably get even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large range of applicants.
They must be awarded and particularly to highly qualified workers.
In particular, graduates from engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the German Engineering Association VDI, more than 40,000 engineering facilities remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering accident is going to get even bigger, according to VDI forecasts.
For the business audit and consulting company KPMG, Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunt.
He organizes extensive recruitment events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern cutting hunt where participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the United States next year.
In addition, participants can view KPMG files and get to know the company.
Who can decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the Créme de la Créme of the many applicants fly to the United States.
At the Hauen and Stichen around the High Potentials at the Universities, the shields according to Dykta are growing.
"We want to get rid of the race."
"Just a simple sailing session was too small for us."
For talent hunters, Dykta seems to be billing.
"To this day we have contact with all participants of a similar action in the past year."
"Some of them are just ahead of their end and want to apply to us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct boom at the campus, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises also go to the Pearce in professional fairs.
"We're trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"A bit on the intersolar," Sitha Stübe, staff leader at Solar Technology manufacturer Solarworld, reports.
The Bonner Company employs around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stube knows about the growing problem.
Currently, 35 posts are published on the company website.
"It's just very difficult to occupy vagrant positions."
"It costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the uni-professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors show that we can practice or write our diploma."
Dear advertisements are not mentioned in the solar specialist.
For this, the company tries to recruit with other advantages for itself: Personal atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"It can't often offer a large group," says Staff Manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays the main role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good climbing opportunities are other crucial factors.
In a study of the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld placed 55th place among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute is creating an annual best list of German employers.
It asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and work environment and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
Staff leader Stübe is also hoping for extra points from the placement with the job seekers.
"I think that applicants are looking particularly for external evaluations about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients on more authenticity.
And that means, according to warriors, above all internal measures.
"The best way to be attractive as an employer is through its own employees," he says.
In the sector, the internal employer branding, i.e. employers' market formation within their own staff, is called the internal employer branding.
"Happy employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, they would be hired by their own friends and acquaintances for their employers.
"It's like a band game," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
Before the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drilling in the coming years.
A corresponding ban has been passed by the government in Washington - thus definitively withdrawing its earlier plans.
New drillings are also prohibited before the Atlantic coast.
This was shared by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban to be applied for at least the next five years is the explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the accident, which cost eleven workers their lives and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signaled on the pressure of the opposition and industry to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
In this way, supporters want to reduce the dependence of the US on oil supplies abroad.
Those who bear the responsibility for the devastating oil shortage in the Gulf have not been fully understood to this day.
The British energy group BP, which is confronted with billions of demands, is in the centre of the criticism.
A committee of inquiry on behalf of Obama will present its results during December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar had lifted the drilling stop hung after the explosion.
Following this, different oil groups immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter safety regulations, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a recent disaster.
At present, the competent supervisory authority, which has been set up in response to numerous corruptions, is fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama has announced that the oil and gas group will close lucrative tax closures.
The industry now publicly warns that the amount of aid in the Gulf would be significantly lower by stricter regulation than before.
"The plans of the government are the biggest brakes for the growth of the oil and gas industry," says the result of a current industry survey by the BDO consulting firm - even before the drilling ban of Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what will change with the regulation."
Investments in new funding projects would be suspended until further notice - loading of growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the tank site: billions of litres of crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil cooks.
Celestine Akpobari thinks it's good.
"Don't bother yourself," the eco-activist calms the journalists: "You'll still get enough oil sludge in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has been trying to light up a boy in the water to the breast with the veils surrounding him: in the rainbow-coloured water gloss, the scene seems almost beautiful.
That under the surface of brown crude wood forests is not visible.
Earlier she had collected yarns here, tells Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo-Jetti River.
In the meantime, the water that flows is completely dead.
Five years ago, from a drilled pipe line, a lot of crude oil went into the huge wet area.
Fisher from the nearby town of Bodo now has to mine six hours to reach fishing waters: the country of Ogoni located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the worst devastated regions in the world.
On the journey through the mangrove storms caused by rivers, the whole extent of destruction is apparent.
Instead of light water, the motorboat blows brown bridges, who dives his hand into the water, pulls out the oil fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees are like black lactating stems from the ground, causing individual palm trees to hang their tails.
Bird fever, as they are used to in wet areas, is sought for forgiveness: As soon as the outer border is bent, the former paradise, which is rich as a tank site, spreads out of its splendour.
"What happens here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari window: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is in place.
The settlement area of Ogoni has been a battle field for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe entered here, organized in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa of the first resistance, here the Shell Group had to set up its production because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Today, the company is still denied the return to Ogoniland: While the three-fold size of Switzerland with more than 5000 drilling sources and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines are pumped every day over two million blocks of black gold, the oil fields broke in Ogoniland, too unstable is the situation for the Group.
All a couple of hundreds of meters reach stealthy places like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christe trees" are called the heads of holes too affectionate.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the mark.
Always break such a drill head apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil runs into the water.
More than two billion litres have been flown into the delta's ecosystem in 50 years, according to expert estimates: year-on-year, the amount of oil, as it was brought into the sea 21 years before Alaska - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Those who are responsible for the continued eco-guay will be challenged.
While the Shell Group's sabotage and organized oil dust accounts for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see heavy drilling heads and leak pipelines as the main source of pollution.
Shell has significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than is usual in the world, US scientist Richard Steiner suggested to the group 2008: Only the rate of defects on the lines is "to be multiple times higher than elsewhere".
At a place that looks like an abandoned, oily workshop under the free sky, dives from the Mangrove shapes: they are split-up and oiled up to the neck.
Under one of the many fibers that are partly connected with tubes, partly willing to spread out on the ground, a fire flakes: an illegal small refinery.
In the façade, the oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the leader of the group.
First, petrol penetrates through the pipes into the catch floor, later drop field at the end of the drive of Kerosin and finally diesel.
Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel a 300 litres daily: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - about 22 dollars.
The Delta residents use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The slightly low diesel price of almost 40 euro cents per litre can still be provided by illegal cooks: for their raw material will be given them in vain.
It comes from "Bunkers", which captures the pipeline network across Ogoniland: In this way, experts throughout Niger say that at least 16 million litres of crude oil are lost every day.
However, only a small part of the provisional intermediate raw material disappears illegally: the lion's share of organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military, is filled with tankers and exacerbates them on the world market.
The debate, whether the environmental disaster is due to the revolutions of the population or to the lax production method, is held by the activist Akpobari for purely academic reasons.
"If oil companies were not considered to be intruders and had not destroyed the fish's life base so thoroughly, there was no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, the Ogoni's relationship to Shell has been destroyed, but so only a withdrawal of the Group has been called into question: "Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese are more likely to emerge."
Michael's gonna be nervous.
"The greatest time you're missing," says the muscular oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil refiners are acquired from the special unit of the fighting forces, they are not threatened with arrest, but perhaps a painful smear money.
The soldiers from the north of the country, like all Nigerians, want to benefit from the raw material.
"This damn joke has brought our country into every respect to the dog," Akobari says.
Discover dangerous baobaehler in A380-drives
The A380 obviously has a major security problem.
Researchers have discovered a possible baobaehler in the investigation of a non-resident machine that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The Qantas Fly will now report to the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of Qantas-Airbus were apparently much more fortunate in early November than they have been in the past: the Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in the engines of some A380 machines in its investigations - and now warns of a possible boomer.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil pipeline connection, it could cause fatigue and leakage, as stated in an opinion of the ATSB authority published on Thursday.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure".
Affected were engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus, which had to notland on November 4th in Singapore.
The Australian airline has now launched legal steps against the British turbine manufacturer.
It founded an Australian court in Sydney, which allows it to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas Chief Alan Joyce said his airline will require compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
At the engine fire, parts had been dissolved and the wear surfaces were damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire as a cause of the damage.
In the meantime, up to 40 engines must now be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that further safety tests should be carried out on the superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation was the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesperson Martin Dolan.
The safety problem has been considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left about three of its eleven A380 on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine with an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-stock flyer is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National snowfall triggers traffic noise
Germany in white: Over the night snow has fallen almost all over the country.
On many roads chaos, trains and flights fall off.
In the case of car accidents, at least three people died.
The winter freezes Germany: At icy temperatures, almost the entire Republic is joined at night on Thursday - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and the east, there are partly 15 centimeters thick snow cover.
On several motorways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
At the A7 at Flensburg, the winter service was in use, but the constantly rising snow was not finished.
In addition, heavy bows were anchored over the eastern coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) is expected to be on the east coast of Schleswig-Holsteins from the morning on storm currents with a water stand of 1.2 meters above normal.
In Saxony, snow travel on highways and federal roads caused major problems.
According to the weather-central Meteomedia, therefore, alarm level was violet in Switzerland – the highest level at all.
In part, there was 30 centimeters of snow, fresh and strong wind provided for travel.
Several trucks and cars remained there during the night.
In Sachsen-Anhalt, the police also reported major road disturbances.
On the A2 led snow and wind to stoking traffic and staus.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfalls.
According to German Bahn, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Northern Bavaria.
Snows on the slopes, ruined trees on the rails or damaged bridges and softs are the main problems.
In Saxony, the transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were provided by firefighters and rescue assistants with wool blankets, food and drink in the train.
Snowwinds were sinking across the streets.
On large German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous airports.
According to a speaker in Munich, some cancellations have already been reported.
In Frankfurt am Main, 40 flights have already been deleted, according to a French speaker.
The winter service is in continuous use.
Although only a few beached passengers are at the airport, they still have almost 400 beds.
On many roads there were accidents already in the middle of the Wednesday.
In the evening, an Lkw-Fahr came to life on a train on a train crossing in Eastholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to snow-covered roads: here too a truck was recorded on a train crossing because the vehicle remained stuck.
The driver came to life.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore blocked until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she had crossed the smooth road with her car at Askarenburg.
However, the meteorologists have a good message: Even though the snow will still be loose and powdery, it will cause light evils to fall.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is visited by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its trademark: According to a newspaper report, the money house is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could bring the property.
The Deutsche Bank has just made its Group seat attractive: the twin towers in Frankfurt have been modernised, while the banks have been allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group wants to recover the costs of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high houses, as the "Financial Times Germany" is calling for a speaker.
Reasons for the planned sale did not call the speaker.
"We always check whether it is more meaningful to own or sell properties and then rent them back," he said.
Thus Germany's largest credit institution will be re-subsisting its firm office in a short time.
The Bank had taken over the double towers only in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of a home fund and then carefully repaired them.
The energy conversion went down to about 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
Industry experts estimate the value of the tower currently renamed "Greenowers" according to the newspaper to some 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are resold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, the speaker said that the building is still open.
Thousands of mournings for a dead friend
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the scattered mountain glows that have been declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
Still, the bodies could not be guaranteed because the safety situation in the accident box is still precarious.
Almost two weeks ago, the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth came to an explosion.
29 mountain workers between the ages of 17 and 62 were displaced under days.
A sin was left in the box of misfortune, but no trace of survivors had been discovered.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue forces could be lifted for safety reasons.
After the second severe detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no longer any chance of survival for the team.
The bodies could not be guaranteed so far.
Now people and friends remembered a memorial feast to the dead.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered on the New Zealand South Island when the sun appeared shining in Greymouth.
For two minutes they swung.
In honor of the scattered mountains there were 29 tables on which were seen the helmets, lamps and the names of the companions.
Pictures and personal items, including clothing and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the country's government buildings, the flags were half-mast.
New Zealand hoped that the mountain shines would come back to the surface "from the depths of the earth", the New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said to the participants of the celebration.
"But they never came home."
He could not finish with the death of his son, until he had seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the grave.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the memorial celebration.
In the first explosion on November 19th, British and South African berths were also spewed.
Rescue workers began to wipe out a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gas is pressed, it will start to cool the glowing temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles said to journalists.
Go to hell, warrior!
Does Splater fit into the art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is re-launching old genre boundaries with his "Wallalla Rising" fighting epos.
Which audience would the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he turned Wallalla Rising?
A prisoner Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is free of his tormentors and is with almost superhuman forces, especially his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers in the search for bloody action, just because our hero likes to serve angry killing methods and his enemies already rips the dust out of the living body if he has bad laune.
On the other hand, Einöge says, as he is actually called, that the whole film does not say a word, and also the other figures can most often write one or two sentences or a few qualtful death screams.
Otherwise, the beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which the Viking world offers about a thousand years ago, is smothered.
Ideal for adults with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera trips.
Nice, if a movie has several target groups, it only harms if they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn since his wild and styled drug trilogy "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, however, refuses to make his works more humorous to the mainstream or to make something less brutal to the arthouse accessible.
Most art kino friends were allowed to be frightened by the sprinkling brain mass and the intestines.
The action fans will die for a long time at the latest when, for reasons that are freely interpretable, they break up a body of violent Christian missionaries by ship to Jerusalem and establish an eternity in flute and nebula before the crew manifestly arrives in America and continues to float there.
So no wonder that "Wallala Rising" in Germany has not found a movie rental and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is particularly sad because of the magnificent images, but also because behind the pretentious to bloodthirsty facade a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
In this film, it is not about dialogue or hard action, it is all atmosphere, a filmed fever dream.
And there's no way out of it for the viewer.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and ties him with his icy images and the window trance-like soundtrack quite slowly to the throat, but especially with the incapacitating hate that contrasts him from the heart of the figures.
Only a little blonde boy, who is faithful to the side, is preserved as innocent, all others are driven by anger.
At most of the simple hero whose motive is never explained, but for enemies and temporary allies will eventually become the warrior of hell, perhaps the messenger of the devil himself.
It means destruction, but perhaps only for those who are without corruption.
Wallhalla Rising is a fascinating film that can be hated and admired for the anger, excitement and shock.
An experience.
Resolved land-based work
The IAEA Atomic Energy Authority has new guidance on a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country, however, refuses to take a position on this - nor can it control it.
On Wednesday 5th to 6th September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I combat aircraft attacked a mysterious, werewolf-shaped building in Syria.
It is located on the shore of the Euphrates; the next largest city, 30 kilometres away, is Dair ash-Saur.
Your name appears in the documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built with the help of North Korea in the quader hidden in a valley that flows from the stream.
According to a letter from the CIA Foreign Secret Service of late April 2008, the reactor running under the name of the nearby town of el-Kibar would have been well suited to produce a plutonium - from which nuclear weapons were built.
For other purposes, however, the technology is barely volved out of the five-digits.
The CIA conducted a video presentation with unscrupulous satellite images.
By computer animation, it blended into which components of the reactor were to have been before the destruction, which is a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon Atomic Center.
She also presented photos showing the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor was just before the launch, but it had not yet been dealt with with burners.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, it's hardly known more than then, yes, the puzzles have become bigger over time.
The former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite certain that Syria built a reactor in el-Kibar, but could hardly see that there was "an active nuclear programme" in the country.
Some secret agents in Europe are even more cautious and speak only of a "probably reactor", even if they hold the CIA presentation for "plausible".
You lack hard evidence, just like the IAEA.
Asked how certain he was to have a reactor ahead of him, a high UN diplomat in the summer answered only Lapidar, which the IAEA has "enough material to ask questions".
The protection of the alleged "unused military building" created the acidic side fairly and planned the site thoroughly.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team was found under former Chief Inspector Olli Heinone in El Kibar traces of Uran, which was produced by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received from a Member State satellite images of commercial suppliers from the time immediately after the attack which should be more pronounced than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not to be obtained on the market because the unknown customer - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always appreciated never doing a secret nuclear program or having built a reactor.
The Uranium came from the Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
However, this was shown by the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss this - as well as satellite images.
It also rejects the controllers a second inspection in el-kibar and access to the drums of the bombed building.
But Israel also bows down to iron.
"We will never comment on this," recently confirmed Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position at the time of the attack.
As a result, the investigation of the case has been ineffective since June 2008 and "has increasingly developed into a serious credibility issue for the Authority", as a high Western diplomat at the IEA headquarters in Vienna, a serious breach of the IEA nuclear-weapon-weapon treaty in the area over which the IEA is awaiting.
As a key to progress in the clarification, the IAEA obviously sees three other institutions that should be "in functional connection" with the needed reactor - and other than this, still exist.
The inspectors have not so far revealed which facilities they are dealing with or which function they have or which they appear suspiciously.
According to information from the South German newspaper, they are referred to internally as Marj as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah at the IEAA.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these sites and discovered a building complex on satellite images at Masyaf, where it is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or near a military base - precisely with this justification, Syria of the IAEA rejects access to the three places.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will be sent by the United States to spy out military installations.
Because the nuclear reactors have become a source of attention to the institutions through a tip from the US Home Services.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that material was transferred between the three locations and the frame at the Euphrates.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the facilities could be "in connection with fuel production".
However, there is "no indication of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes needed to build nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb should be removed later, there are at least plausible suspicions about these central issues.
It is also unclear whether drummers that could raise valuable traces were stored in three places.
As the hundreds of cargo shipments had disappeared from the ground, no one wants to have information about where the protection was left.
The saltmine al-Tibni, located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria has examined in 1998 as a suitable warehouse for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely.
Former IAEA Inspector Robert Kelley recently contacted the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, recordings from the Orbit show that Syria did work on the three suspected sites and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but it has barely contributed to eliminating the suspicion.
Furthermore, in diplomatic circles, the IAEA has used several months to develop a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only the effort shows the importance of inspectors.
Indess, Damascus also proposed this proposal.
If Western diplomats in Vienna were weighed down a year ago, the reactor was destroyed, so the matter has not been very urgent, for example US ambassador Glyn Davies has been carrying out so-called special inspections in the game for a few months, one of the strongest means the Vienna nuclear authority has to carry out.
IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", but he is still reluctant.
There is a high risk in this way: for one, there is a need for a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and some of the 35 countries represented there are all other than emphatically on an escalation.
To others, how can a diplomat say, "What if they don't find anything at all?"
Love in Times of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her nameless estate in the summer, there are problems.
The spinbook itself wrote a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Much more you don't know about it - but that's enough for rest.
The rumor, the woman, a Muslim, is in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav war.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, after which some of the rotating days planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in the short term.
Meanwhile, the film is filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the organization of female war victims wrote about the UN Refugee Relief Agency UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actor, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is himself the ambassador of the UN Refugee Relief Agency.
She is not diplomatic - she has already offered the women a meeting in Hungary a week ago, which they refused.
The meeting had to take place in Bosnia, so Hasecic.
Love stories in the rape camps did not exist, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims betrayed her enough about the book.
Its organization has recommended to the UN Refugee Relief Agency to release Jolie as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got her to read the spinbook, has granted a rotational license for Sarajevo after all - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author himself admires that she does not pursue political intentions with her film, has worked hard in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, the content remains vague.
This is how a second synopsis of the film takes place in the network, which then sounds quite different: the lovers knew of it before the outbreak of war and met again, when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is dragged into a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What seems to be quite different from the "violence victims" version of torture.
That Jolies film actually starts before the war - so much is safe.
The pressure on them, as Jolie says, is "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now you can only afford the hackers of Hollywood peace: By putting the spinbook, like so many before, into the net illegally.
Nothing like this.
This evening, it is finally again running right around for the Irish.
No sign of trouble.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.

Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this shrill drinking game and the withholding computerist that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old is trying to amuse himself to get away from the boring question, what the future will bring.
On his plan there is no play at Las Vegas, he will conduct application talks in New Zealand in January.
"I have a hunch of feeling about it," he says.
"It's so far from home and I still don't have a job there."

100 000 Irish will probably leave the country in the near future, experts from the ESRI Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin predict.
By 2015, they are even counting on 200,000 immigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a huge loss.
If the forecasts are true, there is a wave of emigration comparable to that of Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of recovery, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, Tristesse is again expanding.
The economic crisis, in particular, insinuates the young, well-trained Iran, for which it has only been up until now.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.

In the Irish Times there are also letters from young immigrants who complain: "Everything goes down the river in Ireland."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - but who can go away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last one makes the light out."
Jura-Student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a dark future coming up because the government only operates eyewashing and gives young people no future prospects.

"For professionals, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career leader," says the manager.
On its website, photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a gale service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something somewhere else, Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year.
Because there was nothing more to be done for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they just pull up a fashion house.
In January it will continue to go to Hannover or Berlin, for the next project.
His home now sees O'Donovan only rarely, because he makes extra layers to pay the credit for his home.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says, when for a long time he goes over the threshold of his house for the first time.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am as good as ever."
He laughs a bit and goes through cool rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with decorated courtyards, in the entrance parks large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent credit financed.
"There were crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says.
Does he fear that it could go wrong with the credit?
O'Donovan spends a while throwing hot tea and says, "I don't have any children to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from New."
The construction engineer can't hear the whirring that he's hearing at the moment.
"No one has to starve - our situation is not as dramatic as it used to be here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst that can happen - perhaps it makes us feel like Irish."
He laughs and then tells of his father, who went to England in the last great economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back there and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Let the future be revealed and just look at how it goes with life elsewhere.
A few years' work in London has already been behind him, and why shouldn't it run well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
There is one thing that still bothers him in these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He's afraid it might look like a life-saving party.
"Just don't get too many emotions," he says and drinks a big blow from his beer.
"Well, that sounds scary."
"We prefer to call it a road party, very loose, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a few games."
The Democratic Routine
The democratic movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private enterprises.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
These results resulted in the Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly evident in this year's survey of September and October.
First the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased significantly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of democracy advocates rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong break-in last year, such a trend is to be recognised.
However, only half of the people in Mexico and Brazil, the richest countries of the region, are convinced that the regional average is lower (see Figure 2).
Some 44% of the respondents explained that they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, both last year and last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of the last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% or 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined the efforts of more democracy.
This also happened during the global economic crisis, perhaps because the countries of Latin America have only experienced a short phase of recession and have recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were captured by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America increased only slightly and 32% fell again this year.)
But from country to country there are strong differences in mood (see diagram 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the distinguished president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in widespread thinking of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and increased violence, this is less the case.
For the second time since the beginning of the survey, many people in Latin America have seen a greater problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see Figure 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they or a family member have been victims of a crime in the last year. However, compared to 38% in the last year, the values have decreased and thus reach the lowest level since 1995.
The increasing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support for the private and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents over the region indicated that the private sector was indispensable for development, 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can make progress in its country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left president, Hugo Chávez, has published many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year) Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
On the other hand, people in Mexico and most countries in Central America see the most influential country in the United States, taking over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
A selection
No one expected the elections on November 28th in Haiti to be perfect.
But the facts far outweighed the fears of the voters, who sought to help the affected country.
Overfilled polling hours, multiple votes cast, rhinestone ballots, destroyed lobbying and intimidation were only part of the problems.
Wahlokale opened with a long delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the earthquake in January, fought around looking for a choice.
Some finally gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including a number of conscientious top-level candidates, wanted the election results to be deleted due to a alleged fraud.
There have been partial violent protests throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the leader of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "as good in many interests".
According to a careful statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community "make these irregularities as seriously as they may be, the process is not necessarily invalid".
In other words, the show goes on.
The election authority, which is supposed to be committed to the unpopular separatist president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected selection is announced for January.
There's still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap-musicer Michel Martelly and the former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial complaint of invalidity.
If Jude Célestin, who finds only little or no consent among the voters, declares by the electoral authority that he is the winner of the election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the victims still live in tents, a small electoral participation was feared.
On the election day, many Haitians were prevented by lack of organization from paying their votes.
Shortly before the election began, approximately 250,000 demonstrations needed for the election were not yet distributed.
There's a lot on the game.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognised government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are the same opinion.
Homely in the middle
In the weeks following your husband's sudden death, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that has driven its popularity rate by 20 points up to over 50%. This is the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, if you help this to a re-election next year, it depends whether the apparently grieving Cristina Fernández is compromise-prepared than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
The signs for this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also led economic policy after his wife's election, often presented budget plans that did not fully take into account tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the president's couple to spend extra income on their own merits.
On paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in the congress last year.
However, the opposition was divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further defeats.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (where one parliamentarian fell in the face of another and others saw the government of the siege), the Congress was unable to adopt the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss it," said the President.
The 2010 budget is now also valid for the next year, which gives the President an even more opportunity to spend money on his own merits.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
For example, the official inflation rate is 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage requirements of trade unions - drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the office in 2003, when Argentina was protected by economic crises, explained growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, and not inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, scanned the private sector, and purified the National Institute for Statistics and Population Index, which then pleased official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández take a lower path now?
She called the private sector and the trade union leaders for talks.
And according to official statements, wage increases will be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
Inflation, however, undermined the growth gap by a major devaluation in 2002.
Maybe Cristina Fernández wants to go back to the rest of the world financially for this reason.
At the beginning of this year, the government entered into an agreement with securities owners who had refused to repay the country in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to insist on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The churches had always rejected a review by the IMF, as usual.
But in the last month, Minister of Economic Affairs Amado Boudou announced that the fund would provide a new national consumer price index for "technical support". It seems that this would be the first step to clean up the index.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active even after the end of her term of office without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle layer, which most of it has enough of the church.
If the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of the sympathy they received will be abandoned.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether to silence and lift many political decisions of her husband.
Weakapplaus for China
Taiwan voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan hold from his great brother beyond the seashore?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, which are 70% of all voters, took up to elect mayors and city halls in the five urban districts. This is valued as a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the construction of railway-related business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma itself is a symbol of relations to the mainland. Her policy has changed the relationship to the Chinese country for the first time since 1949.
Ma has passed the test, but only recently.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) is the fifth of the five mayors, she did not receive a majority.
Instead, the Democratic Party for Progress (DPP), which favours greater independence in Taiwan, received almost 50% of the votes that KMT received 45%.
In the case of a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even entered the streets along with the KMT.
During the election, there came to the usual events in Taiwan, such as cargo convoys with cranes, flag-sweeping masses, and only particularly dressed dancers.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious attempt to kill.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and the honorary president of the KMT held a speech on a KMT candidate on the night before the election,
When a man shot him in the face from the crowd, he was wounded, and a man of constant lookout was killed.
Bizarrer pointer is not clear whether the shooter killed lien or wanted to argue with the candidate.
Regardless of this, the attack has, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, affected the election and turned the DPP into a bad light, which the KMT has protected more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Significantly, relations with the mainland have not been the subject of discussion.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not want to give priority to its relations with the government in Beijing.
However, this time also avoids the DPP, the anti-Chinese feelings to be much scarred.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
But he would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese support their Chinese policies.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of withdrawing Taiwan with economic incentives into the Community.
China immediately sent a retailer to Taipei to prepare a summit for investment security and medical cooperation.
Of course it also wants political integration, but the most important.
It therefore prefers to wait until the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now come up again.
Two years ago she was severely weakened: the former leader Chen Shui-bian sat in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he was very much in favour of absolute independence.
But under Tais Regent, a new generation of decent politicians developed and the DPP fought for the voices of professionals and young people.
Tsai, as a presidential candidate for the DPP, found great agreement, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything to show that she is also able to build close relationships with Beijing.
Tsai plans an idea as a point of contact between the DPP and China, but this presupposes unpredictably discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that its party offers a "confidential alternative" to mass faster approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell he explained that the candidates of the DPP had done better to maintain independence on Taiwan.
He even called on Pragmaticer Su to refuse the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen's involvement, the DPP is difficult to choose its potential candidates.
The KMT will have to undertake its own own analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead their election without it.
The main reasons for his infidelity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing gap between the poor and the rich.
According to a KMT speaker, he will redesign his cabinet as well as the local institutions.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan only supports a limited recovery.
At the same time, most Taiwaneses see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no return anymore".
Grammy nominations: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the category Newcomer of the year
If you appear at the request of a president, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to attend the ceremony on the occasion of the 2009 Nobel Prize Award. Now the 26-year-old jazz assistant and singer were nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer category of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star since her 2008 album "Esperanza" in the Jazz scene, the nomination appears a little unusual. However, it complies with the Grammy rules that an artist may have published at least three albums prior to the release of the album, with which he was known in the general public.
Her ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her excited voice and a good sense of Pop, Funk and Latin Music, Spalding can be compared quietly with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 comes as a jazz interpreter in this category of nomination spaldings next.
In addition, the album "History" of the Vijay Iyer Trios was nominated in the instrument albums category. This was a great success.
Among the competitors of Iyer's are "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophoneist James Moody and "Posiotly" by keyboardman John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a rough favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category of Contemporary Jazz, where the other albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber can be found.
The Secret Society of Wild Steampunk-Musicer Darcy James Argue has received well-deserved attention in the category of Great Group. He thus joins the Billy Child's Emsemble with his chamber jazz and adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey leads in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daughertys "Deux Ex Machine" for piano and orchestra with five votes, and Steve Mackeys "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestra with three votes.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California, the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonics and launched in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer Avner Dorman, based in L.A., was also nominated for his Mandolin concert.
Classic nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
Five artists were nominated this year in the category of classical producers - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckners Symphonies No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daughertys "Deus Ex Machine" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackeys "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chor.
In the opera category, "Lulu of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hases "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Chor des Mariinsky Theatres; and Arthur Sullivans "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, Part for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty was nominated for "Deus Ex Machine", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionattot Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Hinderer" for a Grammy.
Pärts Symphony No. 4 was released and recorded at the Disney Hall on 4 January by the L.A. Philharmonics under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salons.
The approximately 30-minute piece bears the title "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondoline Concert" received a nomination in the instrumentalsolo category with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. reported that he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the Mandoline artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
The director Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category orchestra award for a recording of the works Strawinskis with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As instrumental soloists, pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, Geiger Julia Fischer and Harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
This year only women were nominated as vocalists, including Anne Sophie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category Classic Crossover, Soprano Jesse Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Moscow in Temecula wins the approval of the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula was followed by a five-hour, often hot public hearing, the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee.
Critics proposed the project to promote both terrorism and traffic.
However, according to a statement made by the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre is in line with local regulations and will become an aesthetic perspective.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, I'm proud of it."
"It shows that justice reigns."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"In this valley, wonderful people live."
The meeting began at 6:00 p.m. and the discussions on and against the construction of the centre lasted almost until midnight, with the votes distributed on both sides according to the press enterprise quite evenly.
The debate was continued on the website of the newspaper.
"There is no America anymore," said one comment.
"It's another planet of the monkeys, and the state of freedom is dead in the sand."
"America is at the end."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on September 11, 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for violence.
His community with about 135 families has lived peacefully in the Riverside County for years. But they wanted a bigger and better place than the camp they rented together with a water filter plant manufacturer.
The new, approx. 2,300 m2 large mosque in the Mediterranean style should have two minerals and become about 13m high.
It is designed to form on the approximately 17,500 m2 large plot at Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsen-resistant microbes could allow new forms of life on earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign type of bacteria that can live by arsenic, among other things, opens up new opportunities for new forms of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists have discovered this unusual bacteria here on earth, it is in their view a sign that life is possible even without the elements considered to be vital.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic."
"This makes it something very special, although it is almost a kind of 'foreign' form of life," explained Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online issue of Science magazine.
So far, six main elements have been considered as vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as scientists discovered, the bacteria in the California Mono Lake grow even further when it replaces phosphorus by arsenic.
"There you are wondering what else is possible," said the co-author of the Ariel D. Anbar report from Arizona State University.
Discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, since scientists must recognize life and its forms, as it were.
The study deals with microbes found on earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details of the discovery were disclosed gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could act on the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems organisms can launch biochemical processes with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements', which are absolutely vital to our opinion, are not necessarily determined," explained Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," said Cockell.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA's Astrobiological Institute, which conducted the study, chose the Mono Lake because of its high levels of arsenic.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically identical, she assumed that microbes that are both exposed may be able to replace one element by the other.
"The toxicity of arsenic is primarily based on the chemical behavior of phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so big that arsenic works differently than phosphorus. It reaches into our biochemical system, where it almost all melts," Anbar explains.
The researchers introduced the bacteria GFAJ-1 to an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, it also shows that an arsenic-based form of life can occur naturally, either on earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new. But until now there has not been a working example.
Arsen came more often in the early years, she says, so science has come to the conclusion that early life forms have used it.
"That gives reason for the assumption that life may have developed differently than in the early age of the Earth," said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
Research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The other two of the four dogs who were stolen from a Bellflower motel were found, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's statement, on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when unknown the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, in which the animals were placed before a Belflower Motel 6 night, as stated by the authorities.
Two of the dogs were discovered in the middle of the afternoon, and the last two of them were discovered in the middle of the night, says Steve Whitmore, a speaker of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is: the dogs are good," says Whitmore.
"They're in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not make accurate information about the dog’s founding site yet to the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigations are still ongoing."
"We don't want to say that anymore," Whitmore explains.
"We're following some leads."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available on Thursday for information.
They took their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon in a district home in Downey.
The sheriff's representatives found the delivery cars and the two dogs in different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old rüde, and Didi, a 10 months old dog - were reportedly unharmed.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, Rickard and Peek wanted to present this week on behalf of their Japanese owners at the competition, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were present this weekend because of the AKC/Eukakuba National Championship in Long Beach in the city because Trace should participate in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions the days before the AKC/Eukanuba Show.
South California is a stop on the almost one-month tour of the pair of dogshows to dogshows.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stayed in motels and park their delivery cars in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer world, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - with their motels.
The thick Akitas and Corgis stayed in the truck because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen on Tuesday at 6:00.
Peek promised anyone who could give a reference to the Corgis a finder's reward. The animals were implanted microchips for identification.
On Thursday it was not yet established whether a finder's pay was paid.
The lion breaks again after the approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New York competition judge officially approved the "prepared" faith plan to cover the debts of $5 billion and the 86-year-old entertainment company to prepare the way for new films and TV shows.
According to Thursday's statement, the plan meets the requirements of the US competition law, so that the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, is no longer in the way. Barber and Birnbaum are presented to the somewhat speculative studio as the main business leader.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 actually enters into force only when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned loan of $500 million to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself brings $75 million, leads the company. Financing is expected to be up to mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the mandate of the Investment Bank Moelis & Co, the company manager who fought interest payments of $300 million/year to help solve their financial problems.
In August, Managing Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, who was known for his activity at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve MGMs' financial concerns and pay out more than 140 believers in the studio lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided to offer the company at the end of 2009.
But the auction only attracted a few bidders and no one wanted to pay $2 billion required by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything began earlier when the MGM team began with the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after months of debate and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has officially won the competition in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million-dollar bonus for their work.
The share of Moelis & Co. that has already received $1.2 million is $9.5 million.
Cooper, which was paid monthly for the company's management of $375.000, receives a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year the studio brought out only one film and created an annual plan with seven or eight films to come to the cinemas in early 2012.
They also plan two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate loan between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share of these two films to be created under Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed approximately 18% of MGM-Darlehen, tried a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any results.
Tech Toys holds your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can ride a considerable hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic jumping lines or about 48 doses Play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, I was looking for three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wolesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had come into force. This year the technology players are more efficient and at the same time cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear on their own website, you will find a wider offer of this kind, webkinz and Club Penguin.
More and more button cells-operated toys come on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise specified, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years of age) are pluschfigures, as big as sea pigs who sing a note when pressing on their belly.
Once press corresponds to a note, through multiple press you can play a song.
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in Harmony.
Attention: If you start with the press once, you can no longer stop.
The Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice for a combination of songs and dance.
On the basis of the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers exchange games such as 'Simon says', and thanks to the innovative scarf feet with wheel-blocking it dominates the Moon-Walk.
Children who test the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning games.
Now he's back there (Hasbro/Playscool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of questionnaires, with which a car ride can become a lesson lesson, with a better experience with self-correction function as a teacher.
If you don't want to trust your child's smartphone, there are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qvaluey keyboard. However, the games included on it are not as educational as on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with the first major revision of the Leapster series with a new, brighter screen.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL of Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not larger than a string wooden box and have their own LED screen.
The game is to combine the blocks with words before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised letter competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go alone after the offer in the playgrounds, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal at the Penguin Club, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Package ($5 for children from 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the online code, your child will receive sufficient credits for two more parts at the Penguin Store Club.
It can be a roller shoe or a puddle animal.
The latest head cell microbot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The caper moves quickly to 12 vibrating silicone bands in any direction.
It's a pleasure to send him out of the castle by an errorgarten.
And he's holding a few.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even spent some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police initiatives in China are becoming softer
As a training officer, Tang Shenbin walked over a city square, checked his nervous subjects and gave orders with military authority and damp voice.
He wanted his female members of Chengguan - China's toughest guards of urban order, afraid and despised for their arbitrary approach and their attachment to violence - to impress the audience.
"Stand right there!"
"Look straight!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how beautiful girls are!"
Four girls, barely growing up to the teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white strips.
"For me, they look on average," said Mr Tang.
"Models are beautiful."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the gray plains.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by low-stars: in 2009 it was reported that 50 officials had an inadequately installed imbibscar and aimed at the operator until it packed up after half an hour and left the space.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been strengthened by the urban police force. They have been specially selected because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They're supposed to give the brutal police a softer, feminine aspect.
Sadly, however, Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commands.
Right, so the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials may enforce urban laws only by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in the province of Hubei beat a viewer to death when he filmed with his phone how they shot a protest station against a mullhlade.
Last year a textbook of Beijing officials was stolen and published online, describing how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai Watermelon Dealer suffers from a number of brain injuries.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China in an attack on street dealers.
"Chenguan scares the government," the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, after further controversy about tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "very thorough purification".
Skeptics find the current approach clearly insufficient.
When the District looked for eight female recruits in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether women should have real jobs or only as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
Women from 18 to 22 years of age with good figure and "harmonic facial features" were sought, according to a job announcement.
You should be above average size - more than 1.5 m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with the reaching of the 26th year of life.
According to officials, the activity for women over 25 is too intense.
"The most important is her image", an unnamed district official reported on the almost government website Rednet.com.
"If the candidates get the job, it first depends on their appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc.."
Then come temperament and inner qualities.
"Societal Chengguan are like flowers," he said and added, "but they also have other duties".
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Head of the City Administration of the District, does not wish to undertake this description,
However, it was noted that in China, the size standards for both sexes are not uncommon.
The same applies to uniform face-to-faces.
Whether to compare it with a good look is disputed in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disorders do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we can't use mud or garbage here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols in the Baoguang square near a monastery, is 22, has apple covers and a well-formed mouth.
She didn't feel like a sessistic, that so much value is put on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic view.
Her colleague with the grübchen, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their statements, they do not regret the short attitude, as they had more ambitious career plans than simply sneaking through the gases to prevent them from doing business.
Each morning, the strips deal with about twelve street dealers who try to sell as many pieces and tofus pretzels as possible on foot or on the bike before they are pursued.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We've told you this so often!" explains Fr. Xu, a dealer who had escaped on foot and had left his noodle kitchen temporarily stuck on a bicycle car.
According to the officials, the activity is rather monotonous.
"It's almost the same every day," says Huang Jing, 20, who studies sales in leisure.
"All Routine."
One reason is that women officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of traders, like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male superiors.
This is intended to protect them from public enemies who are often exposed to officials in China.
This year, hundreds of people from Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, randalized after the news, Chengguan officials had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen policemen and Chenguan officials were injured in the night, 14 government vehicles were dropped or burned.
Xindu has been eliminated from such violence so far.
But unrest is not to be excluded.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baongang square, where the women's officers patrolled this morning, gathered more than 50 people on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle which was repaired instead of in a workshop.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After a 15-minute drive, the officials turned their way to their vehicles and drove on with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a co-ordinator of the male strips, remained back. He turned around his white name sign to remain anonymous.
Like her colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
"Many times but also physically," explains Mr. Li naked.
"Most of the time people start fighting."
Senator Ensign will not be charged
Public prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have released Senator John Ensign from the charges, who, after his case with a former election assistant and his attempt to give his husband a lobbying activity, were picked up against him, the senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious legal challenge against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal that has taken place across the country and has created a damper for his career, he was considered a potential candidate for the Republican presidency for 2012.
As Senator Ensigns' office announced, he was "highly pleased" with the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate's Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensigns, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that investigations against Senator Ensign had been conducted and that there were no further charges in this case.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In your opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign missed the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents published for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times gave rise to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election assistants, was involved in unchristian orders to purchase his silent business with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked as a treasure master during an election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to provide Hampton with work. According to the documents and interviews, he took over for them after setting up Hampton's lobby.
Since Hampton was recently in Ensigns' election team, he was not allowed to take up lobby work for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethical experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close to the affair, was opposed to the so-called prohibition of turn-door lobbying.
According to the published index, "all seem to be a deal and a violation of the door-to-door status," says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who stand in the government's vision.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical fences said that the Ministry appeared very cautious in the prosecution of political charges following a number of cases that the media had been very interested in, including the decision last year, to drop the charges against the former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct by the State attorney.
Public prosecutors "are obviously horrendous," said Melanie Sloan, president of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organisation whose aim is to combat corruption in the US parliamentary and governmental circles), a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr. Ensign before the court.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview, he received a phone call from a public prosecutor on Monday and another day on which he was informed that the Ministry would not raise complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensigns had cooperated with the state prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law".
Mr Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he had put before the prosecutors.
"I'm not sure I'm going to go into the details of the conversation between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only if you say so: we believe that we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to set up investigations on the basis of a separate complaint by the Ethics Group after a payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to Hamptons against the Federal Election Act.
The electoral commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that had long supported the senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton was found thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyist work.
An e-mail from December 2008 states that after Mr. Hampton had passed on as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings Stabbsef, John Lopez, had an intrusion with Mr. Hampton, in which he informed him that he was at the Ministry of the Interior because of a matter "acclapsed".
Mr. Ensign also agreed with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after this Mr. Hampton had set up lobby work.
For the first time in the last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his electorate for bringing information about this affair to the public and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had stood in the ranks of the Republicans in fourth place.
After many months he was no longer incarcerated, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he sought a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the goal of police investigations, his press speaker, Jennifer Cooper, hoped that the Ethics Commission would follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and set up his investigations very quickly.
"Sentator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire calls on Twitter
Half a dozen of them dived into the streets in the courtroom.
In a minute attack, they sent their reports on the cruel testimony on Twitter.
In the end, so the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and begging children in a house that went into flames.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of having killed three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the trial on the death sentence that the jury has pronounced falls.
However, Mr Hayes' lawyers have already filed applications before the Court for reasons of appeal and the courts will be occupied for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intensive reporting of the process - including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - has come to a "circuit atmosphere" and so widespread, immediate penetration of intelligence details, so that the jury has been unduly influenced by public equipment.
This opposition could be brought before the Court of Appeal to deal with the question of whether new technologies would be required for new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced during this process, I believe that it is really a danger when the introduction of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of each individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, chief defender of Mr. Hayes.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue, of the Supreme Court of the Chamber, said last week that the applications by decision were short and binding when he said that the new media would be "supervised carefully" and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court rulings have found that the report on famous cases has raised doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In his historic decision of 1966, the United States Supreme Court ruled against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopathian from Cleveland who was supposed to have killed his wife, saying in his decision that there would have been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media.
Some believe that the TV series and the game film "On the Flight" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court rulings, which Mr Hayes considered a half century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communication routes from the courtroom, which were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the new media in processes that are being pursued by a wide public," said John J. Donohue III, Professor at Stanford Law School, who has investigated the death penalty in Connecticut. His report says she will be voluntarily suspended.
Professor Donohue said some appeals courts could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of an immediate communication from the courtroom could make the proceedings fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many who present Mr. Hayes' lawyers to discuss the matter over years and thus make a statement of conviction.
For example, the defendants also claimed that Mr. Hayes could have already been convicted, when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jury members by showing them gruesome tattoo photos during the jury selection.
Some of the jury said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and her daughters, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, would have met with abscheu.
The defendants say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty Constitution and argue that the judge has wrongly exchanged a jury that was a critic of the State Prosecutor and that he would have unduly put pressure on the judge when he made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jury wasn't isolated.
However, their arguments about the influence of the detailed report on the process may be of the greatest interest.
In a verdict they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and discussed during the election for the Governor's office and the US Senate by the candidates.
They argued that the new media had continually re-evaluated the flames of emotion over the case.
"This day-to-day trend of media pipers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "have not experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even across the country."
Its focus on reporting by Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages were higher than reports, which are less slowly replaced, was a technically hostile view that weakened the reporting on future processes.
However, some lawyers said appeals courts would often be confronted with the argument, social and technical changes would require adaptation by the courts.
Mr Hayers' lawyers are strengthening this claim.
In their objection, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which the judgment of Dr. Sheppard was lifted on the basis of the report and made it clear that the new media required new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can Courtesy connect the separation?
After a campaign of gossip and negativity this week, there is little courtesy in Washington.
Is it a real bilateral cooperation or a moment of illusion before you return quickly to fight the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the summit of the Congress did not lead to a major breakthrough in the so-called "lame Duck session" of the session at the end of a period of government in which decisions were no longer taken.
After all you hear, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides or a consideration of their shared responsibility to rule, but rather an empty episode of a partial collection.
The public meeting of the President's Deficit Commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that continue to exist between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months creates a mutual respect that distorts the ideological struggle that continues to divide members.
This is hardly enough to claim that there was a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise is called for, while one tries to weigh the limits of public opinion and the voter's patience after a renewed party war.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, donations, health or expectations, the two sides are miles apart.
Finally, the November election in Washington has at least voted mildly for a short time.
"No question, the sound has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, who is now working for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections generate partial passions that die again.
And that's good."
In some issues, especially in those on the agenda of the "Lame Duck session", Republicans and Democrats have hardly any choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports it.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, whether it's temporary or permanent.
Similarly, there is a compromise to be expected on the increase in unemployment, although only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the preferential tax reductions for the rich are being made, while they refuse to support the unemployed.
After meeting on Tuesday in the White House, optimism has increased that one can agree on these issues during the "lame Duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
However, William Glaston of the Brooking Institute warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the Lame Duck session does not necessarily lead to permanent cooperation of the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, as he says, a phase of non-conformity is more likely, perhaps even impossible.
"After the things that have to be done are done, this short-term psychology will be turned into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this schepsis is shared by many - leads to genuine cooperation.
"I see a lot of what is happening from today to 2012 as a pre-fighting, or shadow boxing, for the 2012 main event," he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the opening up of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the Teeparty voters who were well educated.
As the Republican leaders are concerned, they may also be too high for poker, they know they have to try to keep their promises, reduce government spending and put health reform aside.
These party lines are already clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include a tax reform and the lifting of some taxes and the lifting of the pensioner and the reduction of public expenditure.
The vice-presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have so much pressured them to put the deficit on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission in order to make their plan for official recommendation and they are fighting a lot to get even closer to this number.
The largest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the board, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little space or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston says two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans at the Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes when the Republicans Obama challenge the state budget, tax and health system, later followed by a phase of greater bilateral cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proved that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still wish that the two parties work together.
If confrontation leads to a gas, as in 1995, both parties must pay attention to the public response.
Anyone convicted of losing will have to change the course and look for compromise.
This may in fact be an optimistic view.
Participation and polarization are now greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and the Congress Republicans than between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a clear example of a much broader choice in 2012.
This is how many Americans can welcome the kindness that is shown this week.
However, on both sides, much more effort will be required to find a common denominator in the issues that the two continue to separate from each other.
Perfumed US document depicts Moscow as a port of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of the "Cleptocracy" and it gives part of the bribery and protection money it collects to the Kremlin. Thus in February the American message in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the State Security Service are paying high protection fees so that they can maintain their precious standard of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate business, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "Vertical Authority" - takes part of the money that the leader moves up.
The memo sent under the name of Ambassador John Beyle to Washington was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accused him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly any evidence that it would have been cleared in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected corruption proposals over the years, and he has won numerous insults against such accusations.
In September he explained to a Russian television channel when he was asked for a documentation that suggested he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual that, as in the Ambassador's report, individuals are named, and it is not surprising that this is done by a diplomat in a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the Moscow government with crime has led some to call it "distorted" and conclude that the government acts rather than a government," said the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / the Mafia, which literally means "dach" or protection), which extends to the police, State Security (FSB), the Service Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the Office of the Public Prosecutor as well as to the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-dimensional structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov stands in the highest position."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage."
"Lastly, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city offers no help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB is cashing out of the biggest companies and that the police are arresting small business people.
A source, that is, "declared that Moscow's business owner understands that it is best to obtain protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organised crime), as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer asked as before."
The memo notes that while the collection of money is comprehensive, protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who don't pay, they find their business closed very quickly - because of some prejudice.
Medvedev has repeatedly talked about combating corruption, but at the same time has noticed that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men going into the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said George Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of the forces, as he says, corruption is inevitable.
The country-wide corruption is estimated to cost Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranked 154 on a new investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-State organization Transparency International (countries are listed from "at least corrupt" to "at most corrupt").
The revelation of the memo of the American message, which took place after Moscow's time late in the evening, will surely trigger errors within the Russian government, although since Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow's error, it can also be a possibility for the Kremlin to claim to solve the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that WikiLeaks documents could be a mistake and responded in anger to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that our interaction is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we wouldn't have expected this to work with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans forced to face the past
In a weakly lit, accentuated classroom with dirty and dazzling walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Srng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges that have developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the capitalization of Khmer Rouge against the government, long-year followers are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed the victims the public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that tells the story of Khmer Rouge for the first time to children of former soldiers.
And in July, a UN and Cambodian Community Tribunal condemned for the first time a former member of Khmer Rouge when it condemned the former head of the notorious Tuol Slang torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the duke, for 35 years in prison.
With all of these developments, fear grew among the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, making efforts to reconcile and reintegrate into the society of Cambodia.
"There is still denial and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent organization investigating the regime.
"For her life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It even splits families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, 1.7 million people were estimated to have been executed or died of diseases, processing or hunger.
When the Vietnamese fell apart and the Pol Pot-Ied government collapsed in 1979, the regime's remnant and its military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
Here they spread until December 1998, when the last movement capitalized, unrest.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the Guerilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok brought the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of the 1990s, when a peace agreement that was supported by the UN in 1993 led to the country's first democratic elections, large groups of Khmer Rouge started to move to the government, leading to the capitalizations of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not died, was arrested in 1999 by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh Prison, where he waited for his trial.
When their graces no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the devastating poverty of the rural Cambodian chess and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though some elite Khmer Rouge officials kept their local government posts because they put down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers.
"These people have only benefited very little from the capitalization," said Sok Leang from the centre of justice and reconciliation, which in whole Cambodia, also in Anlong Veng, holds public forums
"They are anchored in the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They grow up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974, fought for Veng in the jungle before leaving in 1998 to lead a life as a poor farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister to trial.
The order of the Court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not stated whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This has little to do with calming the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on Im Chaem, 64 years old, who during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s was district chief in the province of Manteay Meanchey.
In 2007 she had told the officials of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms, a project where thousands of forced workers were likely to die.
On a hot evening, the chaem returned from work on the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun had long shadows on the dried grass, it refused to discuss their past with the Khmer Rouge.
If the court asked her, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecution, war would be here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who escaped from Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would accuse more suspicious, although experts and historians are discussing this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to be able to move forward, Chhang Youk from the Documentation Centre said.
"Accommodation with the Khmer Times means bringing together the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put together these broken parts, so that you can understand everything."
The centre created the first school book approved by the government over the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history book for the Ministry of Education's High School, which contains fewer than four pages over the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Lang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court are reaching for influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Up in the Dangrek mountains, one of the smoldering and plasticized roads leads to a rectangle of black rust, covered with a rusty roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here after his death in 1998 on a tire.
Noum Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile salesman on the street, said she didn't know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last place of rest, where she will find a bush full of bananas - in the hope that he will bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to no longer collect weapons uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign for global nuclear safety, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical part of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus not to collect highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a height last spring.
However, officials of the U.S. government told Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements had been concluded with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons from a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Nuclar Summit of 47 Nations" since April, which had excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited by the fact that they wanted a seat at the Nuclear Safety Summit (from 2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure everything in four years' time.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to release their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear safety summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to maintain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weaponized, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we won't make dirty bombs out of it and we won't sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago when it showed interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first move to remove the Uran of Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly scattered, says official.
It was loaded into a special suit, which is more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, say official.
The second run was decided on Monday and was carried out by aircraft according to the official.
The U.S. government pays $14 million for these efforts, with most of the money flowing into Belarusian research with poorly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was very carefully coordinated and agreed to build trust," said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy working on Global Risk Reduction, to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Non-Prolonged Studies estimates that in this year, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of armed uranium as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus wants to dissolve its stock by 2012.
The relationship between Belarus and the United States has been strained for years, primarily because of the harsh disregard for human rights of Lukashenko.
But the status of Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
"The progress of these global security issues is welcome, the United States of America and Belarus announces that an increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections from the Spanish government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners over Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as reflected in a telegram by the ambassador of the U.S.A. in Madrid.
This reflects the documents transmitted by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El País" (by cable). It is added that former deputy government chief María Teresa Fernández de la Vega requested that the Spanish government be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft flying Spain are being adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which aid for human rights-related practices in a number of countries, including Spain, was accused, former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed themselves.
The Deputy Head of Government added that the Council's report "has met Zapatero aside" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed, Spain has no objections to the secret service flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed", not to be "unprecedented to be surprised", Aguirre reports per cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to give great attention to this matter, although the government has little influence because it is in the hands of the judges."
In January 2007, Public Prosecutor Vicente González informed the message that he would not block the initiative, the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Minister of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any burdensome or sensitive information," the ambassador explained after a discussion with the Public Prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the United States was more concerned about "probably coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the classified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts to deal discreetly with governments," Aguirre complained.
In a lunch in March 2007, when US ambassadors and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are very cleverly concerned about their independence and do what they consider appropriate," he instructed his employees to "absolute rhetorical comments in order to overcome tension."
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the conduct of the PP in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt the fact that the government of Zapatero's actions in the United States that could have been subjected to human rights violations, tolerated or deliberately ignored, capital will be struck, even if these revelations could have a negative effect on the government of the United States," he said.
The child killer stood on the Internet complaining about the "museum" of the motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in Galician Way"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this name, which she leads from small to small, she keeps with a cousin and at least a friend contact. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The notifications are from 2008 onwards.
To understand this, you need to know your loved ones who reconstruct the ABC daily newspaper based on testimony from their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman entered into a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrial worker in 1998.
She was a year old.
Shortly after she had dissolved her relationship, she was known to be pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his ex-wife never let him carry out a DNA analysis.
Soon she began to have a different relationship.
The chosen was Alberto, a young man from Lousama, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look after herself on the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the contents of her messages, it can be concluded that their love relationship broke and they broke up.
In March 2008, she is alone at Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very peculiar and angry because I came to work."
"When I told him, he found it good, but now he notices, of course, what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not be free to do and let him do what he wants."
Later she mentioned a message she just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month or let me get an address that I can send you to."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boys at my mother's, I'll pick him up when I'm back."
In May she says of her return to her village: "This week I will go there, but I will only stay there until the 19th, because I have to introduce myself to a job on the 20th, if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she'll take her first-born when it's all right.
"He will be with whom he must be, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him with someone other than my mother," a dubious intention when considering their bad relationship.
There's another mail in July.
When she writes it, it is assumed that the boy who arrived on the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"César is satisfied on the one hand, not on the other."
"On the one hand he's with me and the place he likes a little, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will visit a summer course, so I have less expenses for the girl."
On 17th: memories and complaints.
"A giant kiss by César who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. You see, if he wants, he finds me such a mess."
On the 30th, "The boy is doing well. He's going to a summer class to learn Catalan."
From Victor, her current partner, there is one: "He shoots money at me."
On the Internet, in anime and mangablogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now closed, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prison laser".
"Terrorism in the Gallega (Overwriting)".
The last man who lived with her, a determined hunter, explains to have a biscenes of conscience because he feels guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica was transferred yesterday from the centre of the prison to Menorca in Palma's provincial prison.
The defendant, Carlos Maceda, explained that she could not remember the outcome of the case, "and she had no intention of harming the little."
Before, however, she had stood up to drink César in the bath tub and to have his body in a suitcase.
Defence and public prosecutors applied for a psychiatric opinion.
Popular Party won 4 congress seats and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, the PP could play a crucial role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
According to the significant increase in votes and Members of Parliament in the last regional elections, the PP has already taken its view of Parliament's elections - or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party achieves in these elections is usually twice as high as in the Catalonia elections.
Thus, the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316.222 in the 2006 regional elections.
On the last Sunday, the PPC reached 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend - the result of the conversion of the PSC's vote and the binding of the electorate of the PP - should be maintained, the analysts of the PP predict that in the parliamentary elections, the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressional delegates, while the CIU also won four (now 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 (of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a member - it currently has three - while ICV would keep its members or could win one.
However, if the election calendar is maintained, the next date will fall with the municipal elections in May 2011. Also, the People's Party (PP) may be the tongue on the scale to prepare the socialist rule for an end, in four provincial cities and with its majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the city's largest budget administrations: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists cannot achieve a majority or take back their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not surprising that this party will lose its representation in the municipality of Barcelona in which it had to deliver 5% of the votes.
On the other hand, the PP recorded an increase in its vote in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the main role in Tarragona's revolution. There they had ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, along with the PP.
A Lérida is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Angel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Casteldefels or Reus, the People's Party was able to record a significant increase.
The PP is currently represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and aims to develop lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaida with thousands of travel passes
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three others in Thailand
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian secret police officers arrested by the Barcelona Police Department formed the Thai-controlled jihadist cells, the various Al Qaida groups, including the "Moving for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Thaiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the Atentata in Bombay, who claimed 2008 106 dead - with pashes.
The Spanish Interior Minister has a major role to play in these investigations, so far as he ensures that the "Operation Kampai" has been "weaked" and "so their ability to act" worldwide.
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cells were active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were faked and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida was composed, so that their "combatants" could freely cross the borders of European and other Western countries.
The discovered cell is not the only Dishhadist network that was active in Europe. Therefore, other European police units have also been involved in the investigation, with the exception of the Thai investigation bodies, and it is not to be excluded that similar attacks will occur in the EU field in the next few days, such as those carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another was carried out in Thailand, where Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt were arrested as well as the Thai Siriklaya Kijbumrumung.
They were led by Bangkok from the cells in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was destroyed in 2009 - was particularly steeled by tourists in accordance with the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents on the names of men aged 25 to 45 had to be issued and still had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to bear visa marks.
In the investigation circles it will be stressed that until now no connection could be established between the Catalan prisoners and the assassination in Bombay, although the author of this attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of the stolen and subsequently fake travel passports in Spain.
However, it should be recalled that several thousand dollars were sent to purchase prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were used later by members of the "Commandos", which was prepared for the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized extensive documentation.
PP calls for a meeting of the tax agreement from Mas
The President of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, yesterday, took the opportunity to personally propose their conditions to support his entry as President-in-Office of the Generality, which are not different from those already put forward during the election and can be combined with the priority of economic recovery and the abandonment of regionalist independenceists, such as a financial balance agreement proposed by regional leaders at the height of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan People's Party turned with confidence to Arthur Mas, who gave her the 18 Members she had won last Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to make her feel unconcerned. For the candidate from the Civil-Regional Party CIU is indicated that at least one of the opposition parties is present in the vote at its entry to the vote.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to join in the upcoming parliamentary elections depend on a possible agreement with the PP. However, the talks that the mass conducts with the rest of the party currently revolve around Catalonia.
With regard to the PPC chairman, he called for a back-up to support the entry of the office "all discourses relating to the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and an agreement on the financial compensation between the State and the autonomous region - like in the Basque country - and which the CIU leader even wants to give a referendum.
Both political leaders are of the opinion that they will make the proposed political apparatus of regional administration easier and want to abolish inheritance and gift taxes.
With the details of the negotiations on the entry of Mass, the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat are concerned.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a severe opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Old Testament confirms that deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the old house in Olot do not exclude that their manager killed more than eleven older people
The managers of La Caritat's old nursing home in Olot (Gerona) gave yesterday a press conference, in which they exposed the damage to the criminal actions of Joan Vila Dilmés - the supervisor who had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible during his work - added the institution.
The head of the old nursing home, Joan Sala, joined his lawyer, Joan Cañada, before the court, and announced that "La Caritat wants to accuse the responsible (for the death cases)", but "the right and our obligation of liability force us to accept the process and the civil liability".
The institution must not only take a loss of social security because it had not detected the criminal acts of the manager in time, but also now pay a high amount of compensation calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victim.
Joan Vila Dilmé has been told that the first crime will return to August 2009 and that he has been killed since then.
The judge arranged for the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - as he suspected that no doctor had examined the deceased personally, but the formalities were made by telephone due to their age and diseases.
The leader of La Caritat denounced this point round and explained that "the remaining measures could never have been the reason for the events."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there was no indication in the dispute of a person other than the accused."
The already baptized angel was 11 murders yesterday and explained that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 and half a month later killed the second old lady.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had given a combination of various medications.
The manager of La Caritat explained that the access of staff to medicines was only difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and the tranquilizer cocktail were used by the caregiver for six of nine crimes committed in order to free the patients with death from their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory tests will be shown whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victim or whether he burned it from the inside by handing them a pencil, as he said it was for three women he killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, there is no belief in the manager's statements, not even in terms of the number of standing murders that could be even more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila made very different statements before the court and that it makes no sense to change his behavior after eight successful murders suddenly.
They say they made themselves available on this basis and to clarify the scope of these cases of justice.
European Central Bank’s (ECB) debt securities
The investors reacted very strongly yesterday to the threat of the ECB President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our reaction capabilities."
The risks of the euro periphery countries have increased dramatically and the shares of the European banks have increased by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can deceive itself and that the euro has barely given up on points that cause concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an iliquitous market, which, to the extent that it collapses, recovers, however, due to the closure of shorter and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, one month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to withdraw our liquidity measures, to which the ECB had to withdraw for the fourth time in two years tomorrow, and probably a few more times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the end of the plan for the purchase of sovereign debt, since it was ineffective, as well as the abolition of all exceptional liquidity measures.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and the quarterly calls for unlimited access at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity will be maintained until at least June.
We also expect that the programme for the purchase of bonds will continue and a strong signal will be issued.
If the created expectations are not met, the excellent response of the markets will be rejected from yesterday and if we are hard pressed to take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As with the ECB meeting in May, in which the Bank confirmed that the purchase of sovereign debt securities was not considered and that the markets would then collapse, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed the teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the auction of single-year titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The state asset management accounted for only 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
However, the interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve and thus reflected a change in market perception according to the words of Trichetes.
In Ireland the figures of Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The amount is estimated to be approximately 10,000 million in the short term and possible additional 15 000. There is time until February to buy private capital or these banks are published.
Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after it did not recognize the problem with the stress test in July, the figures in the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday, the government must receive parliamentary approval of its new budget, and since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel made her speech more moderate in terms of the summit of the Heads of State and Government on 14 December. There is political unity asked to show that we play the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth symphony Beethovens.
The Spanish President presented yesterday the plan of action to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Rent reform, transparency in the autonomous regions, as well as in the financial institutions, the reduction of the state deficit, liberalisation, privatization and labour procurement measures.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has contributed 4.5 percent, doubles as much as the rest of the European stock exchange.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was fast and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a significant auction of a three-year public bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect. That is why we are calling for a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our debt capacity.
For Spain, the request for an aid plan would be a self-suffering sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The treasure has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be unlimited.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with the motto of Caesar's wife: "Now not only the Being but also the Light."
It's all we can do!
At the request of his children, the Chairman of the Board of Eulen called on Vega Sicilia's meeting
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owner of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not float away.
David Alvarez, founder of the company group, will challenge the association of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, as he considers them to be "absolutely useless". His children will be tried to obtain a majority to control the administrative organs of the company - the owner of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing the legal measures for a new chapter of justice in their dispute to control a part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding for business services does not appear to be prepared to report in his legal dispute to the authorities of El Enebro.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed as members of the Board of Directors at the shareholders' meeting of 18 January this year, which has already been registered in the Register of Commerce.
The El Enebro Society's meeting, convened by the Court of Commerce No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th time, triggered a new thunderstorm at the Alvarez family.
The call by the judge to convene the assembly is the only legal way that ensures the convening of the assembly.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz will be prepared by David Álvarez as a "debtly means of the applicants - his five children - to be recognized by legal peaks, fraudulent techniques and misuse of law for the undeclared assembly of 18 January", as official speakers explain.
This argument is the basis for attacking the assembly in the background to declare it "absolutely useless".
These same protagonists, who dwell in discreet silences, have already tried unsuccessfully in June to convene a meeting in the right direction.
At El Enebro - property company and owners of Bodegas Vega Sicily, in addition to other assets - control David Álvarez' seven children 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, the founder of the service group, according to family protocols, demands the right to use over 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background of the case on which the judge has decided in the hearing to deal with the complaint for which a date has not yet been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since the entry of Red Bull into the world of Formula 1, its history has been marked in this read universe by the speed of surprises and successes.
At first, no one gave the new attention and despite its steep rise in value during the last season, all at the end of November were on the victory of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without the ability of German pilot and world master Sebastian Vettel or the strength of the engine of Renault, the "Geheim gun", which the Multi Siemens Red Bull put into hands, has become a legend, creating a victory team.
In fact, it is a powerful software for the simulation of processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that do not have to do with authors.
This software program, known as PLM, was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy works and high-precise instruments.
A faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before it is actually built to avoid errors and excessive costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, the planes of Sukhoi and the most famous commercial vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' Industrial Department, explains that using this software in Formula 1 - Factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and perform the changes and improvements that are identified on the race and in the tests.
Russwurm argues that in 1992, on average, ten technicians were working in the stations, who could introduce at least three or four improvements in a season.
In the Red Bulls team today, 180 highly qualified young people are employed. With powerful EDV systems, they conduct analyses and all possible changes to the racing car.
The Siemens Manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all components of the Red Bull racing car, except for the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transmitted to reality by advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves within less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the simulator.
The only limit set by this crazy technical perfectionism is the 40 million dollars that a Formula 1 team can spend on its winnings in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a 50-km-long place from London.
It is two buildings in which visits - especially by journalists - are very limited.
Everything that's going on there is top secret.
The team includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls true Formula 1 - hero is undoubtedly the newest champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources put by the energy-drink manufacturer in the services of his participation in the race, other protagonists hide themselves, whose support is invaluable and their recognition is equal to zero.
The chief of technology at work, Steve Nevey, stressed that five years ago, progress in the field of F&E for racing cars was still being made by 50% and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed. Technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while the pilot's contribution is estimated to 15 percent.
Nevey admits that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV, because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will open twenty-one stores with local vendors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) presented his first exclusive shop in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a sales network consisting of twenty shops with 80 to 100 square meters each intended to open the multi in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees with the existing 16 sales areas in the wholesale industry, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of HP España, Helena Herrero, called as an example the refurbished cargo at the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, who has been working with HP for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010 including 20 divestments in Spain.
The first week was dedicated in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to betray the coming new openings, but did not conclude that Madrid could be the next target.
The vice-chairman, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of loading opening is always the same. It is based on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American Group advises on this and takes over the exclusive cargo equipment (with interactive products for handling); all shops in Europe will look the same.
HP is also responsible for training staff.
Helena Herrero said it's not a Franchising system and said that the exclusive sales network is intended to "optimise the customer service and the advice of small and small companies when buying and after, even the packaging."
The loading in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service builds a connection to the technical centre in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way we can solve problems in ten minutes that sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed in particular for small and small enterprises and private customers, as large companies have already entered into their service contracts for technical customer service," Helena Herro said yesterday.
Sabadell wants his rivals in three years a million customers to 'klauen'
Banco Sabadell's managerial board member, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for banks, but first, a new liquidity crisis and prophecy will end the debt war.
However, it foresees a break in the interest rates that banks are trying to offset by increases in fees and in the price of loans.
Sabadell expects to receive a million private customers in three years - a subject that still exists.
Sabadell has found the way to spend the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year management plan in 2011.
The objective is not only to survive without the public assistance from the FROB, but also to increase the market share of a million private customers - 700 000 if the customers who lose the bank are withdrawn. This is the great challenge that this bank faces, because so far it has paid more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year it has received 250 000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Their market share for private customers is 3.5 per cent, while business customers account for more than 10 per cent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is to increase productivity, speak austerity, cost reduction. The challenges facing the bank will be presented together with the Annual Final Report.
Only a few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has brought all the plans of the banks together.
Sabadell will complete its four years-old Optima Leadership Plan. It was originally designed for three years, but due to the market situation, it was extended for a financial year.
Customers who leave the savings are the main target of the bank.
With a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed, 2011 would be a "hard" year "with a great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain only "slow" comes out of the crisis.
Moreover, it would be "very difficult", in two or three years "to create work" - fundamental for the survival of the banks.
Even if it assumes that the war on liabilities, which is punishable by interest margins, will run out, the risk assessments that banks and savings have to pay for their emissions to maintain liquidity will already have to be offset by the price of credit for emerging gains.
"The topics of liquidity and financing are structural and they will exert pressure on credit."
"We haven't turned down the shark, but the interest differentials are very high," said Guardiola.
Banesto already issued the order on its branch network on Thursday, limiting the granting of long-term loans and increasing the interest differential (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager was also informed that the banks were currently pursuing the Stategy "to increase the fees", however "within a framework marked by competition".
Sabadell's lead plan is based on organic growth, even though the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business.
He does not, however, ensure that in Spain "larger companies are necessary."
"In the coming year everything will change," he assures.
He stresses that the need for capital is currently "greater" and does not imply that some Spanish financial institutions will be cut off in red numbers.
He is of the opinion that the FROB can replace the money market in capital stockpiles.
After ensuring that Sabadell can also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he deduces the argument of some banks already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stresses that nothing can be done, but unlike the events in June, it is possible to obtain short-term funding through repossessions and to cover the crisis.
CECA excludes a second fusion wave of the savings boxes
The CEO of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a merger wave of the savings banks and stressed the speed with which the sector will be restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings did not take part in the first phase. They held the second round.
On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish Savings Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that the majority of the mergers are completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, rather it was an adjustment."
"The main part is completed. It may be that we have instead of seventeen or fourteen, but all important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all operations."
In a breakfast organised by the Association of Managing Directors and Manager of Aragon (ADA), Olavarrieta said that the concentration process "was completed as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the deadline, which was not now established in the context of the business plans with Banco de España", he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million is a historically unparalleled process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, so that we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he said.
Olavarrieta stated that "there were a number of unfavourable opinions about the slowness of the process, the inserability and insanity" because "Banco de España encourages us to complete the deadline before the end of the year."
The Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday assured that Spain had one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "maybe" in the whole world and added that those who doubt this "without further knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic situation, we have to make "no worries" about the situation of financial institutions and savings funds that have undergone a "very important" concentration process that will be completed "as soon as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had very well maintained the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but at the same time conditions for the whole European Union.
The tensions on the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has introduced new adaptation measures, beginning with tax reductions for small and small enterprises, the regulation of time-consuming companies or the abolition of the 426 Euro support for unemployed persons, which do not involve unemployment, up to 49 per cent of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports, and 30 per cent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the Deputy Head of Government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former President Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis.
How can these events be understood?
It is assumed that the Merkel position is not an error in its public work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
Germany is taking up a fundamental new perspective for the design of our future, which coincides with the maintenance of the traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, there are three possible ways of speculating from the crisis in Germany.
The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south had to leave the euro area.
The second is that the re-introduction of the German Mark - although it now sounds more like Science Fiction - is supported by a majority of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a reorganisation of the euro in accordance with German proposals: more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; penalties for countries that exceed the deadlines; possibly the payment of some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adaptation measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been shown for some time. That is why there are no excuses now.
First of all in 2009, both the IMF and the European Commission made incentives for deficits and the German government took a constitutional reform from the arm to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of the inter-operation between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practice of its European partners, including France.
The second sign put the Central European country out as a sign that the decision to save Greece was painful.
At the time, this was strongly criticized, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were absolutely against a salvation of Greece.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel has come out again with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements to enable the rescue of a country and at the same time obliges private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was set up as an anti-European because it was the Irish crisis and all of the following.
But its proposal, even if something is wrong, has been adopted. In the coming months, we will be participating in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures to take place from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not think to exceed it.
It is clear to everyone that, even if unaccompanied measures must now be taken, the old way of functioning of the euro will no longer exist from that date.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new monetary area in which the opposing countries are severely penalised, forcing them to declare themselves unable to pay, and in this case the private sector must take part of the cost.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard growth course, with high savings and investment rates, consumption measurement, productivity improvement and competitiveness as well as positive external balances.
The other alternatives, based on debt and construction with huge gaps in the balance of payments, as pointed out by Spain in booming times, will simply not be taken.
The offer is clear.
And we would do bad things not to understand it.
It is not just about lowering the government deficit by three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst we could do under these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will go to more peace.
And that we will use the opportunities offered to us until spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has understood this too, and his dual announcement (the promised reforms after the discussion with the major companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis of creating order in his own house has been prepared.
But the red line drawn from Germany is there, and it doesn't seem that it would change something.
Among the options considered, we should not exclude the euro area that we had to leave with less serious countries.
In this case Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and regulation
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show the spirit of invention, but not the will to pass a punishment.
The alleged exclusion of two players from the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of November 23 against the Ajax in the Champions League resulted in a lot of ink being wasted on whether it was an unsportable act or not and whether both players should be punished by UEFA.
As is generally known, the two players lost a few minutes before playing (his team had already clearly won) time and played several fools to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next league game against the Auxer and thus enter the next game phase without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football.
It is so widely distributed that it is part of the Ethos - the unwritten, but in this type of sport - rules.
Part of the ongoing debate on the case is that a team of the football club Real Madrid (who presented in his Hymne Noble Mot and Honor and on other occasions had punished his players for similar events) played the main role, and on the dramatization by Maurinho, who added an episode to his long history as a theatrical and provocative engineer.
In any case, the debate focuses on whether these behaviours, which are not expressly prohibited by the statutes, are contrary to the principles of sport, that is to say whether these actions constitute a rule of conduct.
In this case, the damage caused by the sport spirit should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical insecurity of the opponents, an aspect that was not threatened by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the anti-trafficking players taking an unfair advantage of the counter-attack. Also, this did not happen.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally understand under false play or rule because the circumvention of the rule has not been carried out in secret in order to avoid a punishment, but it should be as reprehensible as possible to punish it by the judge.
The players waited and accepted the penalty gladly.
Another question is what kind of advantage the dealers from the intentional fools sought.
Here it should be emphasized that the rival was neither put into a less favorable position nor the benefits for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also no useful strategy for the next game, because the club then does not have this player.
The advantage is obviously that players start the next stage of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it's a long-term, to a certain extent unknown advantage, as the team could sometimes also exclude. Furthermore, players get a penalty in this way and go over in the second card cycle, in which they opt for a card with a card less than in the first cycle.
So it is not so clear whether it is really an advantage.
Finally, such actions are not against the sports spirit, which also includes strategic decisions to make the most of the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to deal with sanctions (that would actually be a clear case of circumvention), they wanted to choose rather when they submitted to them.
They made a strategic decision not to avoid a punishment or to flee from it.
Although the boundary between the gift of invention and the environment is blurred, I believe that this is a clear case of the gift of invention.
I have the impression that the polemic was created by two factors: because it was about two self-consuming conclusions and because of the nature of the provocative transmission of the rule.
The damage added to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
Offering to catch customers for group weekend evenings in Barcelona
This year's dictatorship allows a wave of reservations to fall on the 16th and 17th December.
The holidays paid by employees themselves are expanding. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners in the Christmas season that lead to Barcelona's restaurant and leisure supply of oxygen. But because of the economic crisis, they solve a price-offensive solution to capture the customer segment that represents the great mass: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, the companies and associations in question confirm.
In order to make accounting even more complicated, the calendar (silvester falls on a Friday) has let all orders fall into the week of December 13, with the result of a Lavine of dinner reservations on two peak days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have set up group dinners for budgetary reasons.
In order not to have to give up this tradition, many employees pay these out of their own pocket.
As is always the case, low prices are required, confirmed by the chairman of the Barcelona Hospital Board, Gaietà Farrás.
The representative of the roof association is not afraid to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think it's ten times before they book."
"They want to go out, but they look at the prices strongly," he stresses.
The business will go well with those who offer "quality at good prices with a good service", he adds, and calls on us to remember that customers are saving in times of crisis, so prices are asked at 25 euros the most.
In an investigation into various central restaurants, it turns out that the evening of December 17 brings the suppliers to collapse.
The group Soteras says that the requests for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would be booming. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
In another leading group, Andilana, which holds 16 guest houses in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has led the ownership of the calendar to scheduled reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to maintain the pre-annual prices with menus for each taste from 19,95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Group, which leads El Mussol, Attic, QuQ and a total of 23 locals, one does not lose optimism after the revenue has been re-flowered and good since the second quarter, even if the prospects for Christmas business are not met for a few days.
Sources of the group stress that the 18 will also be an overactive day with friends who celebrate Christmas.
A Christmas menu was added to the six group menus for 30 euros or more than price hot. You have the impression that customers are ready to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and want more details, such as Cava.
In some companies, green sprays are also seen, so the employees are invited back. This gives the impression that the groups are again in the process.
Fécasarm's top-level conference (with mergers such as the Barcelona Club, Restaurant and Leisure Association), the vice-chairman, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are quite "living", although the customers "exploit a maximum".
The fun at the celebration, however, did not go back, no matter who paid.
Pakistan's nuclear programme is of great concern in the United States
Islamabad represents nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
Discoveries of Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the US Department of State, revealed by the web portal Wikileaks, confirms the enormous concern of the Pakistan nuclear programme Washington.
On the edge of clear and gentle details that provide the documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries in matters of atomic security is not enhanced, but rather "abstains", and that the unstable Asian country produces more atomic weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country".
In particular, the very nature of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that the weapons are not put together, but their components are stored in order to make their destruction more difficult in a possible attack - Washington prepares sleepless nights.
The following risks include the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of the former Head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some atomic installations to the area attacked by the Taliban, the probable spread of nuclear material and the susceptibility of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people implicated in the nuclear power stations and missile programmes will be viewed not only by the United States but also by Russia as a far-reaching one and as a reason to be cautious.
"Pakistan must set up strictly religious personnel to monitor nuclear installations; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organisations have more opportunities to recruit people who work on nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a discussion with his North American colleagues.
New to the documentation revealed by Julian Assange's Internet Portal is that cooperation between the US and Pakistan is lagging behind in nuclear proliferation and the increased pace in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the message, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", states: "There is often no transparency; we do not receive answers on aid offers or they are rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, an official of the State Secret Service for South Asia, confirms that "in spite of the economic catastrophe of Pakistan, nuclear weapons are produced as quickly as any other country."
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington during a visit by the chief army leader, General Ashfaqkayani, to "clear the responsible", that "Pakistan's Army has its silent support of terrorist groups."
Hunting for Wikileaks Chief
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the fight against terrorism to prevent new discoveries.
Interpol gives a red warning for the persecution and invention of assanges.
Everything associated with Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth, in which the facts are only difficult to explain.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" for "suffering and persecution" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrangement for arrest.
Besides, it's not new, it's from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the last revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian must commit to Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures "the police knew where and how they could contact Mr. Assange."
Already on 20th, the International Police Office, based in Lyon, France, issued the order on Sweden's request, but it was not announced until yesterday after the Swedish authorities were given the authority.
This is the case. The 188 Interpol countries are instructed to identify and find assangs "to temporarily capture and deliver them."
Although Interpol cannot arrange for the arrest of a person affected by a red warning, many Member States consider the red alert as a free letter for arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral delivery agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to remain.
The action was initiated by Assange's lawyers, who publicly published a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by videoconference.
They also remember that Assange applied for an exit from Sweden and was compared with the state attorney Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the security chief of Stalin, who was granted the appropriate authorisation.
"It is like a hunt, not like a legal persecution," the letter complains.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia is appreciating the innocence of her son - Assange is standing in an unknown place, yet not sneezing.
On Monday he gave the head of the magazine Time per Skype from an unspecified place from an interview. During the conversation he requested the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proved that it was responsible for the organisation of North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violate international agreements signed by the United States, it had to retreat," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who called the application for resignation "laughing and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should put value on the opinion of a type with a website," he explained to the CNN sender.
Obama himself has commissioned a high level of responsibility for the fight against terrorism, Russell Travers, with the prevention of new document disclosures.
The attempt by President Barack Obama to pay less attention to Assange is contrary to the views expressed by conservative politicians and commentators in these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will be chaired by the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January, has requested the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "to seize their funds and any person who supports them or makes a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone further, and he had to withdraw his statement that Assange had to be "killed".
"Obama had to turn him into a target disc and use an unmanned aircraft or something."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Anyone who has been able to secure information in the government is guilty of treason and everything that is not directed is one too mild punishment," he explained to the sender Fox.
Puigcercós is looking for peace with an eyebrows to the Carod nearby in the ERC
The Republican leader shall allow the Party to vote in secret on its continued existence in the Office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercos seems to have found a recipe to leave the ERC undirected after the loss of 11 Members and half of the voters.
The Chairman is aware that his threat of withdrawal is not enough for the close followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. He also knows that the influence of this sector is as weak today as its mentor himself and he will not be protected by the same head fractures as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with an eyebrows, which would ensure his position until the next municipal elections.
For the first time yesterday, it was announced that over 200 regional members of the Council of the ERC could speak secretly about their stay in the office.
With election cards, not with a raised hand.
If the Carodists wanted to leave the president a criminal list, they could do it without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the chief wants to avoid both the impression of division and the impression of subordination among his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel half the votes plus one not confirmed, and he added without indicating percentages, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
Carod's colleagues are asking the president to provide more than the party's office, an insufficient gesture, as Puigcercos controls the top organ of the congress.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will be agreed with the Board on a plan of action from now until May.
They are expected to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic humorification, which will be submitted to the Council on 18th.
Their intention is to provide Puigcercós. In contrast, it is to promise to present to the Congress in the autumn of 2011, which already holds the party's views as a fact.
The Chairman of the ERC is of the opinion that the "polyphony" damages stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organisation to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the acting Councillor Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovací thought it was a fact that the chairman was "on exchange against different objectives".
He counted five of them in front of two.
First, the "restructuring" of the board to represent at least 90 per cent of the party members, that is to say the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the great novelty.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should finally give up the principle of assembly as a function.
In this way, he denounces a reform of the statutes, which will allow the congress to be held with elected delegates.
Since the end of the Full Assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team has already fought for the last two congresses as to how to occupy them.
In fact, at the 2008 meeting, the Joint Assembly was commissioned to conduct a review of the principle of assembly at a convention that should address the reform of the statutes.
This date is still in place, since the internal appeal of the last few years was not acceptable to this issue.
Now, without the critical sectors lying on the floor, the time could have come to address this issue again and to conclude it forever.
23 Murdered in November, 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO census, four cases were recorded in Mexico less than 2010.

In the village of San Francisco Acuautla of Ixtapaluca, the living body of a woman with gunshots was found in her neck.
On the woman's skin, tattoos of Santa Mute and chains were discovered with corresponding images.
In the last half of the month, the body of a man with at least three shots and a message signed by a criminal group was found in the municipality of Zinacantepec next to a vehicle.
Two days later, the bodies of two men whose heads were covered with tape were discovered and a message was found in the municipality of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.

Next to him, the police found a papa with a message.
China maintains its objectives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
The representative of China stated at COP16 that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and that it would maintain its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020.
China maintains its bid to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020, says Su Wei, the representative of that country at COP16.
In his first public performance at the 16th World Climate Summit of the United Nations (COP16), Su Wei assured his country that it would have made a huge effort to reduce carbon footprints and to transform its industry.
He reported that in the last four years, his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its objectives, but would work together with the international community on this issue.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change was divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all aspects, progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes the targets for the reduction of emissions of gases, he explained.
On the other hand, it pointed out that in China the authorities of the Federal States cooperated with those of the Central State and the Communities in order to achieve the energy saving objectives, effective use of energy and emissions reduction.
In addition, some multi-year plans have already been taken or completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those that received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme on the effective use of energy introduced in the last five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UNO), the government and private hands.
There is also a project at the provincial level for climate change, another for the exchange of traditional bulbs through energy savings and another for mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, a scientific government consultant on climate change in that country, confirmed that China's efforts would be much larger than usual.
He pointed out that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China amounted to six tonnes per person, while in the United States it was 100 tonnes. China is responsible for a nine per cent contribution to environmental pollution.
Also, there is unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by 20 per cent over the last five years and is expected to be further achieved by 2020, he explained.
Legal Exclusion of Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN explained that the former PAN Chairman had the right to turn to the National Committee of Rules and to ask for what he was entitled to.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former PAN chairman had the right to turn to the National Committee of Rules and to ask for what he was entitled to.
In an interview that took place prior to the appeal of Gabino Cué Monteagudos as Governor of the Federal State, he explained that Espino's exclusion was a decision that was taken at local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Sonora Committee of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr Espino has the right, in his case, to appeal to the Commission de Orden del Conseil Nacional to make a decision by a competent authority," he added.
On the other hand, he explained that it was not the time of 2012 and that an alliance with presidential candidates had never sat on the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Action Nacional came out of the internal vote on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor was elected.
"The (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not so far. It was a proposal for the Community choice, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN looked back on 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; on the contrary "we enjoy it and it strengthens us", he commented.
He said that the Council would no doubt choose the president or the best president, the Action Nacional for the next three years, so he handed over the letters "to those whom the Council would decide."
"I am completely unconcerned and open. I would be proud to transfer one of the five to the office of the chairman."
He predicted that the party's rise in the last elections of 4 July would be reflected in the next elections, although "it's not the time to think about 2012."
"Now it is up to the Governor Gabino Cué to support his mission."
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would wear flags and be observed throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and hopes are put in them and I am sure that Gabino is above the requirements."
When he was questioned about the criticism of the PR by President Felipe Calderón because of his record course in his four-year government, César Nava called on the PR to reflect on the six-year period of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should first defend them, they should finally come out of the closet," he confirmed.
He is of the opinion that the holder of the federal government's terms like those that he could make in his speech at the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there was no oral ban and even less a censorship.
Obama applies to Twitter for the law for undocumented students
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, then call your senators and insist on the adoption of this Act," the President of the United States tweeted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the country-wide mobilization to support the Dream Act - Laws on the Legalization of Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog in the social network Twitter.
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, then call your senators and insist on the adoption of this Act," Obama tweeted.
His brief statement contains a cyber link to a broader document that calls for the public to contact with its senators, as the vote of the law directly favoured.
"With your voice that we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he stresses.
The message was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for each law, except for the extension of tax reductions from Bush's time and the financing of the government.
Such a blockage, which was announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Regarding the blocking of the Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs said he trusted that if the tax issue was resolved, a timetable for the other projects could be set up.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement about it at any time and then we can plan the outcome of the rest," he said.
The president of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would apply for the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act, which could be agreed on the initiative to legalise undocumented students from Thursday in the Senate, would be more likely next week.
The version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize about 800 000 young people who emigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, while living in that country for the past five years and who were enrolled in a higher education institution or in the army.
But the prosecutors of the law need to adopt the initiative sixty votes, which is why they are referring to the votes of a Republican who is a full-fledged member. At the moment, the organisations of the advocates of this project are organising an intense influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, of whom the majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only a Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must have several Republicans on their side if other Democrats should decide to take the initiative back.
Among the most popular Republicans are Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they explained that they no longer supported it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had spoken out for the law, John McCain, has not yet determined his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the greatest obstacles.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust in the Language' was a walk where the participants made themselves strong for the story
"I understand that with the sex in the language, but... the finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was supposed to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lingua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish literature and used the subtitles of her question on this occasion (on another event the round table was dedicated to the sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "takes us in trouble", the Argentine writer slammed in front of the audience, which consisted mainly of young people who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round-table, moderated by Marisol Shultz, attended the Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celoro, and then marked the Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is on the lookout to learn what a "Wonde" is, and goes to a doctor from which she does not receive an answer, but guidance for the guide of her story.
The infectors leave her convinced: "Getitude is not my strength, perhaps it is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologists, who stole the breath in the middle of the walk, and who explained that Wonde was not a scientific concept, the psychoanalyst revealed the secret: "The wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main figure of the story makes it easier and concludes that she "only experienced from the wound that it is really open and does not exist". But she is convinced that the lust in language and its fall mixes.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a thrilling story he called 'Lob of invention', in which the finger is not mentioned in the wound, but is discovered.
He told of a famous magician who brought back the clouds, widely traveled men, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turning point and reported on America, the great novel that was not missing from its own chroniclers from the beginning, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticised the flood of the stories told by the emperors.
"Cervantes, who introduced all of us (the writers), mocked the prettier witnesses who appeared in the true stories, but otherwise the story of America would never be told - with the imagination that even the shame came."
However, he argues that "it is the crazy and lying who best imagine the things", and there reality and lies approach each other, where one no longer knows which side the story is, where fiction reaches the summit.
He actually calls it the Tradition Cervantes.
"We inherited from him, to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was on the row, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the FIL had contributed to the round table 'The Finger in the Wound'.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican woman dedicated her contribution to the great wounds of social violence affecting her country - as in Latin America - as a result of the fights against drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, unplanned commitment," she explained, after pointing out that literature is communication and commitment that builds between the author and readers as in a "chemical reaction".
In the evening, Spanish poet Luis García Montero decided, whose contribution also highlighted "this finger of the writer engaged in the wounds of the writer".
He noted that in a fast-lived world also the intellectual habits and control of consciousness run out on dogmatisms, and is forgotten, "that behind every confirmation there is a little no and behind every lie a little yes."
"In order to be possessed of our thoughts and reality, we need to be nuanced: And nuances often meant to put the finger in the wound and to disturb those who feel much better when they think in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in pre-made ideas without nuances, and also to harass the powers who prefer to share the world in black and white, he noticed and called for a sense of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, has experienced Up and Abs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the game, there are also two different styles, which are presented by their respective trainers, and the encounter marked by opposites reflects the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced Up and Abs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has been well behaved, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentinian has played with the medal for the second champion, he is a step back behind the winners and has surprisingly played consecutive finals with the same team.
The Santistian strategy reached the first final game as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the bullets in his hand, with which he suffered a major defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, when 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010' in which they were playing against Los Diablos, Rubén had to re-instate the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but at the elfmeter he came forward with 3-1 and got two possibilities to record his title, but finally three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned into a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore he does not want to be persecuted once again by the misfortune and free himself from the evil spell to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, that's for my affection, that's why the title will come to me, but what's going on before is the most important thing," said the controller when asked him about the lost endgames.
The last final game has remained strong in his memory, he assures us to have learned much from it: "The only lesson we can learn from it is that until the divorce court does not celebrate the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were prepared to separate, and I believe that this is a lesson until the game is over, there is no reason to celebrate."
To know that this series could be decided by Elfmeter shooting, it does not bother him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to get to Elfmeter shooting, you want to close in the regular game time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately the fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the intense effort to keep the title in the hands that leaves us something for this final game, and we hope that this time will not come."
It is in Romanso's power not to be just the second champion and to spend the first time bringing the title.
The USA changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Persons must submit themselves to visa applications at the consulate before their consultation with the services; costs will be reduced in time.
With effect from 10 January 2011, the procedures for the application of a visa in the messages of the United States and the consulates will change.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves before their consultation in the Consulate at the services for visa applications (ASC) starting letters in English.
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which shall be verified by the Consulate before the discussion.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of the settlement of the visa is reduced, as it is no longer necessary to pay separately the time-limits for the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is dealt with.
The applicant shall provide only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for Visa with request (including Visa for timers) and $390 for hands and investors.
Those who wish to extend their visas must not have a conversation in the consulate, they must only introduce themselves to the next ASC, where they will present their documents and fingerprints.
As biometric data are collected in the ASC, the applicants who need a second deadline for the conversation in the consulate will remain there less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo must no longer pay the service charge of 26 dollars.
For further information on the new visa application procedure, see the following website: http://mexico.usebassy.gov/bolettines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the founding of extraterrestrial life
The North American Space Agency hosted a press conference to present a fund tomorrow, which will have an impact on the search for living beings in all.
The National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The fund will be presented tomorrow at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts from astrology. It is a science that investigates the origin, development, distribution and the future of life in the universe.
At the opening of the press conference, NASA assured that it would present "a supervisory fund for the search for extraterrestrial life", triggering speculation in experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that in hostile environments that have so far been considered uninhabitable, human beings could exist. The hypothesis was suggested that these could transform into intelligent beings - like humans - if their living conditions improved.
Apparently it is a microbe that was found on the basis of the Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that was kept too toxic for all forms of life on Earth, because the lake is highly arsenic.
In any way, the microbe uses arsenic as a means of survival. Given this ability, there are increased chances that there may be a similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms change the arsenic, astrobiologists have shown that "there is actually another way of life, there is a second way of life that is different from what we know."
The space agencies will announce tomorrow, on Thursday, the actual scope of their fund at the press conference.
At the conference, geobiologists Pamela Conrad, who investigate the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (the largest moon Saturns) under the question of whether his chemical composition of the earth resembles it.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Pattern form an opposition block
With the reform of the organ law on the Congress, the two-party system will be introduced, they complain.
The 60th legislative period had just begun, and an opposition block had already been installed, led by the representatives of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalvo, who presented himself as an Independent. The four asked the following questions: the entry of the 'Two-party system' into the chamber.
Before the opening of the session in the 60th legislative period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and patron Montalvo opposed the reform of the organ law, as it would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeated, they would introduce a 'two-party system', because now there would be two people, the same number as the parties that controlled the congress.
These four MPs, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the presidency of the Panista Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo explained that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political position with these reforms.
He explained that in the next few days they would speak to PAN and PRI representatives to change the scheme. In doing so, they went out of their political will and if they did not have it, they would again be unjust from both parties, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
"To this end I come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we will be excluded from all decisions that do not even look back to taking into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergence explained that there were agreements with PRD, PT and pattern and that a pluralist group would therefore be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued that the Congress, after being monopolitic, should now be "duopolitic".
"It is not the spirit of the law reform that should govern an eternal two-party system at Congress."
"For the first time, this group begins with five Members and talks with other colleagues to make them more active," said the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT pointed out to PAN and PRI that the Congress had now turned into a 'bate' for two.
"Before it was just a party, now they're sharing it to the second."
Mr Montalvo asked to respect the Members and give them their place at the negotiating table.
"It must not be left outside because of the top five decisions that are likely to be nine Members. The five that are currently seen as being divided into different groups have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because because because of the reform that has been carried out and distributed by the others, we remain outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 peso more for "the supplier"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays a further check to the disputed owner of the company for electrical material.
Another check of more than 200 000 peso for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
This is the sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical material in the second half of the year 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the site for more transparency of the city administration, this cheque was issued to an amount of 200,144,56 Peso with number 9258447 in the last 16 November with the purpose of using "Cumulative accounts".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already sent more money from the community to this supplier. She is watched by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because she sells too high prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount you still owe and hence the number of checks that are still displayed in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought at her, it is just paid the debts, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "appeared" in the last quarter of the year "on": 24 September, two of October 15, October 19, October 29, and the last of November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as provided by law, when a company is questioned by the ASE in order to prevent other administrations from applying for their services, the treasurer assured that their services would not be reclaimed.
After the newspaper Noroeste published the inspection of the checks issued by the city administration to its suppliers on 25 July, it was announced that before, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year term of office of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 checks at Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also businesses with Jumapam where they took checks worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be improved urgently
Tourist companies regret the accident of foreign tourists due to the poor condition of the Gloriata Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
Following the storm of a foreign tourist in the collapse of the Glorieta Sánchez Tabooada, the tourist industry of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay particular attention to the areas in a bad state and to throw a bad image into the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Dealers of the Zona Dorada, recalled that there were many different opportunities to maintain the destination and to turn the bad conditions that tourists face into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the poor condition of the roads and roads had had a negative effect, as the tourists came to wander and saw the disorder, how they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"The politicians don't know what it means to have to close a company one day and they don't think about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't do the construction work in this way slowly and planlessly."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the storm of the tourist would have paid attention to the lack of prevention and the remaining maintenance work on the part of the city.
"The community must take over its responsibility and avoid what is going on again. How is it supposed to do this? Well, through a preventive maintenance instead of improving everything in the background," he explained.
"We look forward to having a clean city. Not only because it is a foreign transport area, it must be maintained, we also have a right to a clean living space. The city administration must change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unappreciated and incomplete," he said, "for example el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. It must be offered a good product, a city that cleans its beaches and streets, and the tourist attractions are constantly on fire," he added.
"These provisions have not been given enough attention and these kinds of incidents simply put what is obvious to all: maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Promoción Turistica, expressed how important it was to save the tourist places of Mazatlán because they would not be used properly and leave a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places that together with the city had to be brought to Vördermann. The city should be privileged to form clean, orderly and attractive for foreign transport.
" Luckily, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites, which first had to be cleaned and cleaned to make them attractive for foreign transport and to provide them with the inventory we buy for this destination.
IP Demands Congress Results
Mr Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, proposed that the Members should take on the great responsibility of providing a model for a better Sinaloa, which is facing many challenges.
The company sector of Mazatlán calls for a worthy Parliament, free of agreement with the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and is facing great problems.
Yesterday the 60th Parliament was dedicated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alliance, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergence and another of PVEM.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to feel obliged to the society and the various social groups, which are responsible for parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same pattern of partnership and paternism.
Mr Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Entrepreneurship Council, proposed that the new Members should take on the great responsibility of setting up a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that the Members will really exercise their right to act freely from agreements between the parties, because it is common for them to enter into agreements with which they represent their own interests, thus turning themselves into carnival compatriots of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should prove their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We are concerned that they do a credible work and are primarily engaged in the company and its groups, because they were the people of Sinaloa who spoke to them about their trust in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the major challenges facing 40 peoples is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in some way promote job creation."
With regard to the foreign transport sector, he called on the new Members to give the necessary position in the State budget to support the Ministry of Foreign Transport.
"I understand that it is the Ministry with the two most important funds, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
The tourist projects must be allocated funds, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been reintroduced in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
The Holy King Is Seeking
The children of the Coronado Valenzuela family are curious about dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys.
It will be difficult for parents to meet these wishes on the next Tuesday, because the budget is no longer composed of 12 people and a goat.
Yet Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toy and the clothes they so admire.
The family inhabits a modest house in the village of Salvador Allende. They live by hand in the mouth, because the father has no hard work.
"Sometimes hard times have been stated because my husband has no job. But we sell Mandarins and potatoes... I'm going to the street with the gorges in the afternoon," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo has been wanting to have a 'monster car' for some time and for this eight-month-old brother Jesús proposes Cayetana clothing in size for single-years.
" (José Alfredo) said to me, 'I would love this monster so much', but I replied to him, 'Let us wait, boy', because it was very expensive,' Cayetana recalled sadly.
For older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has the size of 12; the ten-year-old Isaiah has the size of 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel has the size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A couple in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King Is sought' by contributing a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 oral drugs arrested
In the context of the collapse of a cannabis production and sales network on Wednesday, the ten household surveys were conducted in the Austrian administrative region.
Fourteen persons have been arrested and various charges are being brought against.
The household investigations were performed in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where they were supposed to have served mainly the manufacture of drugs.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of Haschisch, cash and equipment that have served the production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson of the Quebec security police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom were considered the main drug addicts from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons are to be released in Sherbrooke for hours after their arrest before the court building.
Among other things, they could be accused of the production of cannabis, the possession of which is for sale, the plot and the service of crime.
These domestic investigations had resulted in a long-term detection activity that had been replaced for over a year.
"The information received from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests," explained Mr. Ruel.
About the 70 police officers of the regional intelligence unit Estries of the Security Police of Quebec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Office had participated in this police operation.
The secret migration could be easily monitored
The draft legislation of the Conservatives, which the Government intends to deal with the problem of ships charged with secret immigrants, will be seized in the light of all expectations, after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I am repressed against this charter."
"I am with a party that has put you on foot," explained Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus meeting in front of the assembly.
The Liberals claimed that the draft legislation, which allows each vessel identified as a carrier of illegal immigrants to retain for up to one year the Canadian law and freedom of movement, would be in violation of the Canadian law.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québecis, also indicated that he could not support the bill as he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will expect what the government is doing," said M. Duceppe.
The criticism of the immigration question by Olivia Chow, NDP, has shown the critics by hand, who demand that their party do not behave consistently enough against the secret immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and we are just trying to implement this by means of another bill, C-35," Chow said.
Therefore, we do not support the draft legislation of the conservatives because he is looking for the debt of refugees and keeps children trapped for at least a year," Chow explained.
Minister of Immigration Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the wishes of Canadians.
"The Canadians strongly urge the MPs not to tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal proceedings involving Canada and treating the country as a legislator."
"You expect Canada to take hard action," said Minister Kenneys.
"The government has not announced any confidence in its draft legislation which could have led the country to elections that had rejected the government.
A conservative, however, has voiced against the QMI agency, the government would call for a vote so that any opposition MPs would immediately make a statement against his electors.
The new unit does not find any unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new, standing unit for the fight against corruption and collapse by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public investigation committee on this issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
Since 1870, the metropolis has been holding a standing unit against corruption.
However, the announcement of Wednesday has more than one surprise.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed at the least on the occasion of the meeting of the Permanent Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutils.
It was also not missing that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Québec Party, qualified this announcement in public security as "a hot-skinned rabbit" and "a dish-based solution".
Minister Dutil had turned to those who feared that political power would have too much influence on the inquiring, future unity.
"You will see the result when we announce it," he agreed to confirm.
"You are aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public inquiry.
"The more Mr Charest insists on preventing the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only means to be able to form a committee of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political systems at the ENA (State University for the Training of High Administrative Officers).
In order to get out of this gas, he suggests that Quebec should have a special mandate to carry out investigations into the financial audit so that it can carry out investigations on corruption and secret agreements.
"You should be able to extend the inspection control mandate," he decided.
It is also of the opinion that the Quebec of the inspection control could extend the same power as the Commissioners, which you would allow to oblige the people to make a statement.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the government's sheets of Charest.
The Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the criminal law there in order to be better prepared for this kind of crime.
This request comes from the Supreme Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case in this kind of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed, on the other hand, that his colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain novelties relating to this dossier.
During the 2001 Operation Printtemps, which affected the gangs of the motorcycle police, 131 people were arrested, although the criminal law had not been renewed.
As a result, Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several rivers remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfalls that have taken place since Tuesday in some regions of the province.
In Shawinigan, in the Maurice administrative region, it came to an Earthquake on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were pre-emptively evacuated.
In the evening another earthquake occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the Lanaudière administrative region.
A road has fallen together.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, strong rainfalls ranged from 40 to 70 millilitres of rainfall in several regions.
Between 20 and 40 additional millimetres of precipitation were expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
In total, up to 100 millimeters of rain show had gone down here.
As the snow melt is still to be added to these precipitations, which has already been collected in certain sub-areas, the breach of several watercourses is feared.
On the Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service issued warnings about the high-water alarm concerning the Oueau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudier region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentian mountains and the Chene in Lotbinière will continue to be the object of high water monitoring.
In the Lanaudière region, the severe defeats of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon have followed.
In Saint-Calixte, a bridge was extended due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the breach of certain lakes caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Security Service continues to be in alert and is monitoring the situation as security adviser Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec Landeshochwater Centre issued warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular of Maskinongé, Assomption, Oueau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partly authorized
The Quebec Radio Moderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial relapse before the Canadian Supervisory Board for Radio Standards (CCNR) because of his controversial statements about social security and Haitians as well as his outstanding speech about Funk.
Although the CCNR represented the opinion, M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their own opinions, certain phrases had "inaccurate information about social security and unfairly negative representations of the Haitians as well as an unsolicited speech that is not appropriate for the daily broadcasts."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion on suicide involving the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide violates the codex of radio broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made during the broadcasts from 2008 and 2010.
The first available was submitted in response to a complaint from the "Front commune des persons assistees sociales du Québec".
The activist organisation complained that the amounts referred to in the consignment were inadequate.
The moderators should be more robust than misleading information.
As for the topic of suicide, Moderator Stéphane Dupont had represented the opinion that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had concluded that the message transmitted was that suicide should not be regarded as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the consequences of the "Dupont le midi" sending in question would have cut off a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was exposed with no table to his person.
The last point of dispute concerned the statements referring to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had been engaged in an effective media debate in this regard that a lot of reactions had arisen.
The CHOI moderator had explained not to have spent in favour of the Haiti aid, as one did not know for sure whether the needy would actually receive the money.
The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that these comments have not been abusive in character, but that their cumulative effect presents an unfair negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already abolished my three-day suspension penalty in this case."
"My file has been juvenile for half a year," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Board of Supervisors shall insist on the dissemination of an unresolved expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster has acted "in addition to its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, which, inter alia, had to communicate its decisions on a one-off basis during the main deadline within a three-day period, are minor.
King of the King-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montreal of Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, which shines in "Sanda" (full contact with King-Fu), kickboxes and Thaiboxes, now rises in search of new challenges to the Tatami and the world's boxing rings.
"I started 12 years ago in Algeria with fighting sports such as kung fu and kickboxes," Zemmal, who has been in the metropolis since 2008 to develop under the profession.
I personally look for the fight all-ruined, as for those who do not like the ground struggle, as the mixed arts present it, struggles in North America are rare."
Recently, his badge as a security officer, as well as his rivals at UPS, had given him bad news, in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the world championship held between October 23 and 30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won the victory in the categories of full contact with Kickbox and Thai Boxing," he explained.
"Now I'm preparing for the World Cup in San Shou in China."
"The fighters were invited from every category that had been placed in the last World Cup among the first four."
"My baby was picked up in Toronto Bronze in 2009."
"2005 I became behind in Vietnam."
"2007 I ended the tournament in China in fifth place, while I became third in 2009 in Toronto," he added.
"It is worth mentioning that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm, I will be the first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are the disciplines that come from China, where foot strokes and footpaths are allowed as well as ground drafts.
The twins usually play on a platform, less rare in a boxing ring.
The most renowned box fighter that has emerged from this kind of fighting sport is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, which is probably known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal had to keep only one event in his career, he would surely call his presence here at the "King of Sanda" Super Bowl of the King-Fu.
"This competition is the highest and most respected in China," explained the sympathetic pound core.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of the stadium Lumpinee (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"That was a great experience."
Zemmal had won his first battle in the semifinal of his category (80kg) before he lost in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real professional," he analysed.
"There are four mitts per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals meet each other in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer the stage to crown a single champion, the king of the King-Fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
In mutual agreement, Hydro-Quebec has approved the project planning companies $450 million of contracts for the water power project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the middle of this Lavine of more than 100 contracts, a consortium consisting of BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, to a sum of $295 million without a tender.
This consortium, called "Energie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a sponsor of the decision of Hydro-Quebec, the private sector's responsibility to answer this important hydroelectric project in the amount of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Energie gérance" awarded the lucid contract without any public invitation to tender.
For the Québécois party, the back-up of company consortia is a serious ethical problem that undermines the risk of distortion of competition and a price increase.
"This is a new way of playing a carded game and distorts competition."
"This means that you are now secretly carrying out games instead of carded games in an open way," yesterday, Sylvain Simard, PQ's deputy, explained at the press conference.
In the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, as it seems difficult for him to understand how the public interest can be handled in this way.
Minister of Resources Nathalie Normandeau had responded to this in the afternoon by placing very strongly in Abrede that this contract had been a card game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she said, as she strengthened the PQ's "unbelievably" and "suffered her hard".
She said "it's the least" that the PQ apologized.
The Consortium model is a global practice.
It is usually a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to combine their expertise in a bid for a complex project.
The Eastmain project shows a high level of complexity in terms of its scope.
The construction process is in progress and is scheduled to be set up by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without any competition being able to take place; negotiations had already taken place.
Moreover, the model of the consortium in Quebec itself is no longer an exception in relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the model applied in the field of engineering and consulting is the subject of government statements by the consortium.
A short stay of the Quebec Company Register allows you to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be permanent.
For example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any connection, and several of it, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As regards the consortium "Energie gérance", Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Bay of James is subject to special labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been paying special account since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the great employer of Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that the nose over the fact that the contract on project management has been approved after agreement.
"If you make an invitation and there are only a few applicants, your prices will be faster."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this March and tell you: you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea is, however, that the price is not crucial, but the understanding of the individuals," said Laporte.
This contract awarded to the consortium "Energie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts of more than 50,000 dollars received from the Québec Party.
The contracts were either approved by the Hydro-Quebec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After the review, the newspaper Le Devoir included more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts, companies or their branches, including in particular resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had entered into 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without including their participation in "Energie gérance".
All these treaties have been negotiated.
They total $449 783 344, including the contract with "Energie gérance" over $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had announced that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor) of the "Parti Liberal du Québec" were well known.
Minister Normandeau had made allegations that the PQ was equally linked to the companies that they "funded" before she stated that it was rather about their leadership.
Barometer Conscious of Consumers - The "green" label is not trusted
Greener, but unscrupulous skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main players of sustainable growth, but also little in the marked brands or eco-labels to control its choice.
Unfortunately, although it is in a media-efficient universe, where information for a responsible, informed consumer only fluctuates: the barometer-conscious consumer has a lack of credible information to complain about, an inadequacies that makes itself known as a brake of its commitment, as the first reading showed, which was held yesterday.
Although they have advanced the consumption of the so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, the Quebecers still seem to pay little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of Quebec's population, in fact, has little faith in the environmental commitment of companies as well as in the green company advertising, so the measuring instrument, which is set aside by the responsible consumer centre of Sherbrooke University, betrays.
Another finding is that half of consumers have doubts about the reliability of official certificates added to the allegedly fair products, but also about the credibility of products and brands that declare themselves to be environmentally conscious.
According to the same pattern, the speech of politicians on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
Information on responsible consumption seems to be important to stimulate this consumption segment, which is currently being experienced by about one third of Quebec's consumers.
In fact, empty and questionable characters of the information drowned the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer at the higher price of the products.
In addition, a third of Quebecer's stated performance of the green products and services that are being tried to put in their hands is disappointing.
According to another communication, over half of consumers in 2010 had changed their habits and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their convictions.
According to Barometer, they also preferred 61% of purchases in their city district and benefited from the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of environmental consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the homo consumption of Quebec likes to present itself as a king of recycling, who tries to reduce its traces left in the environment by taking care of animal protection.
However, the social and environmental consciousness seems to be stopping in front of his car, so the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have indicated, using public transport in 2010 or prefering the co-routes to demonstrate their environmental interest.
In addition, the introduction and cycling were supported by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which feed on the clichés.
State bonds for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, invited by Société Angus and the company Parallelle to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees with cooperation, but only in the form of a competitive loan.
The development company Angus and the company Parallele, who had hoped to receive a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture for the acquisition of the Daniel Langlois film complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint Laurent, to responsibly respond to his actual cinematic function, obviously did not receive what they requested.
The Government has accepted to be involved in this matter, however, on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec Government offers a loan of less than the initially expected amount that could provide an existing solution to favourable conditions in life, at least in the opinion of the sources taken from the public kitchen.
A first action plan, as well as a 12.8 million request, has already been rejected by Quebec in the last spring, and the request for a petition has been remedied summarily to the bottom.
A proposal, together with an action plan, has already been sent by the president of the Société de Development des Entreprises Culturalles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who runs the eXcentris.
A few days ago, he had her drop in a final case report.
However, the counter-proposal of the Cabinet was forwarded to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallels and Angus now have until 31 December time to respond to these.
In any case, the state spending premiums seem to have really been pushed aside.
Let us remember that the Quebec Ownership of the cinemas and cinema complex had relied on a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by providing the argument that the Minister of Culture had no financial aid for real estate projects there that he had not even allowed to come to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment complained of substantial, economic aid.
After the self-funded design of the cinema, film director Daniel Langlois had presented the author cinema with great difficulties in the space of his cinema complex for over ten years, which could justify the exception from the State Treasury.
The lack of cinema halls showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his clients at the stand.
The Société Angus and the company Parallele with Christian Yaccarini at the top, are directing a private-funded campaign, from which they expect a sum of $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one line wall has been running to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallelèle.
The goal of the future acquirer is to reopen the three cinema halls on February 27 next year with the presentation of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
But Christian Yaccarini has not called the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what he and his group hold from the proposals corrected below which they have been made.
The Secret of Complexly Slided Canada
The new American diplomats, which were distributed by WikiLeaks, fanned the secret of what the United Nations thought under the Canadians' inferiority complex against the Americans; but with the same blow, they opened the feeling of superiority over Canada.
As a result, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian electorate does not have the Canadian-American relations in mind when elected, and they believe that President Obama's visit would have helped the conservative government to implement its 2009 budget!
The four new messages between the American message in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly distributed yesterday, offer even more pique details than the only substantial content to be read.
A connection dating from September 22, 2008, i.e. during the period during which the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the extent to which the United Nations no longer participates in the policies discussed by its political leaders.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, who was employed in Ottawa, American ambassadors.
Mr Wilkins offers various possibilities for this situation.
"A Canadian near-inhabited minority complex may require the Canadian political leadership to talk much more about internal issues of everyday life than the United States assigns the black Peter to this election (as in 1988 in the campaign on free trade)," he describes.
The United Nations, as he concludes, is therefore "the literal Goliath of this choice: omnipresent but potentially too dangerous to speak of him".
The ambassador understands this "stupid silence" even less, since the two countries are in intense political and economic relations.
"Probably," he said, "it seemed to be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the elector has in mind as a key factor in the rush."
The other expression of this feeling of importance was the message sent by Terry Breese, a businessman in Ottawa on 22 January 2009, that President Barack Obama should prepare for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help to ensure that the Government continues to exist in the vote of confidence over the federal budget in early February, when Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, which has been created due to a living programme of 30 to 40 billion dollars," Breese explains.
Nowhere did he mention that the government had to attend Parliament's meeting before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from falling apart from the coalition and that the continued existence of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed implementation programme.
A further message, written from January 2008 and by Ambassador Wilkins, understands Washington's increasingly negative image that the CBC broadcasts dramatic series from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe little subtle performances on Maher Aar, the "No-Fly List" or also performances for the purpose of the CIA's muscle prosthetics.
Again, another communication reports in detail how Hillary Clinten asked his French official Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting if Europe was ready to take certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual 'fall to fall' decision.
At the end of the meeting, it was described as "he handed out a paper to the Secretary of State in Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to review the file again."
Finally, we note that the hosts are warming up with regard to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and very close consultant Stephen Harper, had explained about CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "introduced".
He referred here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global plan for the renewal of lighting
Yesterday in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to revitalize households, trade and industry in 100 countries to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas (FCKW), which corresponds to nearly one third of the additional reductions that need to be implemented in order to stabilise the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan adopts its position in the course of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of binding reduction obligations of industrial countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the FCKW given on earth by lighting would be avoided if the white-lighted beers, which so far still represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, would be replaced by fluorescent or better, by light diodes (LED).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the global fleet's exhaust gas.
Last year in Copenhagen, the major gas forwarders such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans, which were expected to reduce global FCKW emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, five more Gts had to be removed from this balance sheet in order to stabilise the rise in climate by 2 degrees Celsius from today to 2020 in order to prevent this out of control.
In the white glowing bear, 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact light bulbs, energy consumption decreases by 75%, with the new LED bulbs reducing this energy demand again around the double.
The compact light bulbs hold between 6000 and 10,000 hours on average.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those that the manufacturer Philips placed on the market this week - this company has also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-lighted bear, which conveys an impact on the savings of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that these completely new bulbs give only very little heat, they can also work with a rule resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact light bulbs have reserves, as they contain mercury and therefore need to be disposed of as a special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except for the producers providing an adoption site.
However, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, is not the compact light bulbs, but rather the coal plants that emit significantly more mercury to produce the electricity emitted by the white shining bears.
In the United States alone, these coal plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report presents in detail the gains that each country would generate through this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save a billion dollars annually when purchasing electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal plants, whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire is expected to announce the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon requested the publication of the results of the election of the President of the Côte d'Ivoire immediately after their deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to receive its work and announce the preliminary results without further delay," said a press speaker from the UN Chief.
"It requests all parties and institutions of the Côte d'Ivoire to demonstrate their responsibilities and to include each initiative until the publication of the provisional results."
Despite the pressure from certain foreign governments, the electoral commission had allowed the deadline, which was set on Wednesday, to be extended three days after the Sunday election, without publication of the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CEI on TV confirmed that the Commission would "go on with the work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday many calls from all over the world have been heard, but the CEI may finally call out the name of the winner of the second round of elections under the Laurent Gbagbo and his opponents Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo warehouse is counting on the cancellation of "misleading" voting fees in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the former rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the coup that failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Presidential Campaign of the Ivory Coast, had confirmed that the UN-practiced manoeuvre to frighten voters in the north of the country had scared the President's supporters of the election.
The entire election could be annulled if the appeals brought by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo counterparties are now more of the view that the country's highest court is not neutral, since it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically close associate with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the north who detracts from each connection to the former rebels, has assessed the delay in announcing the election results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far to call for victory.
Confirming his allies, Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results, since he knew that he had lost; and filed a complaint before the Constitutional Court after the election commission had been prevented from publishing the results, it was illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the unification and reconciliation process of a country, which was split into two parts over years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations had warned the policymakers of the Ivory Coast that they could be held responsible for any enlargements.
Laurent Gbagbo had enjoyed the first round of elections on 31 October with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, which was followed by the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France in the sense of the International Labour Office (IAA) in Metropolis is stable at 9.3% (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), so the provisional seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office of the Insee show.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is set at 2,631 million.
The figures for the second quarter refer to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% of the working population in the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate showed an increase of 0.1 percentage points.
In addition, 3.4 million employees of the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter, but wanted to find a job, including whether they were able or not to work every two weeks.
The situation of young people on the labour market has worsened by an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points per year) and 25% with the involvement of the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed.
The elderly have a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of over 50-year-olds, 6.6% including the overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 years could benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in metropolis (-0.1 percentage points over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
Following a dispute over its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office Insee no longer publishes monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
However, Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, continues in this method and announced on Tuesday a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
Against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a relief company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), an investigation procedure was initiated and he was sent to Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence during a investigation procedure on the public and suspicious markets in Luynes.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of undermining society's assets, misappropriation of general property, hehlerie, partnership in corruption, illegal occupation and possession of weapons, as his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is prepared to fight and is prepared to express himself on all the questions that will be asked to him by the State's attorney instead of spreading herringspinte."
"It is easy for him to submit a number of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them," lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agency France Presse) explained before hearing his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti Socialist) in the department, had put the judge in charge of bringing a memorandum to his jurisdiction before hearing him through his lawyers.
A member of Guérinis, Philippe Rapezi, was also accused and arrested on Wednesday.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her mandate had never done anything other than keep his deposit that he had to run.
As for the business competence area or destination of the related fund, he would never have known, as Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of the Aubagne Balling Area, was also charged on Wednesday for subjugation and complicity, but under the obligation to remain free under judicial supervision from the protagonists of these acts.
"My mandate was able to provide explanations of the facts that were presented to him."
"The chief prosecutor took into account that he was not to be robbed of his freedom," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were charged and released on Wednesday night from prison, including two of them under legal supervision, thus Deputy State Attorney Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy manager of the disposal company Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is prosecuted for "unallowed influence and passive interference".
Two state officials of the Aubagne Ballroom, Michèle Duval and Christophe Briguier, were also arrested, who was also arrested because of the title "Reduction and repudiation of General Goods by an officer of the Public Service", the other because of "methoduring of public money decline".
The life-long companion of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also charged with the "healing and subjugation of society's assets".
Among the people who were confronted by Guerini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently arrested for a similar case of fraud by the public who had affected Corsica.
The catchers suspect his company to have contributed to the "high" crime-related money laundering.
The investigation against X due to the need for fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the area of disposal, will be conducted in April 2009 by means of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigations.
From close sources, it is noted that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the grant and the operation of a deposit in La Ciotat, which is also waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities of the city of Marseille (MPM).
Afaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exceeds its central function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was held in Iran because of "spionage", the French public in spirit, moved diplomacy into alarmism and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
This is all under the attention of the United States diplomats.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and screened by the newspaper "Le Monde" give some of the reasons for this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained to the Americans its strategy, which went so far as to give these advice on dealing with their own crisis of "commitment" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They point out how the French officials have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of young French people does not qualify for the release of Majid Kakawand, a prisoner in France and US Justice, because of trade in materials for the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they set out the way in which the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making this idea credible, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, in a great light.
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomatic telegram, edited in Paris on 12 August 2009, bears the title "Iran: French comments on how to deal with hostages".
François Richier, Elysée-advisor in strategic issues, took part in the partnership of Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method to her.
They urged the Americans to put everything in order to withdraw their own nationals who would be held violent in Iran.
"Power noise," they said, "articulates loud and clear and without delay" the words "fundamental human rights", "freedom", "fast release" in the media.
This is necessary to bring the Iranian regime into disrepute, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this as much as you ask the Iranians not to do this."
Because "Stolen solves nothing", past the discussion attempts on infallible ways, the Iranians are "masters in exchangeovers".
Mr Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was a "practice of Iranian tactics": "accompaniment for political repression".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was due on 16 August, on the day she fled to the French Embassy) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 Euro bail).
And he let it be said that the Elysée is anticipating further hostages, a phenomenon that will "strengthen me".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens who live in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago, but remains in Iran.
An information was circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose delivery to Iran was requested by the United States due to illegal trafficking in sensitive electronic material, was released after a judge in Paris decided to leave the prison.
The American message is like many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence.
The release of Majid Khakawand is a bad news for Washington, who is pursuing the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of nuclear material.
Did France buy a cow shop?
The liberation of Iran from those of the French?
On 4 September, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, as he says, was not only "fully surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to deny it.
"There has been a real exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (now Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the ruling," he explains.
Mr Richier also wishes to point out that Majid Kakavand is still under "strict" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée consultant selects a telephone number, re-sends, so informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "now located in the buildings led by the Iranian Embassy in Paris".
During the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not appreciate his efforts to make by means of speech and by means of the media organized "flight trials", the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "significant" and "influenced middle role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dating from August 25, 2009, called "the media flash of the French authorities".
On what is so much "thank you" based with Mr Assad, the Paris Message is being asked.
"In spite of their declarations of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document thus deals with the reasons for the failure of the Elysée.
He analyzes the intensive communication efforts "to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria", he analyzes.
A 2008 policy was launched, which was "as early and undeserved by many critics in France and abroad".
"The Syrian role building up" tries Paris "to lead Syria in the face of what reward can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "seek peace between Syria and Iran".
The American message knows this from a good source.
On August 11th, François Richier confided to her: "Of course we don't know whether the Syrians have done anything at all."
"But we thank them all in spite of everything."
"This should at least create confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her in Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our countrymen".
No online games for young Koreans by midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called "the Aschenbrüdel", which will prohibit young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, as stated by government officials.
A bill that calls on online gambling operators to refuse access to these games under 16 years of age after midnight will be presented to Parliament in December, painted representatives of the Ministry of Culture and Family.
"Many children play these games all night and thus have difficulties with learning in school and also to lead a normal life throughout the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, with this draft of law, a trusted ministerial officer of the French Press Agency Agency France Presse.
The online games will then be available again from 6 a.m.
The companies had a long time to prepare for the application of the law, as he pointed out.
The government also insists on asking the manufacturers, which, on a daily basis, granted access to these games, to tear down those young people whose parents are asking for it, added the responsibility.
It will also provide free software to those who wish to provide it, allowing them to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and the newspapers report regularly from various, intensive Internet-related events.
The country is also an unrestrained champion in global online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games over 58 other nations.
World Championship 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the Country of Directors
In excitement due to corruption suspicion, the FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday marks the world championships’ educators countries 2018 and 2022, a highest political choice in which the range of influence and lobbying threaten to undermine the technical criteria in the background.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA's Royal Discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional Hochburg (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then become somewhat more exotic; the International Football Federation hopes to be able to win new territories (catar, Australia) after the premiere on the African continent in 2010 or to continue to pursue its descent in the United States or in Fernost (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Heads of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides the measure of the economic and political use of a world championship.
Thus, the skills behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
Otherwise, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish, Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which stood at the beginning of the revelations, with the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could also have ruined the chances for their own country, the leg of the football, which could only be the only one time the World Championship would austere, 1966.
The BBC had once again given the nutrition floor on Monday by broadcasting a documentary report, which took over three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to upset the FIFA and bring the English officials into complicity, who, in the first place, had engaged in intensive lobbying with David Cameron in these last weeks.
The Head of Government looks forward to a resurgence of Tony Blair's achievements, which in 2005 had achieved the organization of the 2012 Olympic Games for London.
Would this intensive use be sufficient to reassess the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less secure, because the Duo Spain-Portugal is not lacking in drums with its already finished stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, the Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the economic and financial shadow sides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the Solvency of Spain and Portugal increase the chances of Russia, which, despite its gaps in the Dossier (Stadien, Hotels, Transport), has become a major outside.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided that the inadvertent use of the press 'an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote' has been called upon by the committee members.
"You push her with shit, you try to compromise her," said Putin.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seemed to be the logical favorites.
First economic world power, seat of FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages for Japan and South Korea, which have separately developed a very beautiful project.
However, these new candidatures seem to be early for two countries that had co-organised the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the approval of the WM 2026 by FIFA for China, which would allow Asian opportunities to fall short of 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had brought all the registers with the expectation of futuristic stages, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the lack of television rights (due to the shift in time) that the FIFA is experiencing.
Second mandate: transparency
The Gaulle had really supported.
Morning had made him think he was a snitch.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than this one.
A mandate in Elysée calls the next one.
The current head of state will still be a candidate in 2012.
But the obviousness is not good at the side of the mystery attached to the Presidency function.
So you have to do as much as you can if the doubt exists.
In one, as in the other sense.
In 2006, the followers of Jacques Chiracs submitted that a third mandate was not excluded without believing in it themselves.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy assured to make his decision "sometimes in the autumn of 2011".
The fact that he would put the perspective of "two mandates" in Elysée in front of the UMP parliamentarians on the day of service had thus spread a little flexicurity.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
That's a big mistake.
The President only recalled that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year term of office to only two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentions the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You've been with me for seven and a half years, or at best," he explained to them in July 2009.
On a new one in May 2010: "Don't believe I don't think about the phase after that."
His words of yesterday no longer make him a candidate than in the morning; but not less.
If they make comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidate with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the introduction of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which is driven by Nicolas Sarkozy.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012 that many members of the PS are reminded of earlier than accepted for the fight.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer a candidature by François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46%) versus 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey.
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion with the UMP," the Prime Minister responded immediately and cautiously.
"If he were to find a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe in being able to win," corrects Alain Juppe, who has come to terms with openness.
Euro: the ECB is forced to retain its acquisition of state-owned documents
The last assembly of the ECB Central Bank's Central Bank last year should offer an opportunity to show how to emerge from the crisis, or at least to announce a large number of non-conventional monetary policy measures to be completed at the end of the year.
The European public debt crisis obliges the central bank in Frankfurt to make no doubt about the current, more tense situation on the European debt markets, in order not to cause them to deteriorate.
Political costs would be too high.
On the occasion of a press conference yesterday, the French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the active role taken by the ECB in resolving Europe's budgetary debt.
She did not dare to say whether she felt that the Central Bank could do more, for example by charging its program of purchases of State bonds.
"I keep my thoughts before my European trading partners (...)".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB in Brussels on the occasion of his consultation with the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, did not show much interest in his plans, but rather agreed to point out that the programme of purchases of state-owned papers on the secondary market would "be extended" and that we would "see how the decisions are made" at the Thursday meeting.
Only certainty: the ECB will retain its leadership at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the purchases of the Treasury Chamber from the ECB were doubled to some 1.35 billion euros last week.
And according to the indications of some traders, they were to have made new purchases yesterday on Irish and Portuguese state papers.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have purchased 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among the traders, the anticipation of a follow-up of the purchase course is never hesitated (see page 29).
The public authorities are no longer expecting any significant change in the rate.
If the lending transactions are already lost from the ECB's arsenal for more than three months, the latter will be made available in a free manner to the unlimited reserves of money, over a period of one week to three months.
The public authorities are already insisting that this measure will be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine that the ECB will change its programme in a substantial way."
" Otherwise, she would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," said Michael Schubert, the Commerzbank's public.
"A progressive rise in the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," says Norbert Brams, Volkswirt at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of their interventions on the public debt market, "the ECB had to maintain such a volume of purchase of bonds that is living on the market," Norbert Brams added.
In view of the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the euro area debt markets, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must come to any price to the sellers of the missing investors on the market and act in such a way as to prevent the early enthusiasm for the return paid to the weakest states," a significant bond holder testified yesterday.
For if interest rates were to be applied to altitude flight, the States would be even more prevented from reducing or stabilizing their debt.
This is the price for protecting the euro.
The Berlusconi government goes to Italy to cover
After a week’s worrying start for Italy yesterday, the situation was a little relaxed with the fall in the peaks of 10 years.
A return to the sad silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, Regional President Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "un quantifiable" and had to hear him with a "unpredictable" weekend, which the person concerned immediately demented.
In any case, on Tuesday, the stock exchange with the German interest rates had reached its 210 basis points record, and the prices of the contracts covering the competitive risk increased to 263 points, resulting in a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi pointed out to his Council of Ministers that the gap between Spain and the German interest rates is at 400 basis points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, however, had expressed itself as "severely concerned" with the "market turbulences" and a possible risk of ingestion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third national economy of the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, Volkswirt at Hudson Institute.
In Putuxt, that is, his problem is the absence of economic growth and the resulting, sudden tax revenue that endangers the State is no longer able to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012 is expected, although the budget for the Senate is estimated to be 1.3%, respectively.
Under these conditions, as calculated by the EU Commission, the budget deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (as opposed to 2.7%).
That is why the appeal for a new budget collection, which could be used after the holidays for a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new savings must be taken," says economic examiner Olli Rehn.
For an hour, Italy will receive the support of international institutions.
"The basic feasts of the Italian economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeating for a long time," assures Arigo Sadun, Italian trustees of the International Monetary Fund, which is entrusted to the IMF with Italy.
"At the moment, there are no problems, either in the short term or in the long term, as in spite of its high debt, Italy (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.) is required less stabilization progress than in other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD Chief of Staff.
The question remains about political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will be faced with an appeal from the Chamber of Deputies, which would allow the previous elections to be held at the end of March.
So there is a little time before a decision on a serious crisis is taken.
Europeans are thinking about the expansion of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde pointed out yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I believe it has been demonstrated both on Sunday afternoon and evening: Europeans are clearly united, ready and committed to defending their currency and their currency."
Although quite relative - yesterday's discount on the interest rates of European state bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, from the beginning of normalization, this cannot be the case.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that they could lower the debt mark of Portugal, which is probably the most effective target of the speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political credibility, especially on banking systems," said the opinion of Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, especially "political time is much slower than market".
The European countries, which are aware of both this scourge and the danger to which they are hiding, are intensifying the discussions to strengthen the already existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal consultations between the finance ministers directly concerned and in the further direction with their G20 counterparts are going well.
This is also true of Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan outlines the unconventional measures to strengthen the countries of the euro area at the crossroads of the markets (see below).
As regards the EU Stability Fund, its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, has already started his Asia tour on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors in Fernost about developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit is not expressive fundraising, he will certainly prepare the ground for this.
The first advertising expenditure from the EU Stability Fund is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative of the Agency of Reuters had entrusted the United States with a possible increase in the fund mobilised by the additional direct commitment of the IMF.
Portugal and Spain, first of all, are asking for structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisations.
Reforms to be brought to the rescue, however, should show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are on a different path than that of Greece and Ireland.
Both the one and the other are at every price to avoid having to ask for international support before they have put in place their own budgetary corrections and decided on essential structural reforms, which will bring them back to life.
The European capital donors are concerned about the options available in order to accelerate the process of normalising the markets of State bonds.
Axel Weber, who was on his trip to Paris on November 24th, had the first idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take it back into its own pocket.
The leaders of Barclays Capital, with regard to the European public debt market, decide that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity spray.
This means that the European financial stabilisation mechanism is currently at EUR 60 billion.
A council which has every chance to be examined carefully in the European capitals.
First of all, if the conditions of the market are met.
Snow and ice cream: 24 departments in Orange
The snow episodes are still causing traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary traffic networks of Brittany, and threatening to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now at the Orange alarm level due to the threatening risk of snow and glaciers.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments already in the Orange alarm level; 18 since midnight and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snowshoes stretch the north of the Gironde and the Charentes, it cuts slightly on the et Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snow cover is expected from 2 to 5 cm, i.e. from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfalls are considerable enough to cause traffic congestion and to affect certain economic activities, says Météo France.
In the region of Côtes d'Armor, several regional roads are blocked for heavy traffic of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the transport policyists who have stopped using their own vehicle only in the event of an emergency, and the use of some TER bus was deleted all day long.
In Picardie, school transport was cancelled for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were provided for in the Wednesday.
The prefecture "requires the drivers to take utmost care of the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) invited airlines to delete 25% of them on Thursday from Paris airport Roissy and 10% of Orly's starting flights due to the expected strong snowfalls.
The DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
The Gatwick airports in southern London and the airport in Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport economy on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it accounts for billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris to be built by Société du Grand Paris is to be recalled.
In order to lead the construction of the SGP into the way, the State has raised a capital allocation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would allow the SGP to give to the markets part of its financial sum twice.
Today it has finally come to the first calculations.
The 2010 supplementary budget, which is preceded this afternoon by the National Assembly Finance Commission, contains the measures provided for in order to raise the first part of these funds.
This is a two-way approach: the creation of a special tax on closure and higher taxation of offices in Ile-de France.
First of all, Article 15 of the draft law is deleted, "for the benefit of the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris".
This is stated: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
Secondly, a reorganization of the existing corporate tax: "to modernise it in order to increase its resulting product and to respond to this increase in Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
A puzzle.
This sum is not specified in the text.
From the 4 billion you're far away.
"It is carried out that the tax resources are to be added to the 4 billion euros of the capital allocation that the State will put in place and that the Société du Grand Paris will be carried out to and from the project," the explanatory statement is received.
The SGP does not find this system offensive.
"From the moment you book revenue (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the design over three years and then only create out of the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This is recorded in the budget and removed from the budget."
The SGP suggests that 2013 will begin to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, of which 4 billion promised can still be sought, is in danger of calling for a rather moving parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Explosive hacker and emsy spy
The WikiLeaks business has a double meaning.
On one side it has emerged as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is only a scandal in the sense of holiness that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level, and gives a foretaste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's move on to the line.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is to confirm the fact that every act created by a secret service (an x-like nation) consists exclusively of newspaper cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconis do nothing more than what you have been able to read over months, as well as in any x-loving journal (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the scariously characterized profile of Gaddafis has been offering Cabaret artists fabric for their sketches for a long time.
The rule that the secret files may consist only of already known news is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will realize that every work (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosenkreuzler) exactly repeats what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (but because he did not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism believe nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
So are the secret acts.
The informant is faul, and faul (or limited mind) is also the head of the secret service ( otherwise he could be anything else, for example, editor at Libération), who only considers what he recognizes as true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, who had sent the American message to the state desert in Rome, was the same as those who had already published the week before.
So why was such an abrogation made about the disclosures of these files?
On the one hand, they say what every formed person already knows, that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representation tasks, have turned into spy centres.
Any viewer of detection films knows this very well, and it does not happen out of a sanity that you do that to ignore this.
However, the fact that it is publicly repeated violates the task of holiness and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly: The idea that an x-fisted hacker can capture the secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a major blow against the prestige of the state desert.
In addition, the scandal brings less victims, rather than the "sharfers" in trouble.
But we dedicate ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened.
At the time of Orwell, all power could be combined like a big brother, who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have been completely correct since then, where you can control any movement thanks to the phone, any transaction done, the hotel visited, the selected motorway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if one looks at what is happening today, that even the secret encryptions of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the control stops to be unilaterally directed and is circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the citizens - can experience the secrets of power.
How, though, can a power no longer be able to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the character of Berlusconis or Merkels is essentially a secret free of secrets, since it rewards the public spheres; but in the style of WikiLeaks, it is offensive that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, meant to rob them of any power.
WikiLeaks has not done Sarkozy or Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this restriction, which has been added to such a violent power?
It is obvious that the states will no longer place any information reserved in the future online - this would be the same as an extension attached to the street corner.
But it is also obvious that it is to be expected to keep confidential reports on the phone confidential with current technologies.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state has moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could relations be maintained in the future and for some ears only?
I know very well that my prediction sounds after science fiction and romantic, but I see the need for me to introduce myself to the government agents to move in a secret way on uncontrollable marches, conveying their messages anywhere else than in the mere memory with them, and in addition to the few written information they have received in the shelter.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed sheets: basically the spying of Watergate had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology has progressed today like a cancer, that is, backward.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analoged) video cassettes enabled film researchers to identify a film band for bands by blowing all the secrets of the installation from the back and the front, while the (numeric) CDs today do nothing other than jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macroporations.
With the high speed trains you can travel from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this requires three and a half hours by plane.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication technology to return to cars and horses.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what was corrupted for secrets between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that require confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France beautifuls its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the implementation of the rapidly resolved financing promises (also referred to as "Fast Start" or "early funding") that have been implemented by developing countries.
And they've already discovered the ancient French beauty series.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to providing 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16, the EU drew up all the registers to convince its partners of the fact of its commitment to the fixed-start funding: a detailed progress report from its Member States, a press conference, a large follow-up, a brochure distribution.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and graded for its real value: the developing countries and civil society are happy to see if all developed countries do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces the release in 2010 of €2.2 billion, which brings it in the right direction to ensure its commitment to 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look into the detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional use has been put in place without prejudice to public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the direction that he considers best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen as a benchmark for those in 2009: international funding will be maintained and will contribute over 150 million in the framework of "Fast Start" funding over three years.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either with respect to the year or with regard to conditions at the level of public development aid.
In contrast, France considered that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no guidelines for expenditure in the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French support for developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease) - France proposes to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the disbursement of funds and loans.
There is no rule over it yet, and each one chooses its own accounting mode.
Some, such as France, find 1 borrowed € as equivalent to 1 spent €.
Obviously this is only difficult to resist: the effort is not comparable.
If it is possible to justify the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often projects linked to the emission reduction based on more efficient technology) it is sad to present the euro that is taken as equivalent to a given euro... In addition, only the costs of the loan for the capital country should be calculated as commitment (i.e. the equivalent of a interest rate).
However, France has nothing but the following considerations: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by borrowing 91.5% (389.8 million euros) and spending 8.5%) - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only country in the EU that borrows to a large extent.
Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (under others) to comply with their obligations 100% with donations.
In other words, if the majority of the European Union spends 1€ to fulfil its obligations, France will give just 10 cents and will understand a comparable use.
Nice hokuspocus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double swing: to part with a further development of the action over time and to the other part with the reality of the financial use.
France manages to believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" million in accordance with its promises and saves 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems likely that it was Bercy who conducted the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once EU internal (why do the other Member States continue to spend if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not completely deceived...
The chapter of the early financing is only a small question at a relatively short time compared to the whole of discussions on the climate.
But it could be too much of the drop in the incredible machinery of the UNFCCC.
We hope this will not be the case.
Whatever the case, it is imperative to learn his lesson from this first year of early funding.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its nature for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and equal justice with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could bring forward the discussions on the subject of long-term financing (a different, decisive and currently discussed subject): the question of "reliability" or the nature of its lending is not absent.
France could change its position to be as progressive as it is in other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the Environment Koscisko-Moriset, which will be held next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement about the fast-start of France and its vision of "reliability" and the use of loans would naturally raise from the international base of trust which is necessary for further discussions.
Alert - Children's Pesticide
A child of 10 years takes over the day 81 different chemical substances, as a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Generations Futures (formerly movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations) was published.
The association, which explains that its results "in view of the low number of samples analysed did not give any statistically significant value, but illustrated the nature of the problem dealt with", had usually bought a meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris, between July and September, within four, from a 10-year-old child to the meals consumed.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - have been investigated as well as seams of laboratories looking for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The counterbalance is low: 81 chemical substances, including 42 as possibly or probably cancer-like and five as safe cartilage classified, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disorder, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken substance, are not exceeded in the approximate whole of the cases, this survey is very well understood that the reality, in which the consumer may be exposed to carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine disruptive factors, is of great concern," the association noted.
Already during breakfast, the butter and the tea with milk already contain more than ten of the possibly carcinogenic residues and three safe as carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that may affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as an intermediate meal for the study, shows traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, which are included in the lunches in which the study has identified traces of an insecticide strictly prohibited in the EU.
In addition, the hacksteak, the tuna fish from the bay, even the baguette and the rubber of pesticides and other chemical substances were also chewed.
The analysis showed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
During dinner, the salmon steak with 34 determined chemical residues was the most 'rich', and even the plastic lighter used to warm the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The final risk of this "damaging cocktails" for consumers is "probably underestimated", says the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in civilization diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of 365 residues of different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
