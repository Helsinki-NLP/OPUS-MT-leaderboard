I didn't see that.
Tom and Mary were dirty.
They're playing behind the house.
I don't know why I'm still in trouble.
I'm not as powerful as I used to be.
Tom's dog bit a few blinds.
Don't forget Tom's blind.
Mary seemed to be infertile.
I don't want any dissipate for taste.
When Tom came home tonight, he found out there was no dinner left on him.
He knows them.
They must be very proud of their daughter.
Tom lost his way, and Mary gave up on the other side.
One left.
He started to explain what happened.
Tom has a stomach of lithium, he can eat almost anything.
Mother didn't know what to count on her son.
He knows the wine.
Tom felt someone's stabbing his shoulder.
Do you know who the parents are?
No words will express how wonderful you are.
I'd like a fruit juice.
Is he gonna sneeze tomorrow?
The clinical writings of Sumery were used in many languages in the Middle East.
I like summer, but I can't stand it.
Of course you do!
Mary loves you.
What do you want?
What does TATOEBA mean?
Where have you been all afternoon?
You found a nice guy.
He did it out of jealousy.
She washed her dirty hands before eating.
I didn't talk to anyone about it.
Don't get too used to it.
I'm thinking about taking a few days off.
Tom never speaks French to me.
Tom left it on the table very clean.
It's not over a beer glass all day.
She doesn't know any of us.
I've been happy with my work so far.
Do you really need help?
Being you, I'll ask him.
Leave them for us.
Here's a map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to the meeting even when they invited me.
Are you still here?
I thought you were going with Tom.
I have to go to the next station.
That dream was a mystery to me.
You must have paid a lot for him.
Tom's obviously lying.
Just like that and then the transport and then?
I need you tomorrow.
Why don't I have any food in the fridge?
It was just an accident.
I'll have to call you back.
Tom says he'd like to win.
Tom's gonna be thirteen in the afternoon.
Cut the meat on thin plates.
I can't watch her ruin her life.
Do everything with discretion.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
Yes, you do.
We went to the top of Mount Fuji.
Me and my wife want to go to Boston with you.
Remember what she was like?
I'm very close to that trap.
Playing a faggot is not easy.
She took the job just to please her husband.
Moscow is the capital of Russia.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom was worried about the subject.
We're having a lot of beer.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it to Tom.
You shouldn't be acting selfish.
The old habits are being measured quickly today.
Tom still has a lot of work to do.
You better get out of here right now.
Tom's helpless.
I like reading.
We cut the wire.
I just came to apologize.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
The train had to stop because there was a fallen tree on its wheels.
What did Tom shout at the crowd?
He's an ideal husband to me.
She's not as beautiful as her older sister.
I brought you lunch today.
We're going to parties in costumes from the seventeenth century.
Are you satisfied with your body?
Can I talk to Tom?
I used to admire Tom.
With great effort, he went out to the tree.
The translation of the Czech text is very difficult.
Tom's probably the only one who knows the truth.
Tom was standing, too.
We already know that, Tom.
I'm glad you warned me.
I'm out of breakfast.
You lied to me.
It's a beautiful language.
I'm not going home for a week.
Who sent you there?
We complained to the manager about the noise in the next room.
You're a kind person.
Can you ask Mary to ask Alice?
His skills qualify him for this job.
There's a drop in the shells.
She was alone in the dark.
Tom didn't dare tell Mary the truth.
Open your eyes.
I know Tom's wife.
Do you have a pen?
They're not helping.
I like that tie.
We didn't behave as well as we'd like.
Please close the door when you leave.
I'll be back tonight.
Did you have a fight with Joan?
You don't owe me anything.
You scared me.
The girls I met today were students.
The sky is covered by black darkness.
I need more than you.
You bought a car.
I'm afraid I'll stay here forever.
Tom gave you a bunny.
What should I do in this situation?
Are you driving to school by train?
Tom won't be in school today.
I'm mad at Tom.
Who's Tom going to visit?
That's what Tom can do, not Mary.
What if you invited me to a glass?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I can't answer that question.
I don't know for sure what Tom bought.
There's another question.
It won't surprise me when it happens.
He's free.
These people don't normally say that.
Ask your mother.
Tom was careful to wash his feet.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
Jana was happy as a bloke when she got the recording contract.
I wish you'd come with us.
She spends a lot of time with her computer.
We wouldn't be in this mess if you helped us.
I don't know what to do anymore.
He'll visit his uncle.
They're all out.
Tom couldn't hear it, but Mary did.
I can give you an autograph if you want.
I saw him three years ago.
How could anyone live in such a place?
It's been two days.
I know exactly what's going on.
Have you ever sang in French?
I'm used to this cold weather.
The Americans surprised the Germans.
There's not enough chairs in the conference room.
Tom hasn't had a good time.
I told Tom he was a fake friend and he got hurt.
Peru laundry.
This bridge was a paid bridge.
He was staring at her.
I came to school late this morning.
I took part in the search.
I went straight to bed.
We shot the lawn at the river.
Tom never drank hard alcohol.
Tom doesn't like working.
My heart is French, but my ass is international.
If you have a problem, I want to know which one.
Tom fell for Mary's hand.
I'm completely happy myself.
You did what you had to do.
We need to understand that we're still learning.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
Tom played with Mary tennis yesterday.
What's your dad's name?
They were standing here half a fucking wall.
I spoke to him in English and found out I could make a deal.
Tom had to run.
I see the book.
Has anyone ever talked to Tom with you?
You should apologize.
The plot is freshly spun.
She knows who you are.
I want you to see her.
Well, you'll regret it.
You've been silenced.
We should win.
All answers must be written in accordance with the instructions.
Answer my questions.
Everyone would be happy if Tom left and didn't come back.
Did you bring the book?
I don't dare open my mouth.
Their father is Czech and their mother comes from Hungary.
I'm thinking about getting divorced with her.
I bought a bag.
Do you know where your father comes from?
What are you?
Did you do that?
There was absolutely no doubt.
This letter is personal, I don't want anyone else to read it.
If I know, he's not married.
I can't say anything wrong about Tom.
Get up there and you'll see it better.
He's old enough to be on his own feet.
Once we saw what Tom's got on us, we got to catch a laugh.
Tom's wrong, right?
It's better to be dead than to live red.
They agreed to postpone the wedding.
If I were you, I'd go home.
It would be great if you did it for me.
Tom knows what he's trying to say.
The wedding took place last week.
I'm still eating.
The horse's kicking.
I loaned Tom a butt.
I'm bored.
I write my vow.
I'm no longer such a bat.
You won't believe what Tom just told me.
Mary doesn't have anyone to talk to, but she doesn't feel lonely.
If it doesn't rain tomorrow, we'll go to the tower.
Try and talk to the police.
You like elephants.
I don't want to change anything.
Barman, I'll get something to drink.
Do you like strawberries?
She was bigger.
I assume he's gone home.
I was in the woods.
Tom got drunk.
He asked me to wait there before he came back.
I made a terrible decision.
I'd rather go back inside.
She doesn't have to.
I know she's pretty.
I'm not going to school on Sunday.
He's got his own house.
I don't usually do it tonight.
Why do you want me to ask them for help if we can handle this on our own?
I was waiting for them to tell the truth.
Put it under the corner.
I'm so glad you're here.
She's out.
Tom didn't want to lose Mary.
Tom's home.
Throw that balloon to Tom.
I'm insulting her.
Was the police involved?
We like kids.
I wish I were a better man.
You're stealing, huh?
Tom has to attend.
You should talk to your lawyer first.
You're a good journalist.
That's what Tom's used to.
I love this book.
Waste is stuck again.
When I came home from work, I found out that someone stole our apartment.
Read the book.
This was a bakery.
My father runs a restaurant.
You're really boring.
I like him.
This works.
Don't laugh.
I'd like to make more money.
I know you're still not happy.
Can the message be true?
Easy on, easy on. Easy on.
Do you remember seeing me before?
I want to help, but I'm busy right now.
Don't be her help, I'd never pass the test.
You wouldn't be happier if I told you.
Can you translate from French to English?
A lot of people were waiting for him.

The first jump got wrong.
Well, let's have lunch.
We should give him a gift.

According to Tatoeby's guidelines, members are recommended to add only sentences in their native language or translate them from a language they understand into their native language. The reason is that it is much easier to make sentences in their native language in a natural way.
