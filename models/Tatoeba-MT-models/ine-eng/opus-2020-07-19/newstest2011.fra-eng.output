What's going to happen? CSSD knew neither Voldemort nor pastry in Prague.
The new CSSD elected to the capital's home will appear to have to overcome a real language barrier to understand itself at the municipal council level with their former and new ODS colleagues.
The daily Actualne.cz "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, i.e. whether they know the argument that was born in the last years of the marriage, when they were the partners of the current coalition leading to Prague.
The vocabulary coded that Prague's political crème set in motion during the previous century of Major Pavel Bem described some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new voters do not understand well the known terms.
At least they say it.
"Who's Valdemort."
"I really don't know."
"I am a young man in the Prague politics who responded to Lukas Kaucky, the choice of culture to test the vocabulary of the "parrain".
And with regard to the political veteran, elected Karel Brezina reacted the same way.
For example, the meaning of the golf hole.
"It's the only expression you offer me to use"
Otherwise, I don't use the argument.
From the vocabulary, whose daily Aktualne.cz published the words in June of this year before the pre-sectoral Congress of the ODS, the editor chose 6 examples, in priority those associated with the Prague Mayor.
Socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", go to the pastry, "boeuf nerve", "trahison of the capital" and "tolerate".
Three of the electors agreed for the Quiz, the fourth - Antonin Weinert, who has to lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then did not decode the phone.
The fifth election Petr Dolinek firmly refused the test.
"I don't care about all this and how the representatives of civil democracy get involved: I won't give my opinion."
"I am currently concerned about how we will understand our programmes," he said.
As we have already heard, Elu Lukas Kaucky would not appear to recognize in the legend above, that this is the influence of Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of ex-Mother Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky and the only expression he has become in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel," Kaucky says and immediately adds, "But I know the papers."
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course," he said.
Not only the Matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the environmental elite, know that the golf hole is Blanko's tunnel.
The two Social Democrats know who is actually Voldemort and Lukas Plachy know the place where to find the character - he thinks of going to the pastry.
"This is, I think, going to a company," Plachy is ready to assume that it is the headquarters of Janousek's companies.
On the same point, Brezina recalls that he takes his knowledge out of the papers rather than from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the candidates for the tests, there is no lexical argument in social democracy.
"I took advice with colleagues and it turns out that we really didn't have anything like this."
"The names are sometimes used for abbreviations and symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, president of the Socialist Party, as members of the Party call Hulda.
"They called me Briza at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that, along with Karel Brezina about nicknames.
Actuel.cz daily tested the name and it works.
Elu Weinert is Papy for members of the Party or even the least friendly Little old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the election by the Scrobes during the party's sponsorship, is named "the little game".
Surnames are also the only ones that allow to use social-democratics inside the party.
It seems that Hulinsky doesn't like to hear Hulda very much, but the daily Akutel.cz has registered another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor in Matrix Law" he recalls it appears that Petr Hulinsky obtained his title as a doctor in JUDr law at the bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "sorceres", published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women who are reported to be sorceress have common traits.
They are part of the old generation, for example, they cannot work for health reasons, they are free and they have no children.
The one that becomes "sorcer" is isolated to not threaten the rest of the village.
"Man rarely has this destiny."
"We no longer judge young women in good health because they participate in work and receive children," says a sister in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special institution of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He edited a brochure that should help to limit the hunting of the oars.
The case includes a "here."
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso don't know how to read," said the daily Die Standard about the disadvantage of written education.
The case of sorceress is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbor to Burkina Faso, Amy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman, died after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with the oil they had sprinkled on her.
It's the BBC server who sent this information.
The criminals claim it was the wrong eye.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual onions burned into the contact of the woman.
The oil flashed, it seemed, when the team wanted to "feel the bad spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of the "sorceres" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying: "The human spirit eaters have always been a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso is trying to reduce the hunt to the sorceries, Gambia no later than last year even saw the President take part in it.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, has launched a wide hunt for the witches who, apparently, would have participated in his death and would have been forced by the black magic to kill the President as well."
"From the bells of Guinea near the rescue, they brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of policemen and the personal guard of the President, men and women selected at random from the villages of Gambia," said the organization "Amnesty International in a message.
On the farm, prisoners had to drink a plant-based potion of hallucinogenic effects that added to other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners didn't survive.
On international pressure, there are about a thousand people who have been released.
Bakal's tenant: The chickens are heating, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing old man came out from the client centre of the RPG Byty company of the "carbon baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments to rent in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a file with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his son, his daughter, and his son, who is in need of a sentence.
The deregulation has increased the rent to these three persons.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to settle from next year for a second category 2+1 apartment 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and heating works on solid fuel," shows the finger on the new contract of his son the man who has the power to sign.
"But I signed it anyway" explains he for reasons of anger and half-resign.
The Citizen Association of BytyOKD.cz apartments, which described the new conditions of rental as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published to explain the method to be followed to claim.
But man reacts to it by a gesture of his hand.
"One said that, the other said the other said the other" by blocking the sparks.
The Ostrava region becomes the deregulation laboratory.
After New Year, this is what most of the apartments in the Czech Republic do not meet the market price.
Aktualne.cz has therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The RPG waiting room in Havirovska Street is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 09 a.m.
Right next to the door is a guard of a security company with a device to call the customers.
A special button, "loyer 2011", is lit on the touch screen.
A single pressure and paper with a number out of the device.
You don't have time to read your "157" number that your number is beginning to light up on the large screen under the roof of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second it's your turn.
After a short moment, an old couple comes to learn about the rent, but the new rents don't seem to concern people in the waiting room.
Most people have come to resolve common problems, such as demand for repairs, insurance events and others.
In the Ostrava region, the people of more than 44,000 RPG portfolio apartments have been receiving mail with the new dance contracts in their mailbox since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them an increase of 15 to 38 percent.
the special feature for new rentals has been open to the public since 18 November.
"It's been working for almost a week, so it's still trying" answers, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the geek when the client presents himself as a journalist.
The deragulation and former private apartments of Bakal are a very sensitive local subject.
The Vice-President of Parliament and the originator of the Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek region of the Socialists has made this a fairly sustained statement before the elections and is now filling the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new planner."
"They didn't even change me a whore in the toilets, eased in the introduction of the man mentioned.
However, above all, employees believe that retirements that come to ensure that they will receive a return on the new rental price if they sign as RPG has now promised in a special offer.
It is a return of half of the rent that the other tenants will receive who will have signed their new contract before 15 December.
But the "deregulation" of the Havirovaska Street is not really tied up by the questions.
"The 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for the rent," the employee said.
And yet RPG peeks both on its website and in the windows of individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If the two parties do not agree on the rent, it is an independent court that will take the decision.
'It is not a threat but only to inform about the unique and legitimate way in which to act legally', says RPG on its website.
"No one will be in court here" thinks one of the employees of RPG Byty and the man in the street in front of the client centre gives him reason.
"I have 13000 pension crowns and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he said.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media demands that no one sign and therefore the people wait," she said.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"In addition, the current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the resident portfolio of RPG Byty, who is just the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in rent.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010, RPG was able to invest with tenants in 4 billion apartments, in four years from 2011 to 2014, this should be 5.2 billion.
The large screen on the ceiling in front of the refurbished faeces of the Havirovka Street waiting room, however, repeats some of the information indicated in red.
'The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 per cent and does not apply to less than 31200 apartments or more than 90 per cent of RPG apartments."
"And this will always be up to 7.50 kroner m2 per month," says the screen.
The 38 percent increase concerns only 400 RPG portfolio apartments.
"In these cases, this is an increase of a very low sum of 19.66 Czech crowns to m2," adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2,600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase of 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in rents (cf. the graph) is given to apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the increase in rent have priority.
The mother's school is part of, too, offices included architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint de Brno is the new headquarters of Arch. Design.
No one could have expected that he would also open a mini-school with everything he needed - color walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a mini-game field on the terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch. design employees can go there.
Arch. Design. The company of architectural projects whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its mini-maternal business school since the first brewery of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially when it comes to children, and it is important for women architects and project managers to be able to return to work quickly.
At the same time as low-time employment contracts, the maternity school is a bonus offered to its employees by Arch. Design. within the framework of its social program.
Constructors and architects thus have the opportunity to take care of children.
They are the employees of Arch.Design.they themselves who imagined this maternal school and with the support of the management they were able to obtain an allocation from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini-school is funded by the European Social Fund through the operational programme of human resources and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to funding (up to 2.8 billion Czech crowns), they were able to buy equipment and equipment, and after two years to provide qualified staff as well as the road.
After the use of funding (two years) Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to make the elementary school operate on its own funds.
The project's preparation lasted a year and it's the Economy rating company that helped make the application.
Childcare is provided by a qualified staff, a nurse and a nurse take care of children all day. Children can go to maternity school without age limitations but they have more than three insomnia most.
Since it is a "mini maternal school", there may be only 5 children present at the same time, but there is more to it during the day.
The functioning of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use this school regardless of the hierarchy position.
Although it is an individual care and education, the school's mini-school program is comparable to that for pre-school education.
Children do nothing but play, but a quality education is also assured - from the beginning to the preparation of schools to English.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their child and do not have the stress of a delay in looking for children in a school away from their parents' place of work.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that there is a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus registered among companies that offer a choice bonus for recruiting new employees and who are friendly to the family and through this program enhances the marketing of HRs.
The house in oscen still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look inside of Gaudi.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric saurien, the ladder to a spine of dinosaurs and the balconies to open fish shells.
This is the house Casa Battlo in Barcelona of architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic forms, the house received from the premises the nickname of Maison en os.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, pieces of tiles and mosaics, façade recalling stairs and everywhere present curves, this is all that is typical of the New Art of Antoni Gaudi.
The front facade of the house runs its dream lines, its beautiful colors and textures that remind nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation, the geometry, the rhythm and the order were precisely considered.
In the night the façade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of color brightness is reinforced.
The rolling and twisting of shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood in vain copies the window frames, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the eyelids and the blades.
The house Battlo, which stands in the Eixample district in the shopping street Passeig de Gracia at the number. 43, was born from the construction of a house of 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first insisted on demolishing the old construction and construction of another new but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and better market reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-dwelling house was not thought of by Gaudi alone.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is just on its project that the decorations for an apartment representing the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade were born.
Other artists and creators also worked for the façade.
The joint work for Casa Battlo's plans began with successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and the Guell Park in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The premises renamed the hot house just after its completion due to its organic forms "the House in Os. "
Others, given the specific opening mechanism of the windows, called it "the house that dances".
It is said that above the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint Georges the patron of Catalonia.
Other elements of the sculpture of the building contain hidden religious motives.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with air events and typical fireplaces.
Their 45-degree slope seems strange.
During the creation of Gaudi did not comply with the construction directives at that time and did not be allowed to interfere with them.
At the beginning of the construction, he obtained permission from the city to build, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years after the completion the municipal council was terrified and asked for changes.
He did not like, for example, the members of the municipal council that the pillars of the construction lay on the public sidewalk.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the city's appeal, Josep Battlo asked (and was satisfied) for permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and on the third room and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The whole six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which you can access to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi is also working on the modern concept of space linkage.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the halls and the high society can communicate comfortably or be limited to private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi has also received new façades a non-traditional roof and two additional floors.
Gaudi's game with light is also impressive, blue and white glass tiles with which the inner court is decorated and with the light wells.
The two-colour game gives a maximum light in all the floors of the house.
It was just enough to bet on the principle that white reflects more than the shadow that, on the other hand, absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house that was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and most beautiful apartment available to the public.
Owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued their visits because they found it to be a profitable business and extended the scope of visits to the common spaces and to the granary including the roof terraces.
The ticket to the monument is not really cheap and costs EUR 16.50; students, pensioners, groups and card holders have 20 percent discounts.
The amount is still above the entry price in the other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic tours, you must quickly find a friend among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a mattress: women have other criteria than men.
Not an ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for the bed, so matellas and the floor provide a real basis for a good bed.
Of course, they must complement harmoniously to please a specific user.
During choice, several things are decisive: weight, size, age, health status and the owner's sex.
The type of interior in which the mattress is to be placed and the floor is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the countryside house where latex mattresses are not constantly falling asleep, they are not suitable because they are "heating" gently.
They have, above all, a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilating channels in the heart and if they remain on a solid board, they retain moisture. Of the harvest can also be formed.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
The one who spends the time abroad, where very thick mattresses are often used with a slender layer, will hardly feel well on a low and hard surface.
"That's how all the hockeyists who come back from NHL complain they can't sleep there."
"For their tired shoulders, their feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a smearing layer of moustache."
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that thus misapplies the "information" of joints and skin," explains Silva Adamczykova, who specializes in the refurbished furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattresses with the paresian mouse conquered the hockeyists as well as other customers.
"Today everything goes well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have suitable mattresses.
You don't need to be a NHL guy to be able to appreciate a hairy mouse.
That "miracle" just works.
It optimizes its stiffness and shape according to the absorbed heat or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing pressures you and you won't come back at night like after a hard match.
You just sleep better.
The mousse also works as a protection against the squares.
For the choice of the mattress depending on your size, add the length of the feet, or about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size of 180cm need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each bed in two places should be 90 cm or in all 180 cm.
For single beds, for example, singles are recommended to take at least 120 to 140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visit.
'However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should put your hands comfortably with the slightly folded codes. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Matheliers and Decorators who has been devoted for several years to the problem of a healthy sleep and the ergonomics of the furniture and teaching it in specialized schools.
For a bed in two places each needs its own floor and mattresses, so pay attention, however, to carefully choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will only remain on the floor at different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
Moss mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the spring mattresses of at least 15 cm, which counts for the shape and air layer of at least three centimeters.
"To touch or sit on the mattress you must not feel the springs," says Hélèna Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-defined guy to sleep.
The bed-bed, when the mattresses and the bed are united as Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms to sleep.
The mattresses were very bad; we don't have to wash it, what's really going on today.
And since during the night you normally sweat from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to remember a large (and bouched) tamis.
For this reason, specialists refuse to make a 25-year life claim for a mattress or life insurance.
But everything's fine.
And for this, an experience board on the part of the sellers: for a 120/140cm mattress, give up, for the coating of the mattress, to the hygiene or washing but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even though it's common to make clothes with a zipper closure for the whole, that's to say after the opening we have two parts (for washing and washing machine size is very important!) otherwise the handling for large models (and for one person) becomes when they are removed from a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a hard plank in your bed instead of a bed?
Never!
Maximum for one bed for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if no) with air holes and use the spring mats with a minimum height of 15cm with bags (from Germany Taschenfederken) and an air layer.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of such a bed.
For single-position blades with 14/18 blades, latex mattresses or so called sandwiches (maybe the combination of latex and coconut nuts), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more blades, 28 and above, where the blades are duplicated in the bottom of the kidneys and so it is possible to regulate rigidity.
For multi-position mattresses, there is no need to take spring mattresses because it does not respond to position changes.
Alongside the rigidity of the blades, what is called a shoulder bracelet can also be installed.
It is a special bond of the blades that allows pressure to even incline the blade so that the shoulder of the sleeper "integrates" well.
For men who have "the shoulders as wide as the back", this is really an important thing.
This is already considered by the mathels manufacturers who for the "males" have begun to use a repressive area at the shoulder level.
But they also think of women - they again offer them a softer surface at the hips level.
For the most difficult customer there are somiums with wings or platelets with what is called a multi-force suspension.
Pressure decreases in more points and lowers tension.
But of course, attention, as soon as you use a bad earring (large and airy) on good mattresses and sweat, the "plus" disappeared.
The basic rule is a simple earpiece: the earpiece must support the head and its points must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavia by example prefers.
When lying on the side, the earpiece must be leveled (with the shoulder blade or the shoulder-brained area in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first straw and grass based.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also in the bio-matelles.
Petroleum-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is produced, are replaced by natural oils such as soya oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use just the soybean.
"The bio qualification for mattress means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petr vasicek of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for carpet coverings; one of the first was the true aloe.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop scents of forest or lavender.
There are differences between men and women.
While the extract of bubble plants so that the carpet coating absorbs the heat and cools the body, "frozen" the man, the blankets "heat" the women.
The red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore hotter for low sex.
The current favorites?
The mattresses made from cold mousse (it has more pores with a disrupted cell structure therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of various stiffnesses of cold flies gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, bottom of the back and feet is.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7,000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as health instruments.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex has reached first place.
Saving for mattresses and mattresses is not easy.
There may be a time-frame for special actions on the part of manufacturers or producers of two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex company that offers Duofreeze mattresses with memory mouse worn on the cover for 11990 crowns.
Of course we can take the second free.
The age of paresian or viscoelastic mice with an open cell structure and a large thickness was started with the Tempur material at a "cosmic rhythm".
This began as a matter for NASA because astronauts were subject to the start of huge load factors.
The Tempur shrinks to the heat and hardens, on the contrary, to the cold.
It therefore perfectly adapts to the warm human body and distributes it optimal pressure.
It is ideal for this against bad sleep and for increased comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic musts are used not only for mattresses but also for products for health, such as special cushions for feet that lighten the legs and the neighboring system.
The Czech manufacturers use, for example, the EucathermC or Twinsaver fly or the same type.
Devices to monitor people are increasingly being asked by parents who want to monitor their children.
The fear of their child leads more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars, can also be used to track the movement of people and help in some cases, such as that of Little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is now as large as a box of bulbs but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of Little Anicka has emanated a large number of people and they have begun to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their private lives.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not a spy but only another way to reduce the likelihood that there is another tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I'm beginning to think there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting them in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I haven't met such cases yet."
"Most people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons, add Pilin.
According to him, children should always know the purpose of "the box" and how to use it in case of emergency.
The psychologist for children, Dana Bockova, points out that if the child does not want to wear something like this, he will get rid of it.
'And even smaller ones can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something when they don't want to be under control."
"The mobile phones, which can cut themselves like these tracking devices, have already brought their parents to long expectation," says Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of aggression is very controversial.
"If this is a prepared rap, the author will do anything to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate him."
"Currently, it's the phone."
"As soon as the tracking devices develop, they (criminals) will also search for them because the sale will be supported by a advertising campaign."
"In such cases criminals will always be in advance on the police," says the psychologist.
It recognizes as well as such devices can help during unprepared aggression by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, who offers tracking services both for cars and for people, claims that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of aggression.
"The device may be set in such a way as to be in regular mode after a specified period."
"In the case where the device is destroyed, it remains the last position of the person concerned."
'The most expensive devices also have a tiltimeter that immediately signals the position of the person who has slipped and is found in a position along the distance without moving,' says Cech.
According to him, portable phones called intelligent ones that are equipped with a navigation system can offer a comparable service after having formatted it with a special proological.
The problem with the current tracking systems is that it is a device similar to that which is carried in the size of an alumina box or to the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of the company Macro Weil, that is why tests are currently being carried out to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that any aggressor will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he will realize it after a while, which will give the police a little more time," he added.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as to track cars.
This is a combination of GPS position acquisition systems (which is commonly used in self-navigation) and a function of a mobile phone that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating ropes that it could tour the Czech Republic with it, but it can only hold two years.
The army bought 445 km of ropes used for explosives.
Already last year, the Ministry of Defence had bought it 224 km.
The army therefore has reservations for 225 years.
The problem is that the life span of the cords is two to four years maximum.
The army bought detonating strings to the anonymous company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The general state has given as a reason for a huge amount of detonating strings to MF DNAs that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations made by military pyrotechnics, which MF DNAS contacted, it appears that even the generals, officers with a command, secretary or household personnel should have an explosive exercise every year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of detonating cords.
At this distance there are 25,000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the Army's reserves could be subpoenaed for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals, more than 2 m of detonating cords, as the experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has secured, with also the consumption of special units and engineering, reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
However, the rapid intervention brigade soldiers recently complained to Minister Vondra that they had almost no ammunition for their poking weapons and that shooting sessions were limited due to money needs.
We don't talk about the lack of body linen.
"And I don't mind if they buy us so much detonating strings."
"And that's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"for us the army is a good client that we strive as traders to content," says STV Group Jan Decky's commercial director.
Jan Pejsek, spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence, argues that hundreds of miles of detonating cords will be held by the army in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, states only four years of life of detonating cords and the pyrotechnics of the police and army for only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the deposits, it may even go up to four years," says a two who do not want his name to be published in the light of the military's criticism.
The length of life has passed, each ammo must be tested to see if it remains integrated and does not threaten the soldier's life.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the department is a reduction due to the quantity of detonating heartworms for 445 km.
"They cost us 60 per cent less than the last year's supply of 245 km," says Pejsek spokesperson, who interprets the opinion of the defence department's buyers.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of detonating strings of police pyrotechnics that neutralize the ammunition of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army does not exceed 1500 metres.
And the police always order only the amount of ammunition needed to be used before the end of their life.
This has been developed for safety reasons for pyrotechnics and to be able to obtain more flexiblely the types of more modern and reliable detonating cords.
the Ministry of Defence today has major problems for the neutralization of dozens of tons of ammunition coming from the Warsaw Pact when the strong Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, head of the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNEs has contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometers of detonating old ropes that it buys today "in the good market".
So far, I am making use of contacts that I have obtained through competitions.
The free sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun to win the best individual Entrepreneur's competition.
The winner of the best Entrepreneur for the past year was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure to success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun likes to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberia there was a lack of quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned when he was working abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he bought a small building from 5 half-demoli apartments.
Knowing that he was still studying in the third year of higher education, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between the quality and the price of a accommodation in our region has given me a desire to do something," said Lucas Pytloun.
He started renting the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
He reinvests the benefit in the building that he converts into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his employer's action has allowed him to open 4 guesthouses, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four stars Pytloun hotel design.
This year it became another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our concept of franchise and other candidates to the franchise of Pytloun hotels," number 1 of entrepreneurs of last year.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory at the competition of the entrepreneur of the year served well, adds Pytloun with appreciation.
The victory has brought him more popularity and to be known in Liberia and its surroundings.
"People recognized me in the streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win, but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says that he still uses his contacts and knowledge that he could not otherwise obtain.
"With those I met thanks to the competition, I began to maintain trade relations regularly.
According to him, the reputation for success has also had an impact on employees.
And it's about 70.
"I observe in them the loyalty and pride of being committed to something that has been generally recognized."
"It is not, and far away, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of us all together.
"Only my name is moved forward," says Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than what we had at Farmet.
The epoch of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the goal of the Farmet winner has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to find the prize in Slovansky dum for the first place of the competition for the Firm of the year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the Farmet company.
The jury has rewarded the efforts with which it has transformed a tool workshop in Ceska Skalice into a 100 million crowns business firm.
'I can say that the reward has not only encouraged me and my collaborators and increased our confidence in itself to fight competition,' the winner of last year's competition said today.
At the beginning of the story of Farmet there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of the goods by the communists, he did not hesitate long ago, refused a career in a company where he was working at the time, and created a company with a few friends around his father for the manufacture of plastic baths.
Not long after they began specializing in the plant oil press.
He became the largest auto press manufacturer in Central Europe after eighteen years.
The company was even known in the non-specialized audience after the success of the competition through the media.
"Not only have our customers started to know the Farm brand really better, but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they were working with a company that has achieved the greatest success in its country of origin," says Karel Zdarsky.
But the last year did not happen to Farmet only during the conquest.
The evaluation of the company was based on the economic results of 2008 and in part 2009.
And just in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the top of the crisis, which did not really touch the citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and start limiting their acquisitions of new equipment and technologies.
"We obviously didn't escape from this situation."
"Business figures have fallen by 40%, and we have to limit our production and even licensor," says Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that it is time to take unpopular measures.
But they managed the situation correctly and kept the benefits even if they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued to invest in research and development without compromise.
"We have built a training and research centre with the funds, strengthened the presentation of the company in international exhibitions and won the main rewards in national exhibitions," Zdarsky says.
We all think the crisis is behind them.
Business figures also increase the number of employees with them.
"To a new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that eliminates the insanity of regulations.
The survey on the absurdity of the year is for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could have been deleted.
The little glorious winner of this year's investigation into the absurdity of the year was the obligation to provide documents that staff members can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4,000 votes cast.
For example, the social affairs administration requested a paper extract from the trade register while the official can obtain it in two mouse clicks.
It changes through the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require the withdrawal of the trade register for insurance payments checks," said Jana Buranova, spokesperson of the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To highlight all the regulations and orders that companies and entrepreneurs must fill in the Czech Republic and to remove those who are absurd is the meaning of this year's absurdity competition.
This survey is still this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even more popularity.
If 3,000 votes have been cast last year, at least 4,000 votes have been cast this year.
And it is not surprising that in our country there are the most different legal obligations that only hinder the company, and, more and more.
"We may be in the number of documents to be completed for tax returns in the first place in the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of enterprise activity has become a declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is at 74th place with regard to the conditions for the company, 8 more places than last year.
The year's absurdity competition was launched for the first time in 2006 and continues every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone who can report on the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities of April at the end of September each year, the last time before the closing of the competition.
To report on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then the competition organizer selects seven candidates for "antiprix" and allows the public to vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that has received the largest number of votes is declared a winner.
Until the last survey last year, it is one hundred, or more precisely 105 regulations and decrees that have lost their meaning.
The notes are sent by entrepreneurs but also professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, for example, there is a requirement that motor vehicles and fast roads pay wages, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, do two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which always began at the beginning of November on Place Venceslas in Prague, is a part of a celebration that regularly participates in the personalities of political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for Small and Medium Enterprises of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the closing date of the competition.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the state puts velocities in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this reason my goal is to remove, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs which today only complicate the company," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to eliminate absurd decisions is not a sword in the water.
In 2007, what people did not like was the obligation of entrepreneurs to report three days before the office for the individual company to the place where the company is located, the intention of going to an exhibition or pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was deleted with the amendment of the Individual Company Act.
The second most pronounced obligation in 2007, which was to declare to the Labour Office a service trip for a foreign employee in 30 days, was deleted with the text of the Green Card Act.
And everything is okay until the third session of the competition.
The absurdity of 2009 was decided for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic balances.
This has been changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year- the obligation to have a refrigerator has been deleted.
A new category rewards the socially responsible firms.
Ecological, humanitarian, training or sports projects are evaluated.
This year's novelty of Hospodarske Noviny's competition, which has been in existence for 5 years, is the category called the Responsible Firm of 2010.
The objective of this competition is to support the reasonable and just company.
"We want to support companies that monitor the environmental impacts of their business and lead a socially responsible activity," says Patrick Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile phone operator, Vodaphone, who is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the year's rebel competition.
For this first year of this subcategory of the 2010 firm competition, organized by Vodaphone, companies that have not succeeded with a single long-term objective for the company were registered.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article would be to be published.
Although the object of their business is different from that of each other, their support and predictability can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this applies to persons with disabilities and to the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the entire Czech Republic, there is no example of the company of proological Prague and Netera that supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports disciplines.
Another example of firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main contributor to the trust fund for 17 years that sponsors children with disabilities.
In the case of employees with health problems, the old Podebrad paper factory, which employs more than 70 per cent, is still mentioned, and has therefore received the title of the company Responsible for the Central Bohème Region and has been the third in the region at the Vodaphone-organized firm's competition for the year.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who has won to have introduced flexible and even reduced working hours up to 35 hours a week on average and, without, proportionally, a reduction in wages.
The jury also gave him the title because he was buying in priority for the Czech manufacturers, supporting a ditoyan activity in the vicinity and concerned about the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our business activity and our administration have the least environmental impact," explains Miluse Ryznarova, the executive director of society.
the company responsible IT Log in to the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and has installed a chair and ergonomic keyboard for each laptop, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected plant for its actions.
"We also support the foundation The man in the shadow that helps the local Roma community," said Ondrej Suchy, the representative of society.
At the last level, there is also a washing and cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the pension insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above standards.
"In our company we contribute to food, transport, skills increase and leisure," said Joseph Strapac of the construction company of Bruntal Czasch, winner of the Moravia-Silesia region.
They were automatically registered in the responsible company category, all the regional finalists for the Vodaphone Company competition, who had responded to the questionnaires attached to the registration document and had sent it to the organizer before 15 August.
The incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the contest by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the companies in high school had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the Responsible firm but were not disqualified from the "principal" competition of the Vodaphone Year Firm."
"The independent registrations are not possible because they are a subcategory of the main competition of the firm of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison&Rose organization agency.
In the Lands Fund in Plzen, police arrested during a public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Plzen, the anti-corruption police have been arrested these last days.
The detectives passed the mints to the local contractor and traded by real estate Lubos.
He had endeavoured to manipulate a call for public tenders for the settlement of an application for a refund in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a certain candidate.
He was supposed to pay Lubos G. a half million crowns.
"For the moment, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person for a crime of initiation in the context of a call for tenders and a public competition," said Pravo, the chief of the Plzen Parquet of Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is forbidden to provide more explanations because the investigation is under way.
Police officers sent this 46-year-old contractor away after 24 hours.
In order to know how he could influence a public competition, we can only speculate on so little official information.
On a question from Pravo, the spokesperson for the Lubomira Cerna Land Fund indicated that police officers had actually arrested Plzen at a separate place of work and that during the public competition.
"It was a client and in no case an employee, it was specified.
The public competition according to Cerna has as its real name "Call for rights to transfer land under the Land Act" and is established when several legal candidates appear.
"These persons propose, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their right to retirement that must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"In accordance with the proposed rights, a class of buyers is established and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," the Fund spokesperson explained.
Lubos G. had, of course, the information concerning the persons who had registered in the appeal and, as it is himself, a person who benefited because having purchased a large number of refund rights, he had proposed to the candidates in the field not to participate in the competition.
And he no doubt fell for withdrawing.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his impalement.
Lubos G. had contacts far above the FdT standards.
It was in the case of the former head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for publishing land for which the decision to establish a construction had already been issued.
Only Lubos G. had obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, specifically in place and where access to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the mayor for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far higher.
The mayor was obliged to accept because otherwise she could put construction at risk by a blockage of the land.
Households will pay an extra of a hundred crowns monthly for housing.
Households will have to pay an extra from January not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rentals will also increase.
So from January to January, families will have to draw up up to a hundred crowns each month more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, the gas of almost 2 percent more expensive, in some places you will have to pay up to a tenth more water supply and in many places central heating supplies will be also cheaper.
The increase in electricity should be expected for the apartment households of 100 crowns annually more than currently.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices, given the development that is sensitive to encouraging the production of renewable energy, including photovoltaic batteries.
The gas increases moderately but of course when people need it most to heat it and therefore have the greatest consumption.
So we can also count a hundred more crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
These are mainly the largest municipalities that plan to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 crowns a month, and the Liberian families will pay more than 1,000 crowns a year.
For the inhabitants of Prague, an increase of 9 per cent is prepared for water and sanitation in case the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rents do not change the price, an additional 6.8 per cent will be paid.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest compared to the whole country.
In North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation increase by 7.4 per cent.
Rent prices will, for example, increase significantly in the 450 thousand rental apartments from January, that is to say at the end of the regulation.
For example, CPI Byty, which has almost 2,500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided to increase up to 100 percent.
Those who disagree with the new increase in rents will be translated into courts by society.
Regular rents paid by people in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase the next year by 10%.
The Czech children are bathed in rum and fernet. The beer is no longer fashionable and it acts mildly.
Fernet, rhum, vodka and in an exceptional way the best brand of whiskey are also stolen to parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who are healthy, who are not yet 15 years old, between the hands of the doctor.
Children who are hospitalized for relapse do not make the exception.
This results from the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases to hospital child admissions.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be healthy."
'The trend is really strong,' says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the Children's Hospital of Horovice in central Bohemia.
"When they manage to chip a bottle of papa in the closet, it's some time of whiskey, but it's the fernet and vodka that prevail."
"The vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus do not feel it," explains the Head of Department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesperson for the Motol hospital, also gives her reason.
"In general, it's rhum or fernet."
"It's alcohol in fashion today, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it has been slavovice that they have returned from the house," Jurinova added.
According to the Head of the Department of Pelikan, seeing children from thirteen to fourteen years of age to hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol, where he spent ten years just in pediatric care, where ambulances were taking students from the wide areas of the Ivorian region.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times
"She began her 12-year career when she was taken with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood with an increasing mix with ecstasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Park of Halloween Exhibitions at a party."
"What's interesting is that it doesn't seem strange to the mother that her daughter is missing 48 hours," said the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the disinterest of parents or their toleration outside the community in the face of the fact that their rejection of alcohol is the main cause of the development of child alcoholism.
According to experts, however, it is not about child dependence in its strict sense.
"There is a chronic dependence on alcohol over several years with all the phenomena resulting from it, but it is not found in children."
"With those who use alcohol at repetition, it is rather a significantly disadvantaged socio-family background," explained the Chief of the Pélikan Department.
According to Jurinova spokesperson, about forty Ivre children were hospitalized this year until mid-November at the pediatric clinic in Motol.
They are integrated into the statistics only in cases with severe poisoning requiring hospitalization.
Iron children who are after emergency care returned to them by their parents or by the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, Pélikan insists that three seasonal waves can be counted: the day of the sorceries, the holy Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"They drink after bad results, or they celebrate the beginning of vacations."
"Of course I lived on the day of the sorceries a admission of 7 Ivre children at one time," Pélikan said.
The child who spent the night at the hospital in detoxification under medical control is paradoxically in a better position than the one who returned home and suffered the next day of the "wood mouth".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by a glucose infusion and nutrients needed by the body.
"They're better lotus for this because they spend an excellent evening and then a gentle wake and nothing hurts them."
"They are only surprised at the place where they are," adds Pélikan, knowing that from time to time this robs the good mood of the patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Transportation by ambulance and hospitalization on intensive care bed can go up to tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I have applied this as a means of education by counting on these children how much their work cost and that they could spend the whole summer in seasonal work to pay back one night," Pélikan added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their retirement management, which should recover from parents the care-related burden, do not deal with cases of Hebrew children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two L-159 of the five aircraft in total, against which the Ministry of Defence exchanged transport aircraft Casa C-295M, took off on Tuesday for Séville in Spain, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS sits.
This is the first time that devices of this kind become someone else's property than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad in the context of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the two-place versions of the L-159T1 that were still in service in the Czech army and were in flight.
The remaining appliances are L-159 single-place versions.
They are stationed for the moment at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the company Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Ministry of Defence Press Department, Vodochody's physical departure is currently unknown.
'The L-159 single-place scheduled for trade aircraft have been taken on long-term storage aircraft without additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence."
"The L-159 T1 Biplaces have been exchanged in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He stated that the army would not remain in place as the department signed an agreement with Aero Vodocoy in May 2009 with 200 million crowns for the transformation of four L-159 single-place L-159 unused in two biplaces.
The army received delivery of the first apparatus in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, it was committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of some of the Alliance's countries.
"The contract clearly states that the person taking into account the L-159 aircraft is EADS and that they will be used for training pilots from NATO member countries."
"It is therefore the case of the one who takes into account how to achieve it," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced, some time ago, that the Spanish army was not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for one aircraft Casa and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Department of Defence did not launch calls and contacted EADS directly.
the defence management argued when the exchange ensured a future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army has bought 72 devices in Aero Vodocody and uses only 24, which will sell the rest.
The purchase of aircraft is likely to have judicial implications.
However, the European Commission complained against the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected as part of a European call for tenders and in no case by directly contacting a manufacturer.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa planes, the latter should arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the yearbook is a low risk of cancer
Men who have longer index than the yearbook are exposed to a lower risk of having prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British journal Cancer.
This may depend on the level of hormone male testosterone.
"Our conclusions show that the relative length of the finger is a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men 60 years ago," said the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, professor at the Institute for Research on Cancer at Warwick University.
The finger could thus help determine which men should submit to the prostate cancer test, including by combining with the genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, she followed with her colleagues in Great Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index of right hand shorter than the yearbook.
For them as for 19 percent of those who had fingers of the same length, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
In the case of those who had the longer index than the yearbook, however, the risk fell by 33 per cent, for men before 60 years the risk reduction reached 87 per cent.
The length report of the two fingers - trained during the prenatal period - indicates, among other things, different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Unless testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research showed that it is just testosterone that helps develop prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he is aware of this study but that it does not seem to him that the relationship between the length of fingers and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under snow, the motorways D1 and D5 are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered by snow this morning.
On the roads and sidewalks, there is most of the time of the compact snow, the divers worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93th kilometres towards Rozvadov due to several accidents of trucks and cars and the D1 auroute in Brno towards Prague.
The driver of the central car club (UAMK) told the information
At the 91st km a truck was hit, at the 93st two heavy weights were hit, the accident caused injuries.
Several cars have also been found in the hole.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway to 185 kilometres in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks hit it.
Drivers should leave just after Brno at 190 km or go through Brno and then enter the 182 km in Kyvalka.
A number of cars from several kilometres have been formed in this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident, and that's just when we arrived in Prague.
In Prague, there is a snow layer of several centimeters thick, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Car lines are created in Prosek for example, Sterboholska Street is also closed.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
The tramways take from the delay, for example, on the line between Place Charles (Karlove Namesti) and Place of Peace (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning, the major state of the Prague crisis still has to meet.
Railways and airport also face problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove 7 fast connections due to snow.
The lines from Prague to Kralupy or much from Prague to Beroon have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne airport has been closed since Wednesday 11 a.m. at night until 5 a.m.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already rolling but by rerouting surveillance.
On the road of Vyskov, three side roads are impracticable, on the road of Brno it begins to have snowflakes in it and on the road of Blanco the chains are required to pass certain communication routes to the higher places.
The Vyskov region was one of the most affected areas.
So far, the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them, we may have to send snowflakes and snowflakes.
We can't estimate for the moment when they're rolling.
On the road of Hodonin, caution is rigorous in the White Carpathians region.
On the roads that are, given the protection of nature, maintained only by the aspiration of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 cm snow warning CTK.
In the Czech Republic, it fell between two and 10 centimeters snow; it fell most in Bohemia of the north, with often up to 18 centimeters snow.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, it fell to 15 centimeters of snow.
The enigma disappeared in the Czech Republic gradually.
The Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. Army sent to Afghanistan a new "intelligent" weapon known only under the name XM-25.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and will "change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super precise cannon
Its projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
The special munitions of 25 mm caliber developed for this rifle and containing a highly explosive explosive, actually works as small grenades.
The munitions can be programmed in such a way that they will explode in contact with the target, but also at any point in their ballistic path.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind a barrier, a wall or a hole.
It is no longer protected from above and when it falls over a deadly rain of steel cracks, it can also put it out of the fight.
According to Richard Audette, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "intelligent" technology.
"The soldier uses it essentially in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtaining a specific point of view, according to which he corrects his site and supports the relaxation.
"Let's say you've targeted 543 meters."
"When you press the rest, the weapon is loaded and fired at the distance of 543 meters more or less 1, 2, 3 meters," Audette said.
400 localized jobs
The Fujitsu group locates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July, 400 collaborators will transfer their place of work to Astro Park, which is currently located in the office building of Place Mareinbader in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese group Fujitsu locates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As stated on Wednesday by the specialist in computer manufacturing and maintenance, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located so far on the Marienbader square of Bad Homburg city, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge complex of offices located on Lyoner Straße Street of the Quarter Niederrad of Frankfurt.
A spokesman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, the group should group 100 other jobs still scattered in the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive. Astro Park's open-air offices are better suited to the working mode of the employees.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
Director General Bernd Wagner said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is a major location for us with remarkable infrastructure".
He argues that the connection to the airport is just of great importance to a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new movement of an important business within the region brought the joy of the winners yesterday and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The Head of Economic Affairs of the Municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "planetary actor" had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith concerning the place of implantation".
Fujitsu agrees with the city and its implementation is an important milestone for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (greens), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The management soon informed the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company," said Mr. Korwisi.
However, friendly relationships could not change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer against the owner of the Place Marienbader building.
In the end, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now to be avoided that such an exceptional place remains unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope the owner and builder of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of Place de l'Hôtel de Ville, used so far by Fujitsu and the nearby "vertical little" as well as the rest of the buildings of Place Marienbad, were part of the controversial construction project of the thermal station.
The result of a joint project by the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and the City Hotel. This created many criticisms, not only because of the impressive construction of the surfaces that used to be used in some parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment consulting company, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, the computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German Group of Immobilien-Chancen acquired the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the real estate fund Morgan Stanley. A year later, these buildings were sold back to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group in Tokyo is considered the third largest supplier of computer products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides the essential service.
Its branch established in the Rhin-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu has probably much more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to install in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7,000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park building.
This 20-year-old complex, whose name reminds of its star-shaped plan, covers, among other things, the seat of the Confederation of the Electronic and Electrical Industry.
Server expulsion by Amazon - Menaces v. M. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing more and more difficulties.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has expelled its servers from the site specialized in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may be hidden from political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, is apparently staying in England.
In the United States, Wikileaks is attacked with more and more force.
The cyber-activists group "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
During this time, prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman called the other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is sought by Interpol, is likely to stay in Britain, according to the information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excludes you from the Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom", cyber-activists reported on Wednesday (local time) the origin of the revelations via the social network Twitter.
Earlier, the cyber-business, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Following the publication of secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists have used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to reach the largest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Formidable, our dollars are now spent on caring for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem in Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
The CNN television channel, quoted by Mr Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon had banned Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation carried out by Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators.
The president of the Senate Committee for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against it, reported the British newspaper, "The Guardian".
"I wish Amazon would take this step earlier in view of the previous publications by Wikileaks of classified information," said the senator.
At the same time, Mr Liebermann called on the other countries to refuse to use the servers on the platform.
"Wikileaks acts in an illegal, monstrous and unscrupulous manner. In doing so, it endangers and threatens our national security throughout the world," according to an independent senator's statement.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks disseminate the contents of stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is listed on the list of persons sought by Interpol.
According to information released by the London newspaper "The Independent", Australian 39-year-old living in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently qualified intrigues orchestrated by its detractors the prosecutions initiated against it by Sweden.
Wikileaks spokesperson, Kristinn Hrafnson, told London that threats had been made against the site.
"Calls were even launched for Julian Assange's murder."
That is why Assange is particularly concerned about his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That's why Wikileaks founder keeps hiding.
Hrafnson was clearly responding to statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the head of the revelations made by Wikileaks be pursued and executed for treason.
In Canada, the Chief Executive Adviser, Mr. Stephen Harper, said on television, obviously ironically, that Mr. Assange should be "killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a Drone".
During this time, a controversy broke out between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesperson for the American President, Barack Obama, described the fact that Mr. Assange had demanded the resignation of the Secretary of State of Hilary Clinton if he was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and had recently released himself to espionage activities.
"I don't know exactly why we have to take care of the opinion of an individual who owns a website," says Mr Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than the claims of a website."
The U.S. government now fully passes to the test bank the protection of its databases.
According to a White House communiqué, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Anti-Terrorism Centre, was appointed to be responsible for combating the fugitives.
Mr. Travers is responsible for establishing "the necessary structural reforms" made essential after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects the information.
In addition, the American government announced that it wanted to take care of the security of dissidents and militants if they were ever threatened by Wikileaks' revelations.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," said the spokesperson of the Department of State, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Glace
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice confectioners are being prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day start-up course for future glaciers has been very successful and attracted by visitors from all over the world.
In fact, where does all the ice come from?
Glacier and the ice machine.
Glacier, that is, in German the ice confectioner is a bit out of date, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of Italian icemaking.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the cooled glass with a spatula, has it in the glove and then starts selling it.
There is no need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about the ice can't avoid "Gelato-University" from the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of sorbates founded the ice university in 2003 so that ice creams out of its machines respond to high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day start-up course for future glaciers has been very successful and attracted by visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice are also offered and extended over several days. Also, practical sessions are organized in the private glacier.
In the midst of the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply risk achieving their burning desire for smooth ice.
This time, 40 participants came from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia, passing through Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of artistic education from California, is proud of the Slow Food movement. He wants to propose a quality European product in the country of industrial ice in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business manager and she wants to take out a few specials from this work for the nerves after a few years.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a glacier in Cairo.
One man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian household woman came because her children worship Italian ice cream.
The glacier master Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice.
It is determinant not only of good taste, but also of susceptibility and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training the cerise on the castle of the national superstructure and, in general, the south: "Italian ice is just the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romance."
The first step in the manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a large blender that heats up to 85 degrees thanks to an electronic program, then cools immediately to four degrees.
It then opens a tap installed on the machine: it comes out of a pasteurised white base cream, the foundation of all kinds of ice cream in milk.
The trainer is immediately asking: Is it possible to manufacture ice using only natural substances without stabiliser?
How can you give free course to personal pleasure in the experiment?
Mr. Luciano warned against letting himself be misled by the spirit of time.
He who speaks only of ice "made from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers, however: most often a natural product, for example from the cur wheat flour obtained from the guar hareicot.
Of course, it is possible to manufacture ice without using stabilizer, only it must be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will not shake anything but ice pellets.
Some modifications to the base mass are allowed.
This becomes more exciting with the aromas.
The master Luciano sets out the difference between the ingredients obtained in the fruit or confectionery of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powder and pasta.
"the suppliers will all try to refill you with dozens of flavoured ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
It is in sorbate recipes with sugar and fresh fruit.
It is in ice cream made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs, becomes a yellow cream and, when added from cocoa powder, constitutes the basis of all possible desserts to chocolate.
Now, all participants in the course must switch to the use of ice-cream machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to manufacture four kinds of ice: vanilla, chocolate, moka and noose with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural ingredients.
The different types of fruit ice are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more pure fruit: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
The ice on the nuts does not necessarily contain the taste of the nuts, when it consists largely of nuts.
Kiwi ice, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabiliser.
"Only a balanced mixture is the taste of a ice," says Luciano.
The manufacture of ice is a calculation exercise: if you use the fish purée with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar should be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is required for citric ice.
Luciano presents a device with which it determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (vinegroes are used to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate calculations.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires as much physical intervention as before.
It's not just the automatic machine manufacturing of the base mass that helps.
There is also a device that simultaneously beats the ice mixture available to make it intact and returned to negative temperatures.
In spite of all automations, small trays are not excluded.
Brazilian Gustavo barbows off the fruits of the head with his feet and, thus, smashes his study friends when the control of the colosal blender ball escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that "a similar incident may occur during each course: it is only a matter of time."
The controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that experimentes with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has undermined the European Food Safety Authority.
This charge is now formulated by the Testbiotech Expert Group, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"This sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well informed," said Munich M. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech.
Some information indicates that the president of the Efsa Group of Experts for Genetically Modified Plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi Pressure Group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has worked decisively to develop the test requirements of the Efsa for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to the criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The requirements developed are textually consistent with the Ilsi pressure group positions and thus bear the brand of the industry, which would, in the end, be controlled by the authorities established in Parme in Italy.
It's already the second time that Testbiotech denounces a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking manager of the Efsa recently joined the Swiss syngenta agri-food group without a transitional period. In doing so, she changed camp.
There was little time ago, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union's authority responsible for control and industrial lobbying, which raised suspicions of both the German Federal Agency for the Environment and European Members.
However, the Efsa does not accept the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry data, are used as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working for the Efsa account are not prohibited from contacting this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admitted that he worked for the International Institute of Life Sciences (International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi) based in the United States.
This body is considered as a neutral forum bringing together experts who, among other things, belong to science, industry and politics to assess the risks of biotechnology without being in the balance of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disagree with the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any food testing in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what are, for example, the effects of genetically modified maize caused by the field," said Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins, not all genetically modified plants, which does not allow reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, then how can you discover them?" Mr. Then asks about a defendant.
This is also Mrs. Angelika Hilbeck's point of view.
This scientist has been doing research in the field of genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region as well as in the United States and now in Europe, the industry sector is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are still hardly any researchers who are not related to companies.
In the opinion of the companies, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck said that "the industry controls security research".
The Stone Trace
Uli Gsell looked for it, at a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart's station with her back tube.
There was a manif.
He denied it.
The story is known: In September, the excavators had come and had begun to demolish a large part of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: several thousand people showed up against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart's central station into a underground station that would cost several billion.
A large part of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations led to the conclusion of the construction work.
Broken in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (Cailesheim calcareous calcareous), a tender and large paddle built badly between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfieldern.
A few pieces were searched for.
"These stones are remains."
"They don't have to disappear."
He declares with enthusiasm: "a modest and good market rock, simple and terrestrial."
He said that by cutting her off at school, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He still doesn't know what he'll do about this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
the traces of Stuttgart's stones lead to a former munitions deposit of the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man makes the trade of old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolishment that happened in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were framed or lost in the discharge," he said in his office in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He relates that he was subjected to insults and threats when in September the newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the north wing to the demolition company.
But he negotiated for days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it does, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue to use the stones.
Approximately 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently carried out one of the parallels of stone weighing an average of 80 kilograms, of which the value is between 6,50 and 14 euros.
Some keep it as a memory while also hoping to be able to do so during a reconstruction.
Rongen had got 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half is still stuck in the forest, the rest being sold for a long time.
Owners of gardens, landscapers, Particuliers.
They came from all over and took everything that could enter the chest and the trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long been transformed into "Mäuerle" or a limitation of grass-bands.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," said Mr. Rongen.
"it was this political component."
He enters his car all over the country, making the tour of his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He did some law studies that he left, and later he started studying biology before he became interested in computer science and finally became a career.
And a stone lover.
It stores 40000 tons.
He loves to treasure himself everywhere in Germany.
He claims to be the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's cooling up.
Art carved sand stones are placed on the snow.
"In the past, they were part of the Marienbrücke bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he says with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He's taking the road that goes through the forest.
It shows a bag of fingers: Pierre de sande red, previously part of the Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"Take the travertine."
The parallellipede was already part of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Throughout the snow of the stones and stories, the crossroads of Cannstatt from the police prefecture, the red granite from the Holy Blasien Cathedral, the tuft from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What a work, what a effort, what a sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that as soon as the stones were carved by hand and moved with simple pallets and carts drawn by oxen, he becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were put in place."
He didn't become rich, even less demanding.
But this career now employs 14 people. In addition, stone cutters, sculptor, forgeron, glass blower and gardener have settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's gratifying," says the waste recycling.
Next time, he has to go to Cologne.
There's some stones to save, too.
Fighting talent to win the highest potential
The accountant knows a living flow.
16 students go shopping for small bread in the salmon, tomato sauce and white food.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Volkswagen car manufacturer invited design and mechanical engineering students to a workshop.
As part of a kind of competition of ideas, they need to talk about the future car with VW designers, and, by the way, get to know the Volkswagen company.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body in the competition to destroy better brains and engage, like Volkswagen, in multiforme cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most dubious diplomats as far as possible in the amphitheaters before they reach the employment market and are not courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements on the performance of their students, we try to identify the exceptional talents in the context of practical projects and to trust them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the technical university of Brauschweig, the automotive group mastered the talents.
A young lady in the staff service shares styles, bonuses and cards containing the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the calendar of vocational courses and student jobs for young talent; she shows them the paths to access the group's seat.
It is Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig who is responsible for the project undertaken with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both parties: "Students come in contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, he can get to know the students, look more closely at the serious candidates and appreciate those who enter online as a collaborator."
According to Mr. Selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive with which we try to attract students.
"At the same time, the emphasis was placed on the professional project," says Mr. Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much more urgent.
Businesses can no longer recruit their collaborators in the property of the sectors by making a three on a jury of candidates.
But they have to boast of their reliability and, above all, brief the highly qualified laborer's hand.
These are mainly the diplomats from the engineering lines that are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German VDI engineers, more than 40,000 engineer posts remained unoccupied in October.
And according to VDI estimates, the gap in engineering positions will increase again.
Roman Dykta goes after talent for KPMG account, audit firm, accounting expertise and advice.
It organizes expensive events for talent recruitment, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of rally paper where competitors need to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel in this way to the United States.
Participants can access KPMG's subsidiaries and get to know the company.
The participant shall decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used to look for higher potentials in universities are becoming more and more important.
"We want to get out of the lot through the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little of a thing"
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"To this day, we have remained in touch with all the people who took part last year in a similar action."
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to send their requests to our company soon," he says.
In addition to the direct adjustment carried out in the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are performing in a classic way by participating in the professional fairs where they are being hunted by the brains.
"We try to reach the graduates by participating in the professional classrooms."
"For example, in the solar technology room," says Ms. Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Director at Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company is located in Bonn employs some 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe was aware of the problem related to the answer.
Currently, 35 posts are being awarded on the company's website.
"At this point, it is very difficult to have vacancies."
"That's expensive and takes a lot of time," you know?
Another way to establish contact is to go through university teachers.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, such as the University of Fribourg.
"Teachers indicate that the student has the opportunity to conduct professional courses or write his final study project at our home."
Honest advertising campaigns are announced among solar specialists.
This is why the company is trying to make its advertising by exercising other qualities: personalized environment, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Sometimes a large group can't do that," says Ms. Stübe, head of staff.
For a long time, money has no longer played a major role in the search for employment.
The other determining factors are flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities.
According to a study conducted by the Institute Great Place to Work, Solarworld occupies 55th place among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute is an annual honour of German employers.
To this end, it asks the employees about their degree of satisfaction in relation to their work and its context, while looking at the conditions of the staff framework.
The head of staff, Ms. Stübe, hopes that this placement will allow the company's image to be expanded to employers.
"I think that candidates are particularly committed to external evaluations with respect to a potential employer," she said.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Academy, DEBA) advises companies that wish to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means first of all internal action.
"The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through his own collaborators," he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own real estate.
"the satisfied collaborators form the best messengers."
When we treat his employees well and they identify with the company, they only advertise their employer to their friends and knowledge.
"It's like we were playing in an orchestra," says Mr. Kriegler.
Obama puts a stop to new oil drillings
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico beyond the coast of Florida, the state of the South-East of the United States, over the years to come.
The Washington Government has issued a ban An equivalent ban and thus definitively annulled its initial plans.
Even beyond the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains for the moment prohibited.
The Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar made this announcement on Wednesday.
It is the explosion, in April, of the "Deepwater Horizon" drilling platform, which is at the root of this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
In the face of this accident, which cost 11 employees and leads to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, who was under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, indicated that he was willing to authorize new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The participants of this solution thus want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries in terms of oil supply.
The question of who is responsible for the devastating black tide in the Gulf is not, to date, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which is faced with several billion claims for compensation, is at the centre of the charges.
A committee of inquiry established by Obama must present its findings on December.
In October, the Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the ice from the hole decreed after the explosion of the platform.
Following this decision, different oil groups immediately submitted requests for new drilling projects.
With stricter control measures and more stringent safety signals, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which was discriminated against after many corruption charges, is currently subject to deep reforms.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced that he would eliminate the lucrative tax niches of gas and oil groups.
The actors in this sector are now publicly warning against the fact that the supply flow in the Gulf would be significantly lower than is the case so far.
"The goal of the government is to put a stop to the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector" according to the results of a current survey carried out in the sector by the audit firm BDO before the ban on drilling issued on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Energy Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been deferred to a new order, to the detriment of growth.
The country of Ogoni is dry
The water flowing in the rivers is poured brown; it smells like that in the gas station: Because of a leak, billions of litres of crude oil destroyed the country of Ogoni in Nigeria.
Men live from stealing, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has good intentions.
"Don't get exhausted," the environmentalist militant launched to the journalists to calm them down: "You still have enough oil powder in front of the water lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian attempted to photograph a young man immersed in the boiling water up to his chest, as well as the thick draw surrounding him: this scene seems almost beautiful in the water splinter at the color of the arc-in-the-cile.
We can't see that the basement is filled with brown crude oil nappies.
On the banks of the Bodo-Jetti River, Esther Badom tells us that, although she was collecting shrimps by whole lakes here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely tari.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil had jailli of an oil pipeline that had exploded in the huge marecquerade.
Fishermen living in the small neighboring town of Bodo now have to climb for six hours to reach fishy waters: The country of Ogoni located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
All the extent of the ravages comes to the eye when you travel through the mangrove seas through watercourses.
Instead of a clear water, the motorboat closes a brown brown water. Anyone filling his hand with it removes any oil cover.
The roots of small mangroves emerge from the ground like clay barrels. The isolated palm trees allow their palm trees to be hung sadly.
We are looking for the nests of birds, as we usually meet in the wet areas: Once the off-board engine stops, a fantastic silence falls on this paradise of times that resembles a smell-service station.
"What is happening here is a war against the environment," says Mr. Celestine Akpobari of a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live is a battlefield inhabited for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. It was executed later. In 1993, the Shell Group had to interrupt its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Today, the return to the country of Ogoni is still prohibited for this company: while over 2 million black barrels are pumped daily through over 5,000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometers of oil pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields of Ogoni are unexploited, because the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
All the few hundred meters rise in the water of steel wood as strange sculptures: The heads of drilling holes are very affectionately referred to as Christmas trees.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them are rubbed by corrosion to the benchmark.
Akpobari believes that a drilling head of this nature falls from time to time in pieces, because a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion litres have been spent on the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that that occurred in the sea during the "Exxon Valdez" super-oil accident 21 years ago outside Alaska, one of the largest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Who should bear responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? The answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell group, the sabotage and syphonation of the pipelines is responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution. Environmentalists consider the explosions of drilling heads and drilling pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, American researcher Richard Steiner appealed to the Shell Group to apply safety standards to Nigeria much less stringent than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of failure of conduct is "even higher than then".
Some forms emerge from mangroves to a place that, in view of the distance, resembles a abandoned workshop, full of vans and outdoors: they are completely naked and covered with vans up to the neck.
A sparkly fire under one of the many tunnels that are often connected to the pipes, often spread without reason on the site, must be referred to: a small clandestine refinery.
The oil is heated in the tunnel for several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
In the first time, the essence penetrates into a container by passing through tubes, then, at the end of the conduction of kerosene drops falls and it is finally obtained from diesel.
This is how Michael and his four collaborators produce four 300 litre Diesel sticks daily: "This reports us 34,000 Naira", about $22.
The people of Delta take advantage of the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil producing country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illicit refiners can sell at a price less expensive than the ridiculously low of only 40 cents of Euro per litre of Diesel: because they buy their raw material free of charge.
It is offered by the "protectors" who destroy the oil pipeline network across the country of Ogoni. According to experts, the country thus loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a small part of the raw material temporarily stored is illegally cleaned: The organized crime networks that also include high-ranking politicians and military members, charge the lion's share in tanks and the world market brand.
The Akpobari militant considers that the debate on the question of whether environmental disaster should be attributed or not to subversive activities in the population or in the lexist mode of production is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of fishermen's life were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no flight and illegal refineries."
But, in the meantime, Ogoni's relations especially with Shell have deteriorated so much that it was no longer a matter of withdrawal from the group. "Perhaps the operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will become better."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It's a long time for you to get rid of it" announces the robust oil worker.
"Soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be the subject of arrest, but at the very least they will be offered wine pots.
Even soldiers from the north of the country mainly intend to benefit as all Nigerians from the raw material.
"In any case, this trick has made our country very low," Akpori regrets.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 reactors
The A380 is clearly suffering from a major security problem.
When examining an emergency landing device, the investigators discovered a possible failure of construction that could lead to "catastrophic failure of the reactor."
The Qantas airline now wants to bring complaints against the reactor manufacturer.
At the beginning of November, passengers from the Airbus belonging to the company Quantas had apparently had a more chance: During the investigation carried out, the Australian air safety authority found that the reactors of certain A380 devices had a serious safety problem, and it warned against a possible failure of construction.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: It may cause fatigue and leakages at the level of the connection of the oil conduct, it is indicated in a position published this Thursday by the administration of the ATSB.
It could have led to a "catastrophic failure of the reactors".
These are the reactors manufactured by Rolls-Royce and equipped with 20 aircraft from the A380 series.
The Airbus of the company Quantas, which had to land urgently on 4 November in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now initiated judicial proceedings against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a judicial complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, which gives her the opportunity to take other legal measures against society.
The Director of Quanta, Mr. Alan Joyce, said that his company would claim damages for the incident that occurred in early November.
Parts have been decomposed and the bearing surface has been damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is oil inflammation that is the origin of damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators announced that other safety tests will be carried out on the superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The security recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASTB spokesperson Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered sufficiently important to inform all parties concerned.
After an emergency landing of his plane, the air carrier Quantas immobilized the entire fleet of A380 for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily immobilized three of its 11 A380.
Lufthansa replaced the A380 reactor by precautionary measures.
The two-storey plane is the largest plane in the world.
Snowfall in the whole of the territory causes chaos in transport
All white cover Germany: In one night, snow fell on almost all of the country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany grelotter: By ice temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered by snow on Thursday night, leading to chaos in many places.
In the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimeters per area.
Traffic is very limited on several motorways and many roads.
On National A7 in Flensburg, the winter service staff were working on a permanent basis, but they were unable to come to an end of the snow that never stopped accumulating.
In addition, rarcal violence swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Bureau for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) is expected to host a series of ras-de-marées on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels of up to 1.2 m above normal.
The snowflakes on highways and on federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the bad weather alert centre Meteomedia announced the level of violent alert was announced in the Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
In places, it fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong and cold winds scattered.
Several trucks and cars remained stuck there the night.
Even in the Saxe-Anhalt country, police authorities have announced serious road disturbances.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind caused a disruption of the movement and caused noise.
In Thurnge, snowfalls hit A4 and A9 motorways.
According to the Deutsche Bahn, serious disruptions to rail traffic occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and north of Bavaria.
The main problems are the snow on the railways, the trees fell on the railways, the chains or the damaged needles.
In Saxe, the interregional transport of Leipzig-Nuremberg had to be interrupted.
In Salfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to stop its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to provide 165 passengers on the train in blankets, food and drinks.
Snow winds swept the roads.
The Snow Chutes led to many cancellations of flights in the main airports in Germany.
According to a standard password and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport indicates that 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt on Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that passengers at the airport are no longer numerous, although only 400 beds are available.
Accidents occurred on many roads on Wednesday afternoon.
On the night of Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life during a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snowfalls on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was jumped to a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, so the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car hit a slippery shoe in Ashharenburg.
However, meteorologists announce a good news: snow will certainly always be soft and dusty, but it will turbulence in the case of mild refals.
But the wind is going to faint.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by violent and fast winds.
However, it is very cold, up to 15 degrees per place.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin tours.
The deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to newspaper reports, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could report up to EUR 500 million.
The Deutsche Bank has just removed the seat of the group: The twin tours located in the Business Quarter have been modernised; while the bankers had to return to their former place of service.
In the meantime, the financial group clearly seeks to recover the costs of renovations and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland" quoted as a spokesman.
This password did not indicate the reasons for the proposed sale.
He said, "We verify whether it is more interesting to occupy the properties ourselves or to sell them, and to reinstate them later."
Thus, the largest financial institution in Germany has already given up its seat, shortly after.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank acquired the twins for an amount of EUR 272 million from own funds holders, and they were then remunerated.
The transformations aimed at energy optimization amounted to approximately EUR 200 million, according to some indications.
Of course, a sale reported a lot of money to the bank.
According to the information provided by the newspaper, experts in this business sector estimate the value of the tours, which were rebaptized between "Green Tours", to some 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesman, it is currently not known whether the real estate will be resold to a fund belonging to the bank or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the minors who have lost.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for juveniles who were declared dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
The safety situation of the sinister well continued to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 had been buried on the ground.
A probe had been introduced into the sinistered well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no relief teams were able to descend into the mine for security reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and administration considered that the minors had no chance of survival.
So far, the bodies couldn't be lifted up.
Today, parents and friends have organized a memorial party for the dead.
Thousands of people were gathered under a sun blowing in Greymouth south of the New Zealand island.
They noticed two minutes of silence.
In memory of 29 minors, 29 tables were installed on which names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
The photos and personal effects, including the clothes and surfboards, were also present.
Flags have been installed in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants at the commemorative party that New Zealand had given hope that the minors would return to the surface.
"But they never returned home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was found in the woods, said that he could not refuse to accept the death of his son until he had seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the victims' parents, several foreign diplomats attended the commemorative party.
South African and British minors also celebrated the first explosion on 19 November.
Rescuers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Police chief Gary Knowles explained to reporters that when the mass of explosives is moved, the burning temperatures inside the mine began to fall.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the Splater movie an artificial film?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the old-fashioned kind thanks to his film, "Wallala Rising", the age of the fighter.
To what public was the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn well thought through the Wallalla Rising tour?
A warrior Viking (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is made prisoner; he frees himself from his burrow and, with a almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents after each other. This seems ideal for young male spectators seeking a bloodthirsty action, precisely because our hero uses methods of brutal murder. When he is ill-humoured, he pulls the guts of his enemies without waiting for them to die.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the bourgeois does not say a word on his real name. Even the other characters leave, at the top of it, at the turn of one or two phrases, some exuberant agony of agony.
Otherwise, nothing is said and celebrated in the incredibly beautiful mountain landscape of Scotland, which is the decoration of the Vikings universe, about a thousand years ago.
This would be more ideal for mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travel.
When a film is aimed at several target groups, it is a pity that they are mutually excluded.
The director Winding Refn is considered, since the release of "Pusher", his trilogy regarding the drug dealer Farouche and full of style, like a sort of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more humor to the dominant current or introduce a little less brutality to the art and trial film.
Most art movie sympathians have to experience the horror of the brain that spreads around and into the intestines.
The action film lovers are bored when the village gets on board, for reasons that one can freely interpret, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship to Jerusalem; they are drowned for eternity by the calm and the storm before the crew arrives in America and continues to faint.
It is not surprising then that "Wallala Rising" did not find any film distributor in Germany and that it exists only in the format of the DVD.
It is especially because of the magnificent images of the misery that have earned some attention, but also because the image of a dazzling film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not dialogue in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is an atmosphere, a festive dream transformed into a film.
The viewer can't escape.
Refn gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with glamorous images and a lugular sound band, but especially with unsatisfied hatred that cheers the heart of the characters.
Only a young blonde boy, who is faithfully standing next to the village, preserves some innocence, all others are animated by anger.
More than anything, the bourgeois hero whose mobiles are never known, but who comes back from hell at any time to fight enemies and provisionally allies by turning himself into a warrior, may be sent from the devil himself.
It represents corruption, but perhaps also, nothing but for those who are, in any way, able.
"Wallala Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, which for the purpose has passion, enthusiasm and wonder.
A traumatic experience.
Mysteries of the Terrasement
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications regarding a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this issue, even less to submit to the Agency's controls.
On the night of 5-6 September 2007 at midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I hunting planes attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building in the Syrian territory.
It is located on the shore of the Euphrates; the largest city in the vicinity is 30 kilometres: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name is found in the IAEA documents, because it is a question of the reactor that Syria built with the help of North Korea in parallelliped stone, dissembled in a valley marked by the absence of electricity.
According to a United States briefing of information services, the CIA, at the end of April 2008, would be well equipped to produce plutonium, the current reactor known as the locality El Kibar, which would produce nuclear weapons.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video containing faint satellite images.
Through computer-aided animation, it indicated the likely location of each reactor component before the destruction of the power plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the nearby building, even inside the building.
It seems that the reactor was on the point of being put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, we have only more information than at the time, and even, over time, the mystery disappears more and more.
The former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that prior to the attack, the CIA was certain that Syria had built a reactor to el-Kibar, but had little evidence showing that this country had developed "a nuclear-weapon-active programme".
Some information agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a "presumptuous reactor", even if they consider the CIA to be "flexible".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Questioned about how it was ensured that it was dealing with a nuclear reactor, a high-ranking United Nations diplomat gave only a laconic answer in summer, stating that the IAEA had “adequate documents to ask questions”.
The Syrians certainly hurriedly removed the demise of the "unutilized military building" and made a methodical landing of the land.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team of experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered in El Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, the IAEA has received from a Member State images of commercial suppliers satellites showing the moment that it directly followed the attack. It appears that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous commander, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
That is why it is impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always ensured that it has never carried out a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damas argues that uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
However, the IAEA claimed this argument after the analysis of the particles by qualified as impracticable.
Since then, ladies have been refusing any discussion on this issue, as well as on satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to conduct a second inspection on the El Kibar site and refuses access to the decompositions of the building destroyed by the bomb.
Yet, even Israel maintains an unbreakable silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in operation at the time of the attack, recently stated: "We will never comment on this."
This is how the investigation into this case has been taking place for a long time since June 2008 without a result and that it "becomes increasingly a serious credibility problem for the Agency", as a high-ranking Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna recognizes, it is ultimately a serious violation of the nuclear-weapon-prohibition treaty.
The IAEA considers that in order to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the three other facilities that must have "a functional report" with the alleged reactor.
So far, inspectors have not indicated which facilities it is, what their function is, or what they are suspected to contain.
According to the information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, respectively, as well as the names of the neighbouring cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security (International Institute of Science and International Security) of Washington identified these sites and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would be very likely one of the suspects.
It is possible that it is in a military base or directly beside it; that is exactly why Syria refuses to access the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is claimed that the Syrian rebuttal of the inspection team is actually spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by IAEA to spy on military facilities.
In fact, it is information provided by US secret agents that draws the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the parallel pipe of stone to transport substances.
A high-ranking Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "serve fuel production".
There would be "no indication of sensitive activities", such as the enrichment and withdrawal of uranium; processes that are essential to the production of nuclear weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to non-rich uranium.
However, there is the rigidity of plausible assumptions regarding the following fundamental issues: from where the uranium should have come and from where the plutonium required for the manufacture of the bomb would have been later separated.
It is not known whether the engravings, which could hide valuable traces, have been stored in the three sites.
When hundreds of land trucks have disappeared, no one will have information on the place of storage.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had examined in 1998 the salt mine of al-Tibni, located only a few kilometres from el-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, to see if it could agree to the storage of radioactive waste.
By recently analyzing photos taken by satellite on behalf of the famous Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley has established a link between them and the reactor in question.
However, photos taken by satellite show that Syria has undertaken landslide work in the three suspicious sites and has moved out of huge containers when IAEA has started demanding access to these sites.
This may be a coincidence, but this has not contributed to the exclusion of suspicions.
It said in the diplomatic environment that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan on the inspections to be carried out, which should allow Syria to preserve any military secrets. Only the time spent in the investigation shows how much interest inspectors have in this case.
During that time, Damas also put an end to this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not be reported on this case, for example, said Glyn Davies, the US ambassador who has been calling for a few months what is known under the name of the special inspections, one of the most powerful means available by the Atomic Agency to implement its controls.
The Director of the IAEA, Mr Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option that I am open to in the future", but he is still reluctant.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and a large number of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation rise.
on the other hand, like this diplomat who gives thought to: "It would be useful if at the end they found nothing"
Love in Time of War
It's been bad since Angelina Jolie started in the summer as a realist.
She wrote the scenario herself: it is a story of love between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
We don't know anything more about this story, but that's enough to cause the malaise.
A persistent rumor indicates that the Muslim woman fell in love with her Serbian burreau during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women's federations immediately protested. In response, some of the turnout sequences planned in Sarajevo were moved in the last minute in Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film was filmed in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continued in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women war-victims addressed Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (HCR) and requested her to meet the actress. Jolie herself is an ambassador of the UNHCR's good will.
She is not a diplomat, but a few weeks ago, she proposed to these women to meet with them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," Hasecic said.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario says quite a long time about her attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organization has subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner to withdraw the quality of goodwill ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, what kind of script did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which has received copies of its script, has given some hesitations a tour authorisation to Sarajevo, but we do not know why it has not then come.
The young author himself assures that she does not pursue political goals with her film, that it is making a lot of effort that she has been aware of the Yugoslav conflict, and she argues that she wants to exert the terrible consequences of the war and give all the parties involved the opportunity to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circle on the Net. It is quite different: Lovers knew well before the beginning of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
Which is still a big difference with the version "a victim of rape falls in love with her burreau."
That Jolie's film started well before the war, of course.
The pressure exerted on it, thus expressed by Jolie, is "injustice and based on wrong information".
Now, only Hollywood fans can bring peace to him: By illegally putting this scenario in the Net, like many others before.
Let's get out of here!
Tonight, everything goes well again with the Irish.

Cian Tanner is a quiet individual; this subtle drinking game and the reserved computerist, these two behaviors really don't go well together.
And yet, the 26-year-old man is trying to have fun, to turn away from the terrible issue, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his projects. In January, he will conduct employment interviews in New Zealand.
"I try a strange feeling, however," he says.
"The country is so far away and I don't have a job."
Finally: Her girlfriend is already waiting for her in Auckland, "in less than two, she's decoupled her desired job as an event project manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man smiling.

His sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, and his brother Colin now serves as a computer consultant in London.
Young people go: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of the tanners.
Experts from the Institute of Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even provide for a number of 200,000 immigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these forecasts are realized, it will be a similar emigration rate to what Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish enjoyed a great deal of relief, sorrow now takes the whole place.
However, the economic crisis affects mainly Irish young people, well-trained, who have so far only known happy times.
The loss of employment and the loss of social life seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's money in excess.
But, in the meantime, three people in ten less than thirty years are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper publishes a great deal of the letters of readers written by young immigrants who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes to the derivation."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the opportunity to do so will go away and our country will be a whole generation."

"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnnon try to address this topic positively.
McLarnnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" salon, which offers full support on the theme "Working abroad".
"But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps in the stages of the professional hierarchy," he said.

For six months, Seán O'Donovan knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
Since there was nothing more to be done in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A fashion house just comes out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannover or Berlin projects.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he participates in an additional job, so that he can complete the loan he has contracted to build his home in the country.
"The situation is already a little harsh," he says by crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I don't practically live anymore."
He bursts out of a throbbing smile through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-gardened front gardens, expensive cars with large brands are stationed on access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of EUR 380,000, financed 100 per cent by credit.
"There were moments of madness, no doubt, the money was easy," he says.
Is he afraid to see everything go wrong because of the credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, feels hot tea and says, "I don't have kids to entertain, and I'm young; even though everything goes through, I can go to zero."
The building engineer does not like the complaints he often hears in recent times.
"No one should suffer from hunger, our situation is not as dramatic as what we once lived in the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not what can happen worse, perhaps what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
"He was back after seven years and, in Ireland, life continued, simply."
This idea please Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and discover how life goes elsewhere.
In his palm trees, he already has a few years of work in London. That's why life doesn't have to be so easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still one thing that worries you well these last days: the party to be held on the occasion of its 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He's afraid she can't turn into a goodbye night.
"Only, not a lot of emotions," he says by drinking a long gorge of beer.
"Adieu, it seems equally worrying."
"Let's call it a night of recreation, all relaxed, bringing together some friends, with some drinks and some games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as well as for the private enterprise.
Crime has become more worrying than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in a large part of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarometer survey in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been carried out regularly since 1995, it follows the changes in attitudes in the region.
Two related elements are the results of this year's survey, carried out in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the South American Pacific (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a strong decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents to Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which reduces the regional average (see table 2).
Some 44% of the region's respondents were satisfied with the way their country's democracy worked in practice; this is the same figure as last year but with a strong increase of 25% in 2001 (Graph 3).
Some 34% said that they had confidence in their country's Parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but strongly increased compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America have wreaked support for democracy.
If this has taken place well during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in the United States have suffered only a brief recession and have received a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased slightly only in 2009 and decreased again this year to 32 per cent.)
But the humidity varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
What is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where recession has been more severe and where violent crimes have worsened.
This is only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see table 5).
Some 31% say that they or one of their relatives have been victims of a criminal act in the past year; however, this figure is down compared to 38% last year and is lowest since 1995.
Stronger economic performance is reflected in increased support for the private enterprise and the market economy: approximately 71% of the region's respondents say that private enterprise is essential for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see figure 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); although their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, ex-property of many private companies.
Brazil is the largest manager in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged compared to last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% since last year)
But the United States is considered to be the country most influenced by respondents to Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A suffrage vote
No one expected to have a perfect general election in Haiti on 28 November.
But it was much worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country sign up and spit in fear.
Voting boxes and a new ballot, ballot papers scattered in the gouts, suffocated ballot offices and intimidations were presented.
The polling stations would be open late in the evening.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced after the January earthquake, would be wrong in the neighborhood to find a place to vote.
Some of them ended up abandoning.
A dozen presidential candidates, several of whom were suspected, denounced fraud and claimed the annulment of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, views the event as "a pretty good election in many respects".
Observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said discreetly that they did not "believe that these irregularities, as serious as they were, had necessarily invalidated the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are remunerated to René Préval, is the unpopular president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is required to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second expected tour is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial appeal for the vote to be declared null.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has little or no perceived support from voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second tower reaching the second tower.
With an epidemic of cholera that rages, and more than 1 million survivors of the earthquake still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
On the occasion, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards needed to vote were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The challenge is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, of course, the Haitians do it themselves.
The point of feet towards the center
The weeks after becoming suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, has benefited from a wave of public sympathy that has improved its approval rate of 20 points, at more than 50%; this is its higher level since it was elected in 2007.
However, to turn this into a successful campaign for a second term in election next year could depend on Ms. Fernández's choice, apparently in mourning, according to which she would abandon the intransigence of her deceased husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the habit of developing budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend their additional income on a voluntary basis.
Ms. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has collapsed in the desert since Mr. Kirchner's death of a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the Peronist movement have joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (where a parliamentarian struck one of his peers on the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress did not approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president even greater scope for voluntary spending.
The economy is largely overheating: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now at 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade union wage claims, this figure is close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took up his post in 2003 when Argentina was afraid of economic collapse, gave priority to growth and poverty reduction rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, hacked the private sector, and charged INDIC, the statistical office, which conducted falsifications of official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And his staff say they want to limit the wage increases to 18% next year.
The economy has been stimulated by high global prices for agricultural exports in Argentina.
Inflation, however, led to a sharp rise in growth following a strong assessment in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández shows signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the government concluded an agreement with the debtors who had refused a previously forced restructuring of the debt for which Argentina had not settled its deadlines in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be eating towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it is worth some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve monitoring by the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economic Affairs, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national index of consumer prices, which is like a prelude to the sanitation of the INDIC.
It is not clear if Mrs Fernández wants to stay in politics beyond the end of her term of office, now that her husband is no longer there.
If she does, she needs to earn the support of the middle class, among which Kirchnerism is very popular.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacations in Mars, the wave of sympathy for her will reflect.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to resign, without noise, many of her husband's policies.
A half-hourra for China
Taiwanese voters are heading towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of his great brother on the other side of the road?
More than 7.5 million electors presented themselves on 27 November, or 70 per cent of eligible persons, to elect mayors and municipal advisers in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself became a substitute for the feelings of the continent, having created innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. I've managed the test, but it's all right.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) won three out of five medals, he failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which turned to Taiwan's full independence, won almost 50% of all the 45% of the votes for the KMT.
If it were a presidential vote, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, the vote of his party has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with KMT in municipal councils.
The event exposed most of the main subjects of the Taiwanese elections, including campaign trucks and mass-gathering flags with girls who danced in minimum maintenance.
An attempt to commit a mysterious murder has also been made.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of KMT, made an election tour for a KMT candidate in the wake of the election.
A man from the crowd shot at young Mr. Lien, purely through his face, hurting him and killing a passerby.
In fact, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, has had consequences on the election by leading the suspicion of the DPP and turning the voters to the KMT.
Perhaps China was the largest winner of the elections.
It was striking how far the issue of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates played with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its true independence and hates China's military threat.
Thus, KMT tends to avoid discontinuing its links with the government of Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from appreciating the anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, claimed confirmation as to whether his Chinese policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide commercial facilities, in accordance with its strategy to mourn Taiwan, from returning to the barracks.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but start at the beginning.
It is better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP was reinvented in any way.
Two years ago, he went badly: his former boss, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison for corruption charges.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a proponent for explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has seen under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP work together to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was welcomed as a candidate for the DPP to the presidency, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he can also engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for an expert panel to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their interviews could take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presented a "reliable alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to challenge the presidency.
Even without the intervention of Mr. Chen, the DPP will have trouble choosing between its potential candidates.
KMT needs to do an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's assessments have been weak; despite a vertigo economic growth, KMT's candidates did not want to campaign with him.
It seems to be largely due to unemployment and the expansion of the gap between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesperson says that his cabinet and his local antennas will be replaced.
The good results of the PDP suggested that Taiwan's support for reconciliation should be limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy Awards nominations: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
At the request of a president, people are required to know about it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer who was handcuffed by President Obama to take place at his Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, marked one of the Grammy Awards surprises this year with a large nomination in the category of "best new artist".
Considering that Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination remains a little mysterious but is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards that an artist must not exit more than three albums before recording; this "sets the artist's public identity."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given its slightly engaging voice style, its skilled hand of pop and funk and its Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one line pointed at Spalding in relation to Norah Jones' success in 2003, the closest equal for the Grammy Awards voters, taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
In addition, the Grammy Awards voters have just honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "History" in the category "instrumental album", a twist on a re-registration Frisson that was one of the main favorites last year.
Among these yesterday, "Moody 4B" of the veteran saxophoneist James Moody and "Positootly" of the keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition in particular.
Trombone Shorty, in favor of the loud voice of the New Orleans and invited to the "Treme" of HBO, has been honored in the contemporary jazz category; it is also strongly inclined to a certain fusion with the albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The secret Society of the Darky James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, has won some well-deserved awards in the large group category; in competition with the rich room-jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose "Pathways" album of his octet's live was a good example of the democratic hand of this bassist as a group leader.
Grammy Awards nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Annual Awards include a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers all over the world.
In the head of the nominations, let's quote Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machine" for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and "Dreamhouse" by Steve Mackey, an electrical orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with links to Southern California, there is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No.4, "Los Angeles", a work ordered by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in high school for a reward.
Classic appointments are divided into 13 categories covering orchestra, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the classic producer of the year includes five candidates: Blancon Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The classic album nominations are the Symphonies n°3 and 4 of Bruckner of the Royal Orchestra of Concertgebouw; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the art of the Castrati" putting together various artists; and the "Requiem" of Verdi of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the category of opera, the nominees are "Lulu" of Berg of the Royal Opera House Orchestra, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Adolf Hasse of Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" of Kaija Saariaho of the German Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" of Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and the Choir of the Theatre Mariinsky; and "Ivanhoé" of Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers that are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition include Pärt for Symphony n°4, Daugherty for "God Ex Machine", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionattot Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No.4 was first at Disney Hall in January 2009 in an execution recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of approximately 30 minutes is named "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former magnat of Mikhail Khodorkovski oil, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was appointed for its solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles said he had just written the work of 15 minutes specifically for the interpreter at the Avi Avi Avital Mandoline, who played the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it using the sounds of the Middle East and a lot of ranges and rhythms of North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The head of the orchestra Pierre Boulez, 85 years old, received a nomination in the category of orchestra benefits, leading the Symphonic Orchestra of Chicago in a recording of the works of Stravinsky.
Among the instrumental soloists who received a nomination, let's quote pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only solstice vocalists; these are Anne Sophie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classical mixtures, soprano Jesse Norman received a nomination for his recording "Ragines: my life, my song"
The Temecula Mosque project is approved by the Planning Committee.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours of public witnessing, often passionate.
Critics took part in the project, claiming that it was promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the Commissioners decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre was respecting local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many people have come to support him: Christians, Jews, Bahais, you mention him," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, taking the floor on Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of it as an American citizen."
"This shows that justice carries it."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking for or against the centre, in the short term, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper website.
"There is no more America," wrote one speaker.
"It's another single planet with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including Ground Zero, where the September 11, 2001, attacks took place in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of 135 co-existing families in the Riverside county for years but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943 square feet mosque at Mediterranean-style architecture would consist of two minarets and would rise to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a 4.32 hectares site on the Nicolas road about two miles east of the Chaparral lycee.
Opponents may still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
A microbe tolerating arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a foreign bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say that this shows that life has opportunities beyond major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has dual capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That's why she's very special, even though she's far from being a really "foreign" life form," commented Paul Davies C. W. of the University of Arizona State, co-author of the report in the online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacteria discovered in Lake Mono, California, is able to continue to develop after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"We are wondering what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of the University of Arizona State, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in life research beyond Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the find, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could reveal the discovery of an alien life.
That wasn't the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other global environments, organisms could be able to use other elements to act on biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute of Planetary and Space Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a lucky discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Astrology Institute, which conducted the study, chose Lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, it has speculated that one microbe exposed to both substances could be able to replace one another.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, the organizations have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately."
"But arsenic is different enough so it doesn't work exactly like phosphorus; it penetrates inside and, in some ways, rubbers the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
Researchers have collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing levels of arsenic to which it could adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic can naturally occur, either on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, deputy professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but it never showed that it could work.
The arsenic was more common at the beginning of the existence of the Earth, she said; thus, the researchers issued the hypothesis that the first forms of life could have used it.
This suggests that there may be other ways to train life, not only the way life on Earth was trained at the beginning," said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
Research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two dogs of stolen exposure were found in Compton
The other two dogs at the exhibition on four thefts outside a motel in Bellflower were found, the sheriffs of the Los Angeles County announced it on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two axatas and two galois pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express truck in which they spent the night outside a motel 6 of Belllower, announced the authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found at the end of the Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, the spokesperson of the department of the sheriff of the county of Los Angeles.
"The good news is that dogs are going well," says Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs had been found, what neighborhood and what were the circumstances of their discovery.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't want to say that," Whitmore said.
"We follow the orders."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were unable to join to provide a comment on Thursday.
They were gathered on Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a shelter for animals of the county located in Downey.
The sheriff's agents found the truck and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were healthy and excepted, announced the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the choirs that Rickard and Peek planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were taken away until their discovery Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the National Championship "AKC/Eukakuba" of Long Beach, where they were supposed to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other trials scheduled in the days preceding the exhibition "AKC/Eukakuba", Peek said in the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops of the canine exhibition tour of nearly one month of the couple.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in the motels and get their van outside, right next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a boxer chiot, a Parson Russell territory and a Breton Spaniard - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the basket, to the thicker fur, in the truck where it would be cooler.
They have a little open windows so dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the flight of the truck at 6 o'clock on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corps, with a micropile implanted to identify them.
It is not clear if a reward has been granted on Thursday.
The lion is ready to redecorate again, the restructuring of MGM is only waiting for the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally obtained the green light to start again at zero.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially rented the "pre-packaged" plan on Thursday by creditors that about $5 billion of debt would be eliminated; opening the way to the entertainment company, having been 86 years of existence, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television broadcasts.
With Thursday's decision, according to which the plan meets the requirements of the US bankruptcy code, there is no legal obstacle to MGM to surrender to fleets under the supervision of the Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum entertainment founders, who will become the general directors of what will be an alleviated studio.
Staff will be brought back to approximately 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not really emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has completed a $500 million credit facility, which is intended to finance new MGM operations and productions.
It is currently licensed by the investment bank, which itself accounts for $75 million, and should be financed by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009 when the Investment Bank Moelis & Co. was committed to advise management on how to place its finances, since it did not have the means to pay interest of $300 million a year.
In August, the Director General, Harry Sloan, was replaced by Stephen Cooper, an ex-PDG of Enron, and a re-known expert for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and satisfy the more than 140 studio creditors took much more time than planned.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed at the end of 2009 to put the company on sale.
However, the sales to auctions attracted few bidders, none of whom were ready to pay the amount of 2 billion more of which creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be repeated when the MGM team had started working on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal disagreements and debates, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive multi-million-dollar premiums for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already earned $1.2 million, will receive a $9.5 million payment.
Cooper companies, which have collected $375 000 per month for their business management services, will receive a $4 million "success premium".
Barber and Birnbaum are looking to relaunch the production of MGM, which has only released one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films that would come out from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit", with Warner Bros
The studio must conclude a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which must be made by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who holds approximately 18% of MGM's debt, attempted to make a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies did not lead to an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your budget balanced
Although the main candidate for this year's most wonderful play is the IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make an important break in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes at $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 strings to jump classic beads, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your budget balanced.
Recently, I visited three national toy salesmen - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wolesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, this year's technological toy is likely to have more strength; yet, the same price is less than the same price, compared to the last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most famous of these, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button stack toys are increasing, as well as rechargeable stack toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, except if otherwise indicated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and over) are pulsating toys of the size of an Indian coyote that sings a note when you press them on their belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second allows a song to be composed.
If you buy more, they'll sing in harmony.
Warning: once you start to support, you can no longer stop.
To combine the song with the dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and more) is the best choice.
Inspired by Elmo Live's technology last year, the 14-inch animated doll plays role-playing games like Simon Says and can make the moon dance thanks to its innovative feet with wheel-blocking.
Children who tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and more), with a backpack full of quiz cards designed to turn a car balloon into a session with a self-correction and a van classer.
If you are suspicious when your child keeps your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for 3-8 years) is the least expensive and easier to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not effectively educate as the Leafster Explorer ($70, for 3-12 years), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for 3-7 years) uses an iTunes type system to offer games and electronic books and has an entry for SD card that allows you to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and over) is a set of five blocks with no more than one lamp box, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before the time runs out, it is ideal for an impromptu orthography competition.
More and more, toys have a kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toys shops, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet from the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix'N Match Figure Pack, $5 for 6 to 12 years) which includes a marked piece of a hidden code.
When you buy the online code, your child receives enough credit from the club Penguin store for two items to choose from.
It can be a wheelchair or a pet toy puffle.
slightly bigger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the last micro-bots with stack button.
The beastly false moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It's fun to make a labyrinth of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It's also solid.
Ours has resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage in the mouth of our dog.
Bringing a softer side to maintaining order in China
Tang Shenbin held a seat in the city as a urban sergeant in training by carefully inspecting his nervous duties, issuing low-voice orders with a military authority.
He wanted female Chenguan members - who were in charge of the public order in China, who were afraid and despised for their arbitrary repression and who were fighting for violence - to convey a certain impression to a group of spectators.
"You're right!"
"Be strong!"
Show them, he says, "What do beautiful girls look like?"
Four girls who had barely passed adolescence in white gloves, clothing and identical olive-colored pants, were looking at you.
Four pairs of black toe shoes, aligned to the rule.
Four well-trained hats perfectly pierced to the top of hair attached by a reddish, blue and white knot.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, in a hurry.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city demanded that all new recruits have a higher degree of study.
The province of Guangdong has exchanged the grey-green uniforms against a so-called more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced their eyes in a strong way:: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack car with black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the co-porteur re-runs his affairs and parts.
Xindu, a city district of 680,000 people in Chengdu, has chosen to perform a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in the urban environment of 13 women, especially chosen for their appearance, age and age.
The idea is to give the degrossian police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson might have difficulty drawing the attention to this underground urban brigade of China.
And because of that, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media show news of a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the province of Hubei beat an observer to death after using his mobile phone to film a protest against a discharge of waste.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing's inspectors, decommissioned and online, describes how he effectively beats offenders without issuing blood.
This year in Shanghai, a Pasteur was abandoned with a brain injury after a bakery with five officers.
A video game featuring violence, available by online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained to attack street vendors.
"Chenguan marked the government," said China Daily last year, a national publication, after a single discussion on tactics.
The newspaper called for a "real complete cleaning."
The skeptics say the approach is far away.
After the district went through an announcement in October to find eight new women's recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had real jobs or whether they were just a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a little bit of the two.
The district's announcement required women's candidates, aged 18 to 22, to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five faces in the right order."
They must have a size greater than the average, either 1.6 metres or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
The 26-year retirement is mandatory.
Officers said that work was physically too painful for women over 25 years of age.
"It's their image that's important," said a certain district officer at Rednet.com, a nearly governmental website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they agree; it is about the size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament and the "internal qualities."
Chengguan's women are like flower vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that the requirements for height were the standard standard in many Chinese employment offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the order of the face.
What that means is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, persons with disabilities or disabilities are not required to post.
"We can't let a person who's boxing or a boss come here," said Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrols the place Baoguang near a monastery, is 22 years old and has the pummeled games with a finely curved mouth.
She did not consider the enhancement of her appearance as a sexist, she said.
"Do you think I'm sexy in this uniform?" she asked for a dissatisfaction.
Xu Yang, his colleague at the 21-year-old fossils, says, "Our work is to present the image of the city."
They do not object to their mandate being limited, they say, because they feed more career ambitions than simply chase sellers into the streets where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen ambulances that move quickly by foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as little bread or tofu bags as possible before taking the escape.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
"We've already told you twice!" said Mrs. Xu, while a seller was on foot, temporarily leaving his bike-cartret with novels.
Agents describe their functions as singletons rather than burns.
"It's almost the same thing every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who is studying post-work marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the goods of the sellers.
They can only threaten to alert the offenders to their superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exposure of animity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rebelled after spreading false rumors that Chengguan agents had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen policemen and ganggans were injured, 14 government vehicles were turned upside down or fired.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is not quite guaranteed.
Just two parcels of flat place Baoguang houses, where female officers patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
Agents confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as the regulations imposed on them.
The owner of the motorcycle created the scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the police, on the left-hand face, broke down a road to their vehicle and left at any speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years old, a co-ordinator attached to the male team, remained behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female sex officers, coordinators - 40-year-olds or older - play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a hidden image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li of yours.
"Most of the time, it's the audience that starts."
Prosecutors will not blame Senator Ensign
Prosecutors of the Department of Justice have raised criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, resulting from a case related to an assistant of an old campaign and his efforts to obtain a lobbying job for the wife's husband, announced the senator's lawyers on Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Republican of Nevada, who was considered a potential Republican candidate for the 2012 presidency until the scandal surrounding his case did not make the major national titles last year and undermine his career.
Mr. Ensign's office stated that he was "very happy" with the decision, as a result of a one-year survey.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers stated that the Department of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he did not intend to maintain any accusation against him in this case."
The Ministry of Justice abstained from commenting on this matter.
The announcement came as a kind of surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice, according to which there would have been significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign would have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first reported in October 2009 at the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain a lucrative lobbying job to gain the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the Senator's case with her.
Mrs. Hampton once served as a treasurer during a Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then he defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; according to documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was banned for a year by the law to lobbyize his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems to contradict the said ban on lobbying.
According to the evidence made public, "there seems to be a primal evidence of a plot to violate and substantially violate the law of the rotating door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients from a government investigation.
Although the Department's judge refused to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the Department seemed to object to political prosecutions after a number of high-level appeals lodged by its public integrity section, including the decisions last year to abandon prosecutions against former Senator Ted Stevens charged with misconduct of prosecution.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid of taking up arms, Melanie Sloan, the Civilian Director General for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group of defences that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief lawyer of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a telephone call on Monday from a prosecutor of the Ministry of Justice and a follow-up the following day, saying that the department was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's team of lawyers had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to convince them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed him in a communiqué on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to state the legal arguments he had made in the prosecution.
"I am not able to enter into the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to abandon an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, claiming that the payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to Hampton violated the federal electoral law.
The electoral commission stated that it did not have enough evidence to prove that money was all but a gift.
NV Energy, an important Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find the lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after receiving Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he "martela" the Ministry of the Interior on an issue in dispute.
Mr. Ensign also participated in a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another customer of Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the transport secretary to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had engaged Mr. Hampton in lobbying.
When news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his electors and resigned from his position as leader of the fourth republican rank in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago that he intended to hold a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator hoped that the Ethics Committee would quickly follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and put an end to his investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire's call points to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were in the middle of the auditorium.
They were sending all the minutes of the horrendous witness reports on Twitter.
Finally, the defence said that there were more than 140,000 messages on the case of rape and children attached to their bed in a house that was burned.
On Thursday, the trial followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was found guilty of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, should lead to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence to the court that is missing an appeal, which is likely to occupy the courts for years.
What is causing is that intense reports on the trial - as well as widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists - have created a "circuit atmosphere", a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with fire details that the jury has been badly influenced by the public's passions.
The application could lead judges to debate the question of whether new technologies require new rules in the hearing rooms.
"I have experienced this during this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the hearing rooms is a violation of the rights of the person to an equitable trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer of Mr Hayes, lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleue of the Supreme Court of State, has therefore rejected the claims in the trial made last week, claiming that the media were "well controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury would have been encouraged by passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the issue.
The appeal courses have been recognizing for decades that the media coverage of known cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 judgment that took place, the Supreme Court of the United States annulled the conviction of a Cleveland osteopathy, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, claiming in his decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere in the trial " because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for television and the movie "The Fleet".
Some lawyers have stated that the appeals courts seized to review Mr. Hayes' conviction a half century later may be curious given the argument that new rules might be necessary to manage the means of communication of the hearing rooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of the new media," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford's Law School who studied the death penalty at Connecticut and wrote a report that she was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue said that some appeals judges might be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of the instantaneous communication from the hearing rooms could allow for a fairer trial.
The case of Twitter is just one of many other descriptions by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, who can be discussed for years, which delays execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered an injury when the Blue Judge refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jury members by showing them macabre pictures of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some of the jury stated that he was terrified by the victims' photos, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and his daughters, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old.
The defence lawyers claim that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unjustly expelled one of the jury, who had been critical of the prosecutors, and that he has abused the pressure on a verdict by making the unusual decision to bring the jury to discuss in a week-end.
The jury was not kidnapped.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a dispute against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by the candidates at the Governor's position and the United States Senate.
They maintained that the computer media continued to attack the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The daily tweeting of media, cameras and journalists in front of the court," the lawyers wrote, "was nothing like what was seen here in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level."
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the statement that the new instantaneouss were more fire-fighting than those reported more slowly was a ludicrous view that would support the Court's policy governing the media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said that appeals were often attracted by the arguments that social and technological changes required an adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they refer to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 that had reversed Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the media coverage of the trial and they stated that they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, represents Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century. "
Can civility approach the creeks?
After a campaign marked by invectiveness and negativity, a minimum of civility broke out in Washington this week.
Is this a sign of genuine bilateral cooperation in advance or an illusory moment before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and the leaders of Congress did not produce any insight into the major issues that must be addressed during the session of the "box canard".
But of course, there was at least a polar discussion about the differences between the two parties and the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to mark points.
The Commission's public meeting on Wednesday on the President's deficit was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect over the ideological gap; however, it still divides the members.
It is hardly enough to state that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both parties are now in a time of trial and mutual trial to obtain signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the electorate's patience for a renewed partisan war.
That is why the Tuesday meeting and the subsequent comments of the participants revealed a minimum of demands or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether tax, expenditure, health care or rights, both parties remain thousands of miles away.
However, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed on tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now next to the Centre for Ethics and Public Policy.
"It's inevitable after the elections.
Elections give rise to partisan passions and then they get worse.
It's okay."
On certain issues, including those on the agenda of the "boxed canard" session, the Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of that.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve a part or a whole, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment allowances, only because the Republicans cannot afford to give themselves the impression that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, while refusing unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimism is planned on a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "box canard", with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston, from the Brookings Institute, warns that a fruitful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the Lame Duck session will not necessarily lead to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he said, a period of disagreement is likely, even inevitable.
"When things have to be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civilization would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what is happening between today and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow boxing compared to the 2012 main event, he said.
The reasons are closely linked to the composition of the new republican majority in the House and the voters present in the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to be aware of their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new Health Care Act.
These partisan positions are now and are already clear in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit committee which include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, rejecting the retirement age and reducing expenditure.
Co-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington, and they themselves have imposed the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes to the Commission, composed of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have had trouble reaching that number.
The largest resistance remains among the group's electors, suggesting that there are at least some reasons for or willingness to compromise on tax matters today.
Galston foresees two phases in the struggle between the White House and the Republicans of Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partial confrontations, given that the Republicans contest Obama with regard to budgets, taxes and health care, and will then be followed by a greater period of bilateral cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
Public opinion.
It is widely proven that, despite the partial spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see both parties working together.
If confrontation leads to impasse, as in 1995, then both parties will closely observe the public's response.
The person who will be judged to be lost will have to change his mind and find compromises.
However, this would be an optimistic point of view.
Partisan spirit and polarization are now larger than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of Congress than there were then between President Bill Clinton and Republicans.
At the same time, the militants of the two parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more consequent election in 2012.
In view of this reality, the civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on the part of both sides to find a framework of understanding on the issues that still divide them.
US documents released describe Moscow as a source of corruption
The city's control is between the hands of a "Kleptocratie" and makes it pass to Kremlin some of the wine pots and the protection money it collects, reported the US Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service carry out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of life in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical power" - takes part while the money is heading up the scale.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyle, was posted on Wednesday by Wikileaks on his website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been cleared.
She was written while Yuri Loujkov was still Major of Moscow; and he is largely responsible for corruption.
He was released in October by President Dmitri Medvedev, but since then there have been few cleaning traces.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a first-rate construction company, have always denied corruption charges over the years; and he has won several defamation trials on these charges.
In September, he stated what follows on a Russian television channel, when he was interrogated on a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's throwing, it's anything."
The Russians believe, to an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to the polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in an embassy account; and it is strange to imagine that it would be for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to call it "disfunctional" and to affirm that the government acted more like a kleptocracy than a government," according to the ambassador's note.
"The criminal elements enjoy a " krisha " (the term used in the criminal world/mafia that literally means " roof " or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"The analysts identify a three-level structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are at the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a gap in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB spends the money of the largest companies and that the police target the small ones.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow's business owners understood that it was preferable to obtain protection from the MVD and the FSB (as opposed to organized crime groups) because, not only, they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but they are also protected by law."
"That's why the application for protection by criminal gangs is no longer as high."
The note indicates that, although the collection of money is extended, protection itself may be unequal; even those who pay are sometimes under arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their business close under a pretext or another.
Medvedev mentioned several times the fight against corruption, but he admitted little progress.
The embassy's note transmits income accounts to men who bring suitcases, probably full of money, to Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev is dependent on bureaucrats," said in a recent interview with Gueorgui Satarov, director of the "think tank Indem" in Moscow.
"But he is part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a political class because it does not exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to India, the cost of corruption would be over $300 billion a year across Russia.
The country was classified 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are classified at least as corrupt).
The disclosure of the note by the US Embassy, which had only been made yesterday, late in the evening in Moscow time, will certainly remove the discontent within the Russian government; although Loujkov may be blamed, to some extent, for the failure of Moscow, this could be an opportunity for Kremlin to show that he is dealing with the problem.
Interviewed by the CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks' documents could be a manufacturing and responded in anger to the reports that US diplomats had released by calling Batman and approaching Medvedev from Robin.
"The problem is based on the fact that this is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country, he said.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that this would be done with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, contrary to ethics."
The former Khmer fighters forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with low-quality concrete walls, Anlong Veng's high school director mentioned the man who built it, the last head of the Red Khmers, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves your mok."
"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the mouth" for its brutality, when he was at the head of the Red Khmers, this commander remains popular in this isolated base of former Khmer Reds in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures; and where thousands of former troops of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers returned to the government, long-term loyalty was finally challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation enabled victims to face those who had participated in the regime in public.
In June, the government distributed a high-school manual that, for the first time, teaches the Red Khmer history to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly directed with the United Nations, issued its first judgement on a former Khmer member of the Red, condemning, at 35 years of imprisonment, the former head of the sadistically famous torture centre of Tuol Slang, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch".
In the face of this change in the situation, anxiety has increased among the former fighting Khmer Reds in Anlong Veng, which complicates reconciliation efforts and their will to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There are feelings and fear among the old Khmers red but they are powerless to do whatever it is," Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, said an independent agency that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Khmers was glorious, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
Under the rule of the Khmer Red in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overcrowding.
When the Vietnamese invaded and reversed the government of Pol Pot-United in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements took place in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led their base in the western Cambodia mountains and in the jungle, Ta Mok prepared a suite at Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a United Nations-led peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Red Khmer fighters began to deteriorate to the government, culminating in the capitals of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had taken the lead, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 awaiting trial.
Without their benefits, most of the former Red Khmer fighters were in black misery, common to the rural areas of Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic in the movement.
Although some red Khmer elite officers have kept their positions as local leaders in exchange for having deposited the weapons, they are unqualified farmers in the low grade and file.
"These people received very little follow-up after the surrender," said Sok Lang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are imbibed of the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
"They have been raised in a framework where business is a foreign concept."
Sir Lim, 55 years old, who joined the Khmer Red as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before installing in 1998 as a poor farmer of rice.
"Life under the Red Khmers was good," he said.
"It's Mok feeding everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to meet our own needs."
The current Khmer Red Court has also raised concerns here.
The court should, at the beginning of next year, begin the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former red Khmer minister.
The mandate of the court is to judge the high-level leaders and the main perpetrators of the crimes, but he did not say whether he continued beyond those four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculations turned to Im Chaem, 64-year-old, former district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the rule of the Red Khmers in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced workers would have been killed.
Recently, during a torrid evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the field near his wooden house on pilots, on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
While the sun casts long shadows on the thirsty grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the Khmer Reds.
If the court called her, she said she would refuse to go.
"Cambodge is in peace and stability," she said.
"If there is more persecution, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who failed the Red Khmers in 1978, also warned on several occasions that instability would occur if the court continued several suspects; although experts and historians object.
"Cambodge must cross a hole and bury the past, he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia must do to get ahead, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation center.
"The reconciliation in terms of khmer is to recognize the broken pieces, he says.
"We must put these pieces together so that we can understand."
The centre produced the first manual approved by the Government on the Red Khmers, "A history of the Democratic Kampuchea, consisting of 75 pages."
He distributed it in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history manuals of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Red.
As in most Cambodia, Anlong Veng's young people know only a few details about the Khmer Reds, despite the city's links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new manual helped students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents responded with skepticism when he returned with the book to the house to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he says.
"They doubt because they don't know exactly how many people the court will pursue."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Lang said.
But the public forums, the manual and the court begin to have an impact, he said.
However, the Khmer Red maintains a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the mountains of Dangreek, a path, invaded by the bad grasses and patched plastic bags, leads to a black gray rectangle, covered with a rolled table roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Noum Sothea, aged 31, a mobile phone vendor on the road, said she didn't know much about the man who was incinerated in this place.
"But he has a great spirit; and many people go there to pray," she said.
It was the anniversary of Noum Sothea and later that day she planned to go to the last place of rest of Pol Pot where she would leave a bunch of mural bananas in the hope of bringing the chance.
Belarus accepts to renounce its military uranium stock
The government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it would abandon its highly enriched uranium stock, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decade is part of a surprising victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide
The agreement was published in a joint communiqué published after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Sergei Martynov, on the edge of a security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have left the horizon in the last spring.
But U.S. officials told Washington Post that certain classified operations have been carried out with Belarus in the last two months to eliminate 187 pounds of military uranium from a Belarus research centre.
This opened the way for a Wednesday agreement to eliminate the remainder of the matter of about 500 pounds, according to an official who referred to the condition of the anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, organized at the Obama initiative, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was beneficial to extend an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
"I am really fascinated that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit.
"This proves to me that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a nuclear safety promotion group.
Clinton qualified the "very significant, important step" agreement made by Belarus.
Obama committed himself in Prague in April 2009 to secure all nuclear materials that are vulnerable throughout the world in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have made it under George W. Bush's administration.
At the Obama Nuclear Safety Summit, Belarusian President Alexandre Loukachenko said the nation would never renounce its uranium.
"We have kept high-rich uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military-quality uranium and low-rich uranium," said Mr. Loukachenko.
"It's our product... we're not going to make salt bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We're going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus approached the United States a few months ago; however, expressing an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate the uranium in Belarus, in October, was particularly complicated because the material had been slightly irradiated, reported to be responsible.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to an installation in Russia to be stored and disposed of, reported the officials.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by aircraft, according to the managers.
The US government has spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus' research facilities with low-rich uranium; inadequate for weapons.
"A small-scale coordination and organization have been implemented to strengthen confidence", leading to Clinton's agreement, Andrew Bieniawski, a head of the Department of Energy Specialized in the Reduction of World Menace, said.
According to estimates from the Study Centre of Non-Proliferation James Martin, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus seeks to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
The relationship between Belarus and the United States has been strained for years, mainly due to the harsh repression by Loukachenko of Human Rights.
But Wednesday's statement would suggest a potential renewal.
"All by welcoming progress on these issues of global security, the United States and Belarus recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential to improving bilateral relations; and essential to the country's and its citizens' progress," she said.
The government has not issued any objection to CIA flights
The government did not object to the CIA's flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners in the direction of Guantanamo across the Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the US ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks to the daily El País, which add that the first vice-president of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they were adequately overseeing foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe, which charged with complicity in practices contrary to human rights to dozens of countries, including Spain, there was a meeting between former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-Chairman acknowledged that the Council's report "was surprised by Zapatero's out-of-game Government" and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide.
"From the Vega he stressed that Spain has no objection with regard to intelligence flights over the Spanish territory."
"They only want to be informed" to prevent them from being "taken away," Aguirre reports in a cable.
The holder of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "was willing to give this case the lowest possible profile, even though, as she was in the hands of the judges, the Government had limited influence".
In turn, in January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Department of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no criminal elements, no sensitive information," the Embassy explained after speaking to the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless expressed concern about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for the declassified information of the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination among independent investigators will complicate our efforts to conduct the case discreetly among Governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007 during a lunch between the US Ambassador and the Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even though Spanish judges are jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments from a heated rhetoric, trying to reduce the temperature."
The Ambassador also expresses concern about the PP's action in this case.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," it reported.
The Pariside that passed on to the blind complained on the network of the "accomplishment" of being a mother
The young girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terreur to Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she used as soon as she was little, she communicated with a cousin and at least one friend; the two origins of Noia, the village of the Coruña whose origin she was.
The messages date from 2008.
To hear them, we need to know his sentimental life, which ABC builds with the help of his parents' testimony.
The 30-year-old Galician girl started a relationship with Iván Túñez in 1998.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they separated, we knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was with him, but his ex never let him take the DNA test.
We found another new little friend shortly after that.
He was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring town.
With him, she lived for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the young girl went to the Balearic Islands to explore the labour market, the boy stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But according to the content of its communications, it is understood that their idyllic has broken, they have separated.
In March 2008 she is in Minorque alone, and writes: "Alberto is very strange and old because I came to work there."
"When I told him, it gave him a good thing, but of course, he now takes into account what it means to be with the child all day long and not have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then she's talking about a cell phone message she just got: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you the child."
She complains, "If she doesn't like it, leave the boy with my mother, and I'll take it when I get back," she says.
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I am leaving, but I will only stay there until 19, because the 20 I have to present myself to a job so I don't lose it."
She explains that if everything was all right, she would have taken her old man with her.
"He will stay with the right person, that is to say with me, and I will never let him live with another person if that person is not my mother," dubious intent, taking into account their bad relationships.
In July, there's another post.
When she tapped it, it was assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of this month, and he had allegedly been murdered on the 10th was dead.
"César is happy on the one hand, but he's not on the other."
"On one side he's with me and this place he likes a little, but on the other, he goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a move to Majorca.
"There will be (the child) in a few hours of summer and so I save some money from the baby-sitter."
17. Greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss on Caesar's side, who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know which video to email, you see, when he wants it, he finds me, shit."
The 30th, another: "The child is well, he goes to summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Victor, his current partner, there's one: "I'm getting ahead of money."
She has messages on the Internet in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the liberator of the prison."
"Terreur a la Galician (epigrapher) " .
The last man who lived with her, watchful, expresses his regret to feel guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything was going on because she didn't tell him that she was a single mother.
Monica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma yesterday, from the juvenile detention center in Minorque.
Lawyer Carlos Maceda explained that she did not remember how the facts had happened, "and she had no intention of harming the minor."
Before she had confessed to have drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited her body in a suitcase.
The defence and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric trial.
The members of the People's Party would gain 4 seats in Congress and the PSC will lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and MPs recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more positive, because the number of votes that this training receives in these double commissions is normally what it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the Catalan people received 610,473 votes in general in 2008, while in the 2006 autonomys they received 316.2222.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend was maintained, which was desired by a vote diversion of the PSC and the engagement of the PP electorate, the analysts of this training calculated that, if there were general elections, the PSC could pass from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CIU would also win four (now 10) and PSC would lose no more than 9 MPs (at 25).
These calculations would indicate that the Catalan place is fundamental to PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, the ERC would lose a Member - he has three now - while ICV would keep a Member or win one.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for municipal commissions, where the people can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four capitals of the province and in their relations with the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the highest budget - EUR 661 million for 2011.
Nationalists as well as popular people agree that the PSC could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists would no longer have the opportunity to use their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking account of the republican debacle, it would not be fantastic if this training would lose its representation in Barcelona's mayor - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, whose mayor, Angel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
Populars have also recorded progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports in Al Qaida
In addition to the seven prisoners in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian officers of the Barcelona Police Information Office formed a jihadist cell that, led from Thailand, provided passports to various groups of Al Qaida, including "Tigres for the Liberation of Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Tiba" (Let), the last author of the Bombay attacks that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has given great importance to these investigations, in order to ensure that "the Kampai operation" has been "debilit" the Al Qaida counterfeiting device at international level and therefore "its operational capacity".
Researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years during which it was active in Catalonia, could send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that would integrate the criminal galaxy Al Qaida so that its "combatants" could cross the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The decommissioned cell is the only one that the jihadist network was operating in Europe, which is why other European police units participated in the investigations, except for Thai services, so in the territory of the European Union there could be the following days of similar beatings on the night of Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (retained by Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Ashhar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatounde Agunbiade), another was carried out in Thailand, with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Siriklaya Kijbumrung.
They were those who ran the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - which was hit by a party in 2009 - mainly flew from tourists the passports that met the conditions of the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is to say, the documents were to be on behalf of young men aged 25 to 45 with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
The investigators point out that so far no details have been found that connect the detainees in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, even though the author of this attack, "Laskar e Tiba", was one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that a few days before the attack was committed, a shipment agency of a few thousand dollars that was "invested" to purchase mobile cards that were used after the integrators of the "commando" that killed 106 people was sent from Catalonia.
The police have come up with a lot of documentation.
PP requests Mas to suspend tax complicity
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity to personally present to Arthur Mas his conditions to support his investment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign, and which sum up giving priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereignist adventures such as the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wants to address half of his mandate.
The President of the Catalan Peoples came to the meeting with Arthur Mas with the assurance that he had obtained 18 MPs last Sunday, a number more than enough to love himself, as the CIU candidate requires that at least one of the trainings that the opposition will take place in the polling of the investment.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists wish to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but, for the time being, the conversations that Mas has today with the rest of the political leaders are being held as a Catalan key.
And with regard to the President of the PP, to support an investment "it would be necessary to eliminate all sovereign and independent speeches", and economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque country - that the convergent leader wishes to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders share their share of increasing the political apparatus of a very excessive autonomous administration and eliminating the tax applied to inheritances and donations.
Details of the Mas's investment negotiations will take care of the PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercos (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citudadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the deaths were not due to the "lack of measures"
Owners of the center of Olot do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
Journalists La Caritat d'Olot (Gérone) presented a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people he was responsible for at the time he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was accompanied by the Centre's lawyer, Joan Cáñada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be the one to be able to carry out the charge against the responsible" for the dead, but "legality and responsibility force us to take over the procedural situation of civil officials".
And apart from the social discreditation that the entity may suffer because it has not detected the criminal activities of the night nurse, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of an important compensation that legal representatives of the victims' parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime was in August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing.
The judge mentioned in the judgment that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatrics - which he suspected in many cases that no doctor would personally explore the deaths but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality had taken place by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures could at no time have been the cause of what happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in this case there is only one indication of impudence on the part of any other person who is not charged".
The person who was already baptized as the "Ange de la Mort" confessed 11 murders earlier and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused his death by injecting an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mixture of sedative pills.
The Director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control the access of medical staff from the centre.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her desire to alleviate internal suffering, used to kill them.
But laboratory analyses will clarify if Vila does not lie in saying that he has sought for his first victims a less cruel death or, on the contrary, burned them inside by giving them as he already knew he had done with the three women he killed in the 12-17 October period.
The Caritat does not believe the statements made by the nurse at night, nor the number of murders committed, they do not eliminate the possibility of the number being greater and justify their attitude by the various versions Vila made in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way of killing after successfully committing eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
The investors reacted suddenly yesterday to the Trichet yesterday's threat that "the markets should not underestimate our reaction capacity."
Peripheral differences have been forced, and the European Bank's shares have increased by more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to cheat and the euro has barely recorded an in crease, which is an interesting signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that, in the same way as it collapses, it recovers, but is motivated by closes of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will be late in losing fear.
A month ago, the ECB called us today to withdraw liquidity measures and we will have to retire for the fourth time in two years and those remaining.
The Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all outstanding long-term liquidity measures, leaving only unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures will be extended "at least until March" and will maintain the sale of quarterly unlimited access auctions at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity by at least the month of June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase program and that we will even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent response of yesterday's markets and if they continue blind to withdraw the liquidity measures, which God helps us!
Just as during their May meeting, in which they claimed that they had not even considered the purchase of bonds and that they had crashed the markets, the story could happen again tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Today, one year of treatment in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28 per cent compared to 750 million to 4.81 per cent of the previous audit.
Even so, the types in Portugal dropped 30 base points across the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
The figures of the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole were published in Ireland.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potentials and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are acceptable in the Assistance Plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it still does not have sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in an uncertain home.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of his speech to relieve the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest of the Hymne of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of action approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Reform of pensions, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, reduction of deficits, liberalization, privatisation, measures to re-activate employment sound like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange amounted to 4.5%, double to the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the response of the Government and the Bank of Spain was rapid and radical and we benefited from the surprise effect.
Today there is a three-year commitment that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that this will be resolved with a strong demand and help to dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to request a Assistance Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million available in cash, the triple compared to March, to very expensive types and they cut off access to healthy markets.
However, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "beyond being, show him".
Courage, we can get out of here!
The President of Eulen will challenge the council of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm does not stop in the open conflict within the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will challenge him because he considers him to be "no right", the next 16, asked by five of his seven sons in which they will try to make their majority claim and take over the management bodies of the firm owner of Bodega Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for the control of a part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding business services for companies does not appear to be willing to surrender in his dispute to be present in the management bodies of El Enebro.
The Board of Directors has been excluded by five of its seven sons who have been appointed administrators at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January this year whose dispute is registered in the Register of Commerce and Societies.
El Enebro's judicial board for the next 16th, convened by the Magistrate Commercial No. 2 of Madrid, reopened the tonnerres box within the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to set up the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Álvarez as a "desperate appeal from the applicants' five sons to try, through a procedural argument, by clearly violating the Law and by abuse of the right, to validate and correct the assembly radically null on 18 January", according to his official spokesman.
This argument will be the basis for the fact that, once the assembly has taken place, it will be challenged, considering that it is "no full right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully for the magistrate to convene an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a company owned by Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the group of services, however, uses it over 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This case is the substantive question that the judge must decide after hearing the application for which there is not yet a reported date.
Red Bull triumph in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software creates improvements to real-time cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, his history in this selected universe of speed was marked by surprise and by success.
In the first moment, no one took into account the options of a new hurdle that had just arrived, despite the uphill trail of the last season, last November, in the last phase of the championship they all played on the Ferrari triumph of Fernando Alonso.
Without diminishing the skill as a champion driver, German Sebastian Vette, no longer the ability of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 we talk about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the Siemens multinational company has put into the hands of Red Bull to transform it into a winning team.
This is in fact a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very far-reaching goals of high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool was used to create assembly chains for factories worldwide, power stations, high precision tools.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding the possible defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of photo equipment from Canon, Sukhoi planes or the most famous Nissan utility vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the Siemens Industrial Division, explains that the use of this computer tool in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to create and run "in short hours, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements detected during the races and trials.
Russwurm explains that in 1992 there was an average of 10 technicians in their teams capable of introducing a maximum of three or four vehicle improvements each season.
In the Red Bull team today, 180 young high-quality professionals are working who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and design any kind of changes on the bolides.
The leader of Siemens explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull's balls except the engine, which is the sole responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are amended.
Changes can shift from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this film of technological development, there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has installed the high-tech plant to create and produce its bolids in a locality 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are limited.
All that goes down there is considered "top secret".
Staff for this duty count 580 people, including two pilots, the Vettel and Mark Webber champion.
The hero of Red Bull Formula 1 is undoubtedly the recent Sebastian Vetell champion.
Among the vast technological resources that the energy beverage brand has put into service for its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and zero notoriety.
The manufacturer's technology director, Steve Nevey, said five years ago that R+D's progress in racing cars was 50% of the win and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology accounts for 85% of the success, while drivers bring 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computers, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 own stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened his first exclusive shop in Barcelona in collaboration with his associate Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 trades between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-market centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte English.
The Vice-President of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the remán store located on the Grand Via de Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she worked 30 years ago.
The North American Group has prepared a plan to deploy 200 brand points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish institutions.
The first openings were those in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the one in Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible shops, even though she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
HM's management of personal systems has ensured that the philosophy for the implantation of shops will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American Group advises and takes care of the design of the exclusive furniture of shops (with products that can be affected in an interactive way), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the institutions.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a system of franchise and stressed that the exclusive network of trades claims "to improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in the purchase, assistance, post-sale and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a global pilot program that solves the potential problems of HP computer equipment in guarantee.
An online service is connected to a technical centre located in Maastricht, Holland.
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets on fly a million customers to its rivers in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell's deputy administrator, Jaime Guardiola, thinks 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
In spite of this, it foresees a collapse of the margins of interest, which will be tried to compensate partially with the increase in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years a million private customers, its task to perform.
Sabadell has found a way to operate over the next three years and can survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will launch a new management plan in 2011 which will hold a three-year maturity gap.
The objective, apart from surviving without the need to use FROB's public subsidies, is to gain a market share through the capture of a million new special customers - 700,000 if those who can get out of the bank - is to carry out its major task, as so far this bank has damaged more SMEs and companies than the particular client.
This year he has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5 per cent, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity balance, or the same thing, austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks are now reluctant to set goals and make them public, as the financial crisis has disturbed all the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalise his Optima Director's plan this year, established four years ago, although initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for an additional period.
Customers who leave savings boxes will be their main target.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "hard and transcendental year".
The executive, in fact, thinks that the exit of the crisis in Spain will be "slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking case, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the passive war - which penalizes margins - is reduced, the price of risk premiums that banks and cash pay for its emissions to obtain liquidity is already moving at the credit price to compensate for the loss of margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and funding is structural and will be a pressure on credit."
"We haven't closed the tap, but the differences are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already ordered his network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differences - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the banking sector's trend now "is to increase the commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's management plan is based on organic growth even though, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he ensures that in Spain "we will ask for larger dimensions."
"Everything will move next year," he said.
He argues that capital needs "extremely increase" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
It also notes that FROB can replace the market in the collection of funds in the case of new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, he has reduced the importance of some banks already predicting as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, it is possible to obtain short-term funding through rest, which reduces the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers between the cash registers
The ECSC Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a new wave of savings cash mergers and insisted again on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the Spanish savings funds concentration process began, there were several entities that ensured that they were not going to participate in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Caisse d'épargnes (ECCA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think that most of the mergers have been realized, it cannot be said that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most of them have been fully implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 they will be 13 or 14, but all major processes have already been implemented under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated heavily in this operation too," the leader stressed.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Leaders and Executives of Aragón (ADA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process is "at the greatest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is carried out in the times in the past, not now, in business plans with the Bank of Spain," he emphatized.
"The 45-cash transition with an average of 28,500 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million is an uneven process in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to be consistent with Basel," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a number of rather unhappy views on the slowness of the process" that show "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain has made is to remind us that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year".
ECCA Director General José Antonio Olavarrieta said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and he has attributed it to people who doubt it to a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can stay very calm" with the situation of financial entities and savings boxes, a system that has begun a "very important" concentration process and "go to the greatest speed possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector suffered from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the Union as a whole.
Market tensions have caused a dual government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, ranging from tax reductions for SMEs, the regulation of private investment agencies or the abolition of the 426 euro aid to unemployed people without a professional contribution to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On another occasion, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joined the critics of Chancellor Angela Merkel with regard to his responsibility to delineate the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel's position is not a mistake in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction on the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which is shocking to keep the former traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible outcomes of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, incorporated by itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, and the south would leave the monetary area.
The second is Mark's recovery, even though it now seems like science fiction, with a very favourable opinion rate, almost 50% of the population.
The third, a new concept of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to the countries that violate them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extend to the private sector the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has long been defined, therefore now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of differences between what Germany thought should be done (tax rigour and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow of the Central European country was when Merkel had a difficult extension of the decision to save Greece.
Since then, it has been a fierce critic, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the publication were against Greece's rescue.
Finally, at the end of October, Merkel once again expressed a clear position by demanding the reform of the Union's treaties in order to enable a country to be rescued and at the same time forced private borrowers to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European because it has precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweetened, was approved and, in the following months, we should attend the reform process of the Union which makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And she tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we cannot agree too much, from that date on, the former operation of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which the countries that violate the rules will be severely penalized, they may be forced to declare themselves at the end of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also bear a portion of the costs.
Germany tells us that we must follow a strong path of growth with high savings and investment rates, consumption moderation, productivity and competitiveness improvements and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will simply not be tolerated.
It's clear.
And it would be bad if you didn't hear it.
This is not just about raising the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we're asking is much harder.
And what he must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring us greater calmness.
And that we know how to seize the opportunity that we have been given, until spring 2013.
President Zapatero also seems to have heard it in this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after the meeting last Saturday with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticisms, the way to the the thesis that must be ordered to the house has been opened.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And among the possibilities envisaged, it cannot be excluded from leaving too far-reaching a monetary area of less serious countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she had warned us.
Sport and fraud of the law
Russians like Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show the ingenuity but not the will to escape a punishment.
The original expulsion by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the 23 November match against Ajax in the Champions League has caused a lot of incretion on the anti-sportive nature of such behaviour and whether both players should be punished by the UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before the match (which their team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the arbitrator to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will end up being the leader of its group, both players will meet the regulatory sanctions during the next match of the battle against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished with two matches the team coach José Mourinho and various economic sums for the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow cardboard in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
A part of the debate in this case is due to the fact that this was a leading team of the Royal Madrid entity (which in its Hymne shows the nobleness and honor and in times past has condemned a fine to its players for similar acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, it seems by Mourinho, which adds a further episode to its long history of historical and provocative technicians.
In any case, the debate asks whether this kind of behaviour is not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether such actions are done by fraud; for they are, in fact, actions that are in conformity with the sport regulation, but seem to escape its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of injury they cause to the sport.
One of the assets that understand the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that with these actions has not been put at risk, i.e. there has not been a violent game.
Another of these assets to which we alluded with the right game is to avoid the unfair use of the criminal player team, which is not the case anymore.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the Royal Madrid players is that it does not fit to be characterized normally as fraud or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules has not been made in secret to try to avoid punishment, but their action has precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the punishment of the arbitrator.
They waited and willingly accepted the penalty.
Another issue is the type of advantage that offenders gain from the intentional errors they are considering.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and one does not gain an advantage in the same match no more, for of course the result of the action implies leaving their own team with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game anymore, because the club couldn't count on these players.
Obviously, the advantage is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cartons that can threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team could be eliminated all of a sudden and apart, with this action, players perform a sanctions match and pass on to the second round of cartons, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cartons occurs with one less than the first round.
So, recording the steps, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In the end, these actions are not contrary to the sport spirit, which makes even part of the strategic decisions that promote the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, players have not acted to avoid the application of the penalty (it would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law), or they have chosen rather the moment when they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without playing out the criminality or getting away from it.
Even though the boundary between the engineering and the fraud of the law is widespread, on this occasion I think we have had a clear case of engineering.
The controversy, it seems to me, is due to two factors: there were two self-exulsions and the way in which the directive was transmitted to provoke them.
The evil caused by the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in NCBs
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year on a range of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the bull and the lottery, when December comes, they also come back to dinner groups before Christmas, which continue to be the oxygen balloon for Barcelona's restaurants and entertainment, but which, because of the crisis, have resulted in a price-adjusted offensive to be able to catch the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinner or meals, coincide with businessmen and associations in the interviewed sector.
In order to complete accounting, this year's calendar (as the night of Saint Sylvestre falls on Friday) focused on applications in the week of December 13, which has so far resulted in a stream of dinner reservations for the peak days (17 and 17) and almost nothing last week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there have been many companies that have eliminated collective dinner for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they all demand battle prices, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauração de Barcelona, Gaietà Farras.
The representative of the patronal, at present, is not alone in predicting how the festivals will be held this month.
"People think a lot before booking."
"They want to get out, but they pay a lot of attention to prices," he says.
The case will go well "for those who give quality at good prices and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to descend a ladder with the crisis, so that the euro round has become majority in demand.
In a survey in various centres of the centre, there is a collapse of applications for the night of 17.
The Group of Soteras points out that there is a genuine boom of applications for this Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the economy, with full formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the speciality of the calendar has assumed more anticipated reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We made it impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all the tastes of 19,95 to 30 euros," they said.
AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, Quu and a total of 23 localities, remains optimistic after having detected a large amount of billing since the second semester and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group mention that 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends that celebrate the holidays in advance.
At their six group menus they added one for the night, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than the past year rather than demanding more details, such as the Catalan wine produced according to the champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies invite their employees again and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased slightly.
On the part of the Fecasarm patronage (including entities such as the Bars Association, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gomà, is in charge of starting to see the end of the tunnel and argues that reservations are "animated", although customers "negotiated at the most".
That is true, the hope for festivals has not diminished, indistinguishably from who pays, indicate it.
Pakistan ' s nuclear programme is a major concern for the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks filters confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US Embassy of Pakistan and the United States Department of State filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns posed by the Pakistan nuclear programme in Washington.
Apart from the clear and enjoyable details that offer on the content of the talks and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, rather than increasing, "decreases" and that the established Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
The particularity of the Pakistan nuclear programme - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main causes of concern in Washington.
This is how the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, reports in a report prior to the visit of the former National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear installations in the territory under attack by the Taliban, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose short noise and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials."
The vast number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is considered, not only by the United States but also by Russia, as a proliferator and as a reason for maintaining the guard.
"Pakistan has to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear installations; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev, of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by the Julian Assange portal is the ever-increasing cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high level of Pakistani nuclear weapons production.
A mission from the Embassy in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", supports the following: "Transparency is often nonexistent; assistance offers remain unanswered or eliminated".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a member of the National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that "in spite of the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaqkayani, to make it clear to the responsible that "Pakistan's Army must end with the support of the terrorist groups."
Hunting the Chief of Wikileaks
Obama will count to a high level responsible for the fight against terrorism to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol emits a red alert to monitor the movements and locate in Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and his founder, Julian Assange, form a complex labyrinth where it is difficult to have certainty about facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, this is not new, but it is the 20th of November.
And it has nothing to do with the last filtration of over four million United States diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that Australia faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks Creator's lawyer, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
On 20th the international police force in Lyon (France) issued the order at Sweden's request, but it was not made public until yesterday, after having received the authority of that country.
Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol received the indication to identify or locate Assange "to obtain its provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot give the arrest order to an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the call to the red notice a free way for arrest -- which the national police body must carry out - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is thought to be located.
The movement incited Assange's lawyers, who yesterday issued a letter denouncing the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks, who was willing to respond by video-conference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange sought and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, that he was compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, chief of security of Stalin.
"That seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," reports the Missive.
While the world is looking for him - and in Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he did not hide.
On Monday, he gave an unspecified interview to the director of the Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it has been responsible for giving orders to American diplomats that they wish the United Nations by violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the Press Secretary of the House-Blanche, Robert Gibbs, who described the application for resignation as "religious and absurd".
"I'm not sure why the opinion of a guy with a website should interest us," he told CNN.
Obama himself charged with a high responsibility for the fight against terrorism, Russell Travers, to prevent new leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's spokesman's attempt to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman, who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower Chamber from January, asked the Department of State to consider including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and continue to provide contributions or assistance to anyone".
Even further, Tom Flanagan, a Canadian president's advisor Stephen Harper, has to return to his statements after saying that Assange should "be murdered".
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something like that."
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, the Baptist minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possibly a presidential candidate.
"The person who is in the Government who has filtered the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not an execution would be too kind a punishment," he said to Fox.
Puigcercos seeks peace in ERC with eyebrows at Carod fans
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercos seems to have found the revenue to resolve the 1st internal revolution within the ERC, without north due to the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his threat of resignation is not sufficient for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that it cannot give him any headaches that he had with other large currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new criticisms with eyebrows that allow him to blink to municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercos announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisors will be able to vote on his continuity in secret.
By ballots, not by raising your hand.
If the cardiologists want to drive a certain vote of punishment to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of the class wants to avoid divisional image and submission to his person.
In several interviews, he stated that he would not consider himself to be ratified with half more than one vote, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "to Bulgaria" would not be good anymore.
People close to Carod demand the president a little more than to make their position available for the campaign, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercos controls the maximum body between the congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to approve with the executive a road map until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic re-orientation document that the management will submit to the vote of the National Council on 18.
Its intention is to support Puigcercos in exchange for his promise to program the congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider to be a sure fact.
The leader of the ERC admitted that the "polyphonie" affects stability and that its goal is to make it once for all the organization capable of washing its room in the family.
In this line, the article that the current advisor Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considering Puigcercós ideologist, the owner of Innovation thought that the leader would be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, two of them.
The first, "composing" the executive to represent at least 90% of the campaign, i.e., includes new figures coming from the appropriate sector of Carod.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC be liquid once and for all the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that enables congresses to be conducted through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcercos team, which has already fought in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the conclave of 2008 commissioned the management to review the assembly model at a specific status reform conference.
This meeting remains incomplete, as the internal tide in recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors at the end, the time could be good for it to be resumed and closed forever.
23 implemented in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, a decrease of 4 cases was recorded compared to 2010.
In November, 23 persons were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
These three women are mentioned among the murders and the discovery of two bodies cut in the Valley of Mexico.
During the previous month of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in theory related to organized crime.
Among the cases are mentioned one of the bodies found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlan, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three firearms and the head, except for the feet and hands attached with a cable.
The following day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of a vehicle abandoned in Mixtecas Street in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, of the municipality of Naukalpan.
Very early on Thursday morning, the four owners of shared land found a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal fires in the thorax, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the sector that crosses the village Villa Guerrero.
Near the body, we found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day after Nezahualcoyotl a 50-year-old gentleman was murdered with eight shots of fire when he left his house to initiate the collection of orders.
On November 7, two 30-year-old subjects were killed by a head-on impact of fire in the colony San Pedro Xaloxtoc, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the strike of grace in the front, a man's body was found on a lonely path by Colonia El Naranjo and under the body was found a bullet-fighted with a 25-caliber firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the Black Water Canal of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
Emergency bodies have carried out a thorough search of the rest of the body members, but they have not been found.
The inhabitants of Tepotzotlán warned of the discovery of a corpse that was in Peña Colorado, the hands tied behind and the eyes tied.
The man had a wound caused by a blow of firearm in the nuke.
In the mid-month, the execution of two men who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality of Atizapan of Zaragoza was reported, at the same time with the victims two death warnings.
One day later, a carton containing a human head was found in the Valley de los Reyes colony in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by the Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the hamlet of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning the body of a man in Huixquilucan who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue cover, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, according to a message that his executioners had left beside him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the nuke, we found the dead body of a woman in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the woman's skin, tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces were detected with her image.
Towards the end of the month, the body of a man was found on board a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three hits and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, two men's corpses with their head all over the year and a message were found in the community of Ponte de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said, "This is what happens to those who do not align themselves."
At Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet attached, two bodies were found inside a taxi abandoned behind the St. Augustine colony Justice Centre.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first one had been decapitated in the colony Cuchilla Ancón and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, attached to a canal rubber and a side message; while the second one had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Next to him, the agents found a Bristol with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
The representative of that country in COP16 has ensured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and has detailed that it maintains its bid to reduce by 2020 between 40 and 45 per cent of its greenhouse gas emissions.
China maintains its bid to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020, Su Wei, a representative of the country at COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei ensured that its country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and to convert its industry.
In fact, he explained that over the past four years, his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been recorded in all these areas, including the approval, last year, of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the objectives discussed with regard to greenhouse gas reduction, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with governments and local authorities to achieve energy saving objectives, efficient energy use and emissions reduction.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans under way or completed, both financed by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (United Nations), the Government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of incandescent lamps by economic lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the government of that country in terms of climate change, ensured that China's efforts were greater than we thought.
For example, the per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are three tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9 per cent of the historical contribution to pollution.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to make another similar by 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of PAN explained that the former Paniste leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez, ensured that Manuel Espino Barrientos' expulsion was legal and that the former Paniste leader had the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what was right.
In his previous interview with Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case, Espino's expulsion was a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr Espino has the right to address, where appropriate, a claim to the National Council Order Commission, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he made it clear that this is not the time to think in 2012 and that there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that Action Nacional would be stronger after the next 4 and 5 December internal elections where a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the time being, that has been an approach to the local elections that has been successful and has achieved its objective," he said.
The Paniste leader mentioned that PAN was supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; rather, "we taste and make us stronger," he said.
He said that the council would no doubt elect the best leader the Action Nacional needs for the next three years, so it would give the "person determined by the council."
"I'm completely quiet and open, I'd be proud to leave the party president's office to any of the five."
He predicted that the resumption recorded by the party in the elections last July 4th will be reflected in the next dispute, even though "it is not yet the time to think about 2012."
"For the time being it is to accompany Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that come from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that "many hopes have been made with them, and I am sure that Gabino will be at the height of expectations".
When asked about PRI's criticisms against President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the priests to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas of Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calderón; that they start defending them; that they come out of 'armor'," he said.
He said that the holder of the Federal Executive could make expressions like those he had made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because there was no balloon in the country, and less censorship.
Obama promotes on Twitter the law for students without paper
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitté said the American President in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today met with national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize students without paper, with a message in his personal account of the social network Twitter.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitte Obama said.
Its short message maintains a cyber-related link with a broader document that requests the public to contact the senators immediately, as the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote we hope soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the increase in taxes in Bush's time and the government's funding is extended.
Such a blocking, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned about the Republican Lockdown of the Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs spokesperson said that he is confident that once the tax problem is resolved, an agenda for the rest of the projects can be set.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be solved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at a given time in that sense and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the Senate democratic majority, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he was going to ask for a "conclusion vote" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legitimize undocumented students could be voted on from Thursday in the Senate, even if the most likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Rêve Act would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, who remained in that country for the past five years and were accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But the partisans need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they need the support of a large number of Republicans, at times when the partisan organizations of the protagonist project have an intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
At least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only a Republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the partisans of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most polite Republicans there are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator from George Lemieux, Florida, who completed his mandate as Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, from Texas, but they said they were not going to support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not so far defined his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree with the fact that the biggest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literature we put the finger on the wound
The second stage of the Pleasures of the Language was a walk in which participants highlighted the narrative
"The sex in the language, I understand, but... the finger on the wound? what do you expect of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and which this time used the sub-title of her question (for another time the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, she explained it).
The finger on the wound"...we put it in the embarras", gently launched the Argentine writer to the public, most of the young people who had met at the International Book of Guadalajara (FIL) Forum to listen to this moderate table by Marisol Shultz and who participated in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz later defined as a great story, with Luisa as the first person as a protagonist who seeks to know what the "place" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only tracks in the same narrative line.
Of the infectionologist she is convinced: "The patience is not my strength, it may be my plague."
Finally, after a frustrating approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains that the wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the plague is what is opened in reality, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed and concluded: "On the wound I only knew that it is in reality that it is open and that it does not exist," but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be closely linked to them.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a thrilling narrative he called Eloge to the invention, where the finger on the wound is not named but at a given time is discovered.
With the touch of magical reality, he spoke of a famous loudspeaker who touched the clouds, brought back people who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a lady had lost, a narrative that turned to talk then to America, the great news that had had its own chroniclers from the beginning, and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo as criticizing the excessive narratives of the competing captains.
"Cervants who invented us all (the writers) laughed at false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a way we would never have told the story of America with an imagination that lacked even the dust."
However, he pointed out that "the fools and liars have the best imagination" and here the reality converges with the lie, we no longer know what part of the narrative belongs to a band or another, where fiction literature reaches its apoge.
This is actually called the 'Tradition of Cervantes'.
"It's thanks to his legacy that we're what we're counting on."
In turn, author Mayra Montyero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations provoked by the FIL's invitation with its round table The duty on the wound.
The Cuban-Portorician has put his mind on the great plague of social violence that his country is experiencing - and Latin America is sharing - it produces disputes about trafficking and the sale of drugs.
"I think that good literature, good poetry the good songs refer to a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditated," she said, after quoting that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment between the author and readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of Spanish poet Luis García Montero, who also stressed "the duty of the ordained writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at great speed also with regard to intellectual habits and control of consciences that are turning to the advantage of dogmatisms, "after each claim there is a small no and after each denial there is a small yes".
"To be masters of our own feelings and masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means many times putting the finger on the wound and disturbing people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuances, and also disturbing the powers that prefer a white and black world," he said, inviting to recover the meaning of writing.
Romano on the hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three faults in the finals he had high and low in his career, but he was able to reach the final series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that are faced, marked by their technicians, who find a contrast between them marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three faults in the finals, he had highs and lows in his career, but he was able to reach the final series three times, even though so far he has not put in a thousand and that is why this opportunity is very special to him.
Argentina ended up comforting itself with the sub-moon medal, it remained a step behind the winners and carefully with the same team it played successful finals.
The holy strategy came to its first final as a coach in the Open Tour 2002 when he held Morelia's reindeer with which he lost with a total result of 4-2 against Toluca; later in 2003 he also arrived at the final due and lost again with the total result of 3-1 and that was exactly against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already in the 2010 Bicentenary Tournament, Rubén again suffered a relapse, because his team had a match of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties he got an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed 11 meters and he suffered the leap as a result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, so he doesn't want to have the same fate, he tries to get rid of the evil so he can celebrate for the first time a title, even if he says that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, it's not for a passion that I have, and therefore I'll get the title, but what I mentioned earlier is more important," said the driver when he was asked what would be his weak points in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the final, of which he assures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can hold on to is that until the arbitrator suffocates the final, we can't celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to pull us were already prepared to run, and I think that this is a lesson, before the end of the game we can't celebrate".
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to end in a regular time, but sometimes we only prepare ourselves, the previous tournament we have prepared, unfortunately fate has made us a bad turn, sometimes it is the emotions or the anxiety of keeping the title between our hands, hands he has left us, it has served us as a lesson for this end and we hope that we will not get there again."
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a champion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining the visa
People must go to the Visa Applicants Service centres before their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting will be reduced.
As of 10 January 2011, the procedure for processing visas at the United States Embassy and consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to submit themselves to the Visa Applicants Service Centres (ASC) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will receive biometric information from the applicant, which will be revised by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will have some benefits for aspirants, including the following:
The total cost of treating the visa will be lower, no longer will be necessary to make a payment to obtain a meeting, another payment for the processing of the visa and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The aspirant will make a unique payment that will cover the three services.
The current rate will remain the same: $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas on request (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for traders and investors visas.
Persons wishing to renew their visas will not be required to submit to an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only submit to the closer ASC where they will submit the documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be included in the ASC, applicants wishing to meet for a second meeting to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain there less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra 26-dollar service fee.
For further information on the new procedure for requesting visa, please visit the following page: http://mexico.usebassy.gov/balletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The space agency of the United States called the press to present a discovery tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow, at 13:00 a.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for astrobiology experts, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When she quoted the press, NASA ensured that she would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which led to speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments thought uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions were improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of the Mono Lake in the National Park Yosemite, California, which lives in an environment that we thought was too friendly for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any case, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our volunteer atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, unlike what we know."
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the findings at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiology Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturne's largest satellite), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergence and Block-Responsive Pattern
With reforms to the Organic Act of Congress, the arrival of 'bipartism' is possible, we denounce it.
In the 1960s, when a opposition to the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalvo appeared in Congress, it was declared independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'tonnain' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, have they repeated, the 'bipartism' is being launched because now there are two people, from the same number of parties, who control Congress.
The four MPs, next to Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, the coordinator of the PRD, were the only to vote against the PANIST-chaired director Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these institutional reforms constitute the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that the following days they would speak to PAN and PRI representatives to modify the scheme by political will and if they did not, they would be once again served by both parties and thus the opposing coalition would end.
"Since this happened (the opposing coalition), that is what I am looking at, because we are excluded from any decision, they have not even the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia, mentioned that there are coincidences with PRD, PT and Pattern and that is why they form a plural group.
We cannot allow the Congress, after being monopolistic, to be "duopolitic" now.
"It is not the spirit of the reform of the law that there is an eternal bipartism in Congress."
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to make them more numerous, the Convergent has added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT, explained that the Congress was now transformed into a 'butin' between two, alluding to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two."
Mr Montalvo asked him to respect the Member's personality, to give his place to the negotiating tables.
"If they do not leave us with collective agreements outside 5 that are likely to be 9 Members, now at five that we see, separated in different fractions, we have decided to join us to look for a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform they have made, that they have decided, that we are outside and that we do not agree with this reform."
$200 million extra for "the supplier"
The Mairie de Mazatlán pays another check to the owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check of about 200 miles of weight for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the Mairie.
With this, the amount paid this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 miles.
According to the City's Transparency Page, the last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 billion 144.56 weights, in the form of "delivery accounts" .
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Community would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State's Higher Audit to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many cheques will still be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what he needs, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks have "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, October 15, October 19, October 29, and November 16th.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, according to the provisions of the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, in order to avoid other Governments using its services, the Treasury has ensured that they have not used its services again.
All of this, after 25 July in the Northwest, had published a review of checks that Mairie issued to its suppliers, revealing that in the interval of March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennat of Major Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the paying municipality of Camacho Palazuelos has more than 10 million weights, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, covering checks of more than 3 million weights.
Tourist sites should be cared for
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the bad conditions of the Sánchez Taboada round-point in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a crossroads of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout, the tourist sector in Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are under bad conditions and design a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of Zona Dorada, recalled that they repeatedly requested that the image of the destination be taken care of and that new activities should be replaced by others that tourists find bad.
He said that the bad state of the streets and sidewalks had affected because tourists had come to walk there and they saw the disorder and avoided close trades.
"Politicians don't know what it means to shut down a business one day and they don't know the fortune we lose, but they didn't do the work for so long and without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist crash exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance of the Mairie side.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibilities and avoid this happening again, how to do so, so through a preventive interview and not only correcting it," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live there and the Mary must change her strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it not only depends on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has the propriety in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"We didn't pay attention to them, and this kind of fact emphasizes something that is known to everyone, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, under Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the recovery of the tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent because they are not properly used and design a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must be put together with the municipality and be a priority for having the city up-to-date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Happyly Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and sites that should be ordered first, cleaned and put on-line to make them attractive to be able to add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination."
IP Request for Results at Congress
Mr Davalos, President of the CEC, proposed that the Members take the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various challenges they face.
The business sector in Mazatlán calls for a decent and free labour legislation between the parties and the Government Executive, as Sinaloa is overwhelmed and is facing major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th legislation was established by seven political forces, 19 PRI MPs, 13 PAN, three from the New Alliance Party, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergence and one from PVEM, a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress are a clean and committed management with society and the various sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same model of party or paternism do not repeat itself.
Mr Davalos, President of the CEC, proposed that the Members take the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various challenges they face.
"We hope that the Members actually exercise their right, free of agreement between the parties, because the custom is that they make pacts to ensure their own interests and they turn into a carnival mask of the governors and leaders of the parliamentary factions."
That is why I ask them to confirm their commitment to establish the necessary bridges that the current Governor is making progress.
"We will ensure that they do a decent and especially committed work with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, considered that one of the major provocations of the 40 popular representatives was to push and add forces by seeking the economic growth of the State, because the economic situation is now very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they increase economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and this will in a way stimulate the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators give him the importance he had in the government budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
"I understand that it is the second State Secretariat with a smaller budget and it is inconsistent as an important and generous economic activity of foreign exchange and investment and that it is directly rivaling the agro-industry."
Apart from the fact that resources must be classified as resources for detonating tourism projects that help to provide support to the State and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislation has not been able to resolve.
We're looking for a king of magic.
Peoples, cars and bicycles, including toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Kings Mages will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their home is formed by no more than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble home of Colonia Salvador Allende and they live up to the day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes...and after noon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell in the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her 3-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
In his turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo longs to have a 'monster truck' and for his 8-month-old brother, Jesus, Cayetana suggests a year-long dress.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I'd like to have this monster', but I told him 'we'll see, son', because he was very expensive," recalls Cayetana with sadness.
For older children, who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
11-year-old Maria Guadalupe has a 12-year-old shoe; 10-year-old Isaiah has a 10-year-old shoe while 8-year-old Miguel has an 8-year-old shoe.
José Juan, aged 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of sizes five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the On Search King Mage campaign, giving a toy or money to the Northwest reception.
14 drug trafficking suspects arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Austria on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used in the production of drugs.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of haschich, money and equipment used for production have been seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson for Québec Security.
All in all, eleven men and three women were arrested, two of which were the leaders of this network, two men of Sherbrooke.
The persons arrested were to be compared to the Sherbrooke Court within hours of their arrest.
They could deal with allegations of cannabis production, possession in order to traffic, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches took place following a long-haline investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It is information received from the public that has enabled us to carry out these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police officers from the Regional Investigation Module of the Québec Security Estrie, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremag Police Department took part in this police operation.
Clandestine migration can continue without problems
The draft law of conservatives, which the government considers should address the problem of illegal migrants' ships, is clearly to be fought when the three opposition parties indicated on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I strongly support the Charter."
"I stand with a party that created granite under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow a person to hold up to one year from a ship identified as a carrier of illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also stated that he could not support the bill because he took it to the wrong target.
"We are against and it seems that all the parties to the opposition are against, so we will see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD's immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, rejected the criticism that her party was not strong enough about illegal immigrants.
"The neo-democratics agree to take action against clandestine passengers and that is what we do through another bill, C-35," said Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the conservative bill because it takes refugees to jail children for at least one year," said Ms. Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians say massively to the MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country as a strawberry."
"They expect Canada to take firm measures," said Minister Kenney.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections that resulted in its rejection.
A conservative, however, told the QMI Agency that the government was going to ask for a vote so that every opposer would then explain himself to his electors.
The new unit does not do the same.
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collapse by Jean Charest, many observers continue to request the establishment of a public investigation commission on the subject.
The Minister of Public Security Robert Dutil argues that this idea is not yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation in New York on this matter from January.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Québec police services, on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite Robert Dutil's presence.
It was no longer necessary for the Pakistani public security critic, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this ad for "lapin out of a hat" and for "brilled solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil replied to those who feared that political power had too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You're going to see the result when we announce it, is he happy to say it?"
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public investigation.
"More Mr. Charest insists on not wanting to set up this committee of inquiry, more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is to resign Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, he therefore suggested that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor-General to investigate corruption and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a Commissioner, thus enabling him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent shield is not the only project in the charts of the Charest government.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request would come from the Prosecutor of Operation Marseau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in such investigations.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering certain amendments related to this case.
During the Spring 2001 operation, which hit the motorcycle groups, even though the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa then passed the Gangsterism Act.
High surveillance rivers
Several watercourses remain under high surveillance due to the strong precipitations that have fallen on several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A field glazing took place on Wednesday afternoon, in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses have been evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening, another glazing would take place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road went off.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy precipitation fell on several regions, from 40 to 70 millimetres of rain.
From 20 to 40 millimetres of extra rain were expected by Thursday night, depending on the regions.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouai valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimetres of rain in total.
As these precipitations need to be added to the source of the already accumulated snow in some sectors, several water courses are feared.
Warnings of flooding were issued on Wednesday night by the Civil Security of Quebec for the Oueau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The northern rivers, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurantides, and in China, in Lotbinière, were subject to flood guards and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, the high rainfall led to the landing of some lakes in Sainte-Julian, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken because of the heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated by preventive measures.
In Outauais, the landing of some lakes led to the closure of several roads, including in the municipality of Mansfield- and Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on alert and monitors the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, a Security Adviser.
For its part, the Quebec Crusade Forecast Centre has issued on Wednesday strong crusades warnings for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Oueau, Achigan, Batiscan and the Loup.
Dupont partly coated
Québec Radio Animator Stéphane Dupont submitted a partial reverse to the Canadian Council of Radio Television Standards (CCNR) for controversial issues on social assistance and Haitians as well as on its large-scale wave language.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but that some of the issues contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, inadvertently negative representations of the Haitians and wholesale language that did not fit the broadcasts during the day".
The Commission also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two persons who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Joint Front of Social Assistance in Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the issue were incorrect.
Animators must present solid information rather than frauds.
As for suicide, animator Stéphane Dupont had considered suicide to be an act of launch.
Most members of the Committee concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of "Dupon the Midi" have dealt with a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate manner."
Thus, no blame has been taken to its place.
The last dispute covered statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort were then delivered to a media-faced face that had generated many reactions.
The CHOI animator stated that he had made no donation to help the Haitians because it was not possible to know for sure that the needed people would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect is an indisputable negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already had my three-day suspension over there."
"My file has been a virgin for a year and a half," said the animator.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the widespread dissemination of language.
In each case, the CHOI-FM radio broadcaster collaborated "in addition to its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which, among other things, will have to announce these decisions once during the long hours of listening within three days.
A king of the kung fu in Montréal
The Algerian Montréal of origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special course.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing goes up on the tatamis and the world's rings in search of new challenges.
"I began to practice martial arts such as kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria, Zemmal, installed in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve in professionals."
"In my case, I'm trying to fight a little everywhere, because for those who don't like the game on the ground in mixed martial arts, the competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the person who works as a security agent and as a contractor for the UPS has just delivered bad news to its rivers, winning two gold medals at the World's World Cup amateur Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23-30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai boxing, he explained."
"Currently, I'm preparing to go to China for the World Cup of San Show."
"The fighters who ended up among the first four in the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I won the bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I completed the fifth grade tournament, while I arrived third in Toronto in 2009, did he add."
"What's interesting is that I've made progress at every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
The "san show" or "sand" is a discipline originating in China where the punching and footing, as well as projections on the ground, are allowed.
The duels initially take place on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous Pugilist from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well-known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event in his career, he will certainly respond to his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the most famous and prestigious in China, explained the friendly galillard."
"It's a little equivalent to the Lumpinee Stade (the largest stage in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first battle, half-end of his category (80 kg), before losing in the end.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, did he analyze."
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"Half-final winners face their category at the end."
"Then the winners of each category face to crown one champion, the king of the kung fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec granted $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
In the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium of BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor that has obtained the most important, project management, for a sum of $295 million without a call for tenders.
This consortium, called Energy Management, was formed in 2004 in conjunction with the choice of Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important 5 billion-dollar hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management Consortium decoupled the profit-making contract without calling for public tenders.
For the Quebec Party, the use of companies' consortia poses a serious ethical problem that could eliminate competition and cause price increases.
"It's the new way to make collisions and defeat competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing so in secret, are now doing so openly," said Pakistani MP Sylvain Simard yesterday at a press conference.
Earlier this morning, Mr. Simard raised the question to the National Assembly because he said that it was difficult to see how the public interest could be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, strongly denying that there was a collision for this contract.
"I began to have my journey," she said, arguing that the PQ had been "suffering" and "missing hard".
She said that "it would be the least of things" that the PQ apologized for.
The consortium formula is a common practice worldwide.
This is usually a limited alliance in time that allows two or more companies to group their respective expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity in view of the scope of the work.
The yard is underway and is to be phased out until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the competition game acting; there was negotiation.
Thus, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week by the Devoir, the Consortiums in the Engineering Council sector are being investigated by the government.
A quick overfly of the Québec Business Register enables more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, brings back to one and even moral person, or Dessau.
With regard to the energy management consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of Baie James is responding to particular man-work dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been responding specifically to it since the 1970s".
The major patron of the Eastmain project, Real Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Society (SEBJ), explained that the project's management contract was granted freely.
"If you go for offers and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: whether you take the people who are in this market and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that this is not the price that is important, that is the competence of the people," said Mr Laporte.
This contract awarded to the consortium Energy management is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir had 109 engineering and consulting contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has reached 22 contracts, Geneva has won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, with no participation in Energy management.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449 783 344, including the energy management contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard said that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has made it clear that the PQ is also linked to these "funding" firms, before stating that it was rather their leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in equitable brands and environmental certifications to guide its choices.
Although he is bathing in a media universe where the messages in favour of more responsible consumption are pulsating, he deplores a lack of credible information, because it even limits his commitment, indicates the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Even though they have increased the consumption of products said socially responsible in 2010, the Quebecans seem to give very little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say that they do not believe in the environmental commitment of companies, as well as the green advertising of companies, reveal the measuring tool developed by the Observatory for Responsible Consumption at Sherbrooke University.
Another finding is that half of consumers have doubts about the reliability of official certifications based on the said products, but also about the credibility of products and brands that appear to be eco-responsible, says Barometer.
In the same vein, the speech of politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, information on responsible consumption seems to be essential to stimulate this diet, which is now being promoted by nearly one third of Quebec's consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the questionable nature of the information would calm the fires of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers are also saying that they are also suspicious of the alleged performance of green products or services they are trying to put in their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 to have changed their habits and, above all, changed their brand of one or more products to respond to their convictions.
At 61%, they also promoted purchases from traders in their neighborhood and privileged the purchase of food products grown in their region, says Barometer.
More green and responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 to a maximum of 100 for this year - , the Homo consumus du Québec likes to appear as the king of recycling who is trying to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about animal protection.
However, its social and environmental consciousness seems to remain outside its car, says Barometer: in 2010, almost 28% of Quebecers indicated that they had used the transport in common or recommended co-sponsorship to defend their green interests.
The march and bike were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioral investigation, which had just taken its first click.
A loan from the State for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, to whom it was asked to engage financially in the purchase of the eXcentris film complex by the Angus and the Parallel Society, agrees to cooperate, but in the competition of only one loan.
The Angus and the Parallel Development Society, who were expecting a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on the Saint Laurent Boulevard by giving him his full cinematic vocation, did not get what they were demanding.
The government agrees to be involved in the file, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan of less than the initial expectations, which could provide a viable solution to favourable conditions, at least from the opinion of the sources from the State offices.
A first action plan and a 12.8 million application had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but applications have since been reviewed at a reduced rate.
A proposal and action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who is driving the eXcentris file.
He got him a final report a dozen days ago.
But the counter-proposal of the cabinet came to SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have up to 31 December to respond to it.
However, it seems that the assumption of the gift of the State must really be omitted.
Let us recall that the Association of Québec Movie and Film Owners opposed a direct investment by the State to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it has not done for other cinema halls.
However, several environmental stakeholders were calling for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of the scene, for ten years carried the author's film in his complex premises after financing his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is creating in Montréal, and eXcentris had its loyalty to its clientele.
The Angus and the Parallel Society, with their head Christian Yaccarini, piloted, on their side, a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push the acquisition wheel.
Since spring 2009, one of the three screens, Le Parallele, has continued to broadcast films to eXcentris.
The purpose of the future buyers is to reopen the three halls next February 27th by designing the very beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall The Devoir and we ignore what he and his group think about the low proposals made to them.
The veil raised on a complex Canada...
The new American diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks raise the veil that the United States views as the Canadians' inferiority complex to the Americans, but at the same time they bring the feeling of superiority to Canada.
Thus, American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian elector does not have Canadian-American relations in mind by voting and believe that President Obama's visit helped the conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, located in the public square yesterday, offer more cross-cutting details than substantial content to be put under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in the federal electoral campaign, relates to what extent the United States is not part of the issues discussed by the political leaders.
To the great surprise of the US Ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offered a few explanations to this situation.
"A complex of almost inherent Canadian inferiority may condition Canadian political leaders to talk about internal issues of the daily rather than make this election take place in the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign), " he writes.
The United States, therefore, concludes that "the elephant probial of this election: omnipresent but potentially too threatening to speak of it".
The ambassador understands so much less the "stupid silence" that both countries have a strong political and economic relationship.
"Providedly, it considers that the ability of a candidate, a party and even more than one party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind by voting."
The other expression of this sense of importance lies in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, business manager in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival at the beginning of February's vote of confidence in the federal budget, whereby Canada will display its first deficit over a decade due to a resumption plan of $30 billion to $40 billion," wrote Mr. Breese.
No mention was made of the fact that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas in order to avoid being reversed by the coalition and that the opposition parties made their conditional survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, prevents Washington from becoming increasingly negative than the drama series broadcast to CBC from referring to the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the Border, Little Moscow on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which few subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the CIA's musculoske interrogations are observed.
Another cable relates that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was ready to welcome some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of the "case by case".
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "He sent a paper to the State Secretary about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, let's note that the spirits fail about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former consultant very close to Stephen Harper, said on the waves of CBC that the responsible for this massive escape should be "killed".
Mike Huckabee was disappointed in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renovate Light
The United Nations proposed yesterday in Cancún a plan for the renovation of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse gas reduction (GES) that corresponds almost to a third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the wake of major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún in order to compensate for the absence of binding commitments to reduce by industrialized countries.
According to the plan filed yesterday, if the incandescent ampoules that monopolies still from 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluo-compact ampoules or, better, electroluminescent (DEL or "LED") ampoules, the main of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GES emissions on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the planetary car park.
In Copenhagen last year, the major issuer countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should lead to global GHG emissions from GHG 53 to 49 Gt.
But it will have to be removed from this balance sheet another 5 Gt to stabilize the rise in climate by 2020 to 2 degrees centigrades in order to avoid becoming out of control.
In the incandescent ampoules, 95% of the energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, or 5%, is produced from light.
With fluo-compact ampoules, the energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new DEL ampoules, this need for energy is reduced twice again.
Fluo-compact ampoules last from 6000 to 10,000 hours on average.
New ampoules in DEL, like those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company also participated in the study of the United Nations - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent ampoule, which gives an idea of the economy possible with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
All these new ampoules can also work with rheostats in addition to producing very little heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have made reservations to the site of fluo-compact ampoules as they contain mercury and have to be disposed of as hazardous wastes, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put in place signals.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluo-compact ampoule, but rather the coal thermal power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce spent electricity in incandescent ampoules.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the achievements that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, or the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants that would cost it 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire looks forward to the announcement of election results
The Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon requested the publication of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire after the deadlines had expired.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without delay," stressed a spokesman for the United Nations Chief of Staff."
"He calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to be held accountable and to refrain from any initiative until the announcement of provisional results."
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the electoral commission left the date of Wednesday afternoon's vote without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's vote.
About forty minutes before the deadline expired, the Chairman of the ICB had stated on television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls multiplied on Wednesday in the world so that the CEI finally proclaims the name of the winner of the second round between the exit Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp is counting on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraud" votes in the north, held by the former Revolution of the Forces nouvelles (FN) since the coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director of the Ivorian President, said that the intimidating exercises of the UN voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's party from going to vote.
All elections could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo were retained by the Constitutional Council.
Gbagbo's opponents believe that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the North who desecrates everything with the former rebels, considered the delay in announcing the results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go until he claimed the victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that bringing complaints before the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidency, on Sunday, was intended to crown the process of reconciling and reconciling a country that remained divided in two years.
The United Nations warned the Ivorian political class on Wednesday that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had completed the first round on October 31, with 38% of the votes against 32% in Alaskan Ouattara, who received the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédie (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France at the 3rd quarter
The rate of unemployment in France as defined by the International Labour Office (BIT) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolis (9.7% with overseas departments), showing the corrected seasonal changes (CVS) data published on Thursday by the Insee.
The number of unemployed is 2,631 million in metropolis.
Data in the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the active population in metropolis and 9.7% with DOMs.
Over a year, the unemployment rate appears at a higher rate of 0.1 points.
More widely, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available in the two weeks to work and whether they were looking for a job or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has still deteriorated, with a new increase in the unemployment rate, bringing to 24.2% in metropolis (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% including DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the BIT.
Seniors have experienced a slight increase in unemployment, at 6.4% in metropolis (+0.2 points over three months and one year), or 482,000 people over 50 years of age or older, and 6.6% with DOMs.
Only 25-49 years have benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter, at 8.3% in metropolis (-0.1 point in three months, +0.1 point in one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
The Insee no longer publishes monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a discussion on its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union Statistics Agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a 9.8% rate for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini reviewed and detained
Alexandre Guerini, 53 years old, leader of the PS president of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône, has been examined and destroyed at the Luynes stop house near Aix-en-Provence in an investigation into alleged fraudulent public markets.
Alexandre Guerini has been examined for the abuse of social property, the diversion of funds and public property, recoil, active corruption, trafficking in influence and the detention of ammunition.
"Alexandre Guerini is combative and tends to explain all the questions the magistrate will ask him, not ghosts."
"It's easy to pursue it for a multitude of representative leaders, it's something else to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told the AFP before his client's hearing.
Mr. Guerini, the strong man's brother of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guerini, had, through his lawyers, taken a memo before his hearing to explain.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezi, was also examined on Wednesday night and scrupulously.
According to his lawyer, Me Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but to make the discharges he had to manage.
As to the allocation of the markets or the destination of the funds related to their operation, he never knew of them, said Me Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Aubagne Assembly Services, was examined on Wednesday for the diversion of public and complicity funds, and left free under judicial control with the prohibition of meeting the stakeholders in the file.
"My client has been able to provide explanations of the facts that he is being blamed for."
"The teacher's magistrate took it into account not to deprive him of freedom," said his lawyer, Me Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been examined and released on Tuesday to Wednesday night, with a judicial check-up for two of them, reported the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic of Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director-General for the Cleanliness of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is being pursued for "trafficking and passive corruption".
Two officials of the Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Briguier, are being examined one for "substrating and diverting public goods by a person in charge of a public service mission", the other for "complicity of diverting public funds".
Finally, the company of Alexander Guerini, Jeannie Peretti, was examined for "receiving the abuse of social property".
Among those who were confronted with Mr. Guerini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently found in a parallel case of fraudulent public markets affecting the Corse.
The investigators suspect that their companies have served to whiten out the money of the great banditism.
The investigation is carried out in the context of several open legal information against X in April 2009 following anonymous mails, for alleged fraud in the procurement of public procurement, particularly in the waste chain.
Close to the investigation, investigations focus on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a discharge from La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne as well as certain cities of the urban community of Marseille (PMM).
Clotilde Reiss case: The Elysée has exacerbated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spionage", held the Haleine opinion in France, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
Everything in the eyes of U.S. diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by the World reveal some under this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, going to give them advice on the treatment of their own "totage" crises in Iran (a small group of tenants).
They show how the French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French had not had to counter the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detainee in France and sought by the American justice for the trafficking of materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they put themselves under a harsh light the way the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to validate the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage cases".
The advisor of the Elysée for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Qai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, deals with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain to him the French method.
They advise the Americans to do so in order to repatriate their own nationals held in force in Iran.
"Fates of noise," they say, "martling continuously" in the media the words "the fundamental human rights", "innocentness", "immediate release".
It is necessary to embarrase the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it as much as the Iranians ask you not to do it."
Because, in the past, the attempts to discuss through discreet channels, "the silence will rule nothing", the Iranians are "masters in dilaratory maneuvers".
Mr. Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is "a family Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss (who will take place on 16 August, the day she took refuge in the French Embassy) "will require payment to the Iranians of a large amount of money" (EUR 230,000).
And he tells us that the Elysate anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that will "get worse".
Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose United States proclaims extradition for illegal trafficking in sensitive electronic material to Iran, is released in Paris on a judge's decision.
The US Embassy, like many observers, questions this disturbing coincidence.
The expansion of Majid Khakavand is a bad news for Washington, who is tracking the Iranian underground procurement networks for the nuclear program.
Did France accept a marketing offer?
The release of Iran against the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier ensures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he said, not only "was completely surprised by the judge's decision", but sought to oppose it.
"There have been live exchanges between the French Presidency and the Guard of Sceaux" (at that time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot return to the decision" judicial, he observes.
Mr. Richier also wanted to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remained under the "strict" surveillance of French information services.
The adviser of the Elysée consists of a telephone number, which is cut off, and then informs the American diplomat that Iran "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not carry out its efforts, by means of communications and "flows" organized in the media, to make Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad believe that he plays an "important" and "influent" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and they find that manipulation bears its fruit as several press articles affect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 mentions "the media "blitz" of French officials."
What is the basis of so much "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris is being asked.
"Despite their full declaration of praise, French officials acknowledge in private that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then focuses on the reasons that led the Elysée to pay in this fiction.
The intensive communication effort "to validate Sarkozy's opening policy in Syria", he analysed.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was then perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and immemorial".
In "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris seeks "to demonstrate to Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The objective is also to "sow seeds of disagreement between Syria and Iran".
The American Embassy knows it's a good source.
On August 11, François Richier entrusted him with: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians did anything."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"That should at least sow the confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her from Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans last month
The South Korean government will adopt a "Cendrillon" law that will prohibit adolescents from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, reported government officials.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, young people under 16 years of age, have reported representatives of the ministries of culture and the family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the departmental head in charge of the bill.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the implementation of the law, has it specified.
The government also intends to ask companies to limit the daily time of access to these games for young people whose parents demand it, added the responsibility.
It will also make available to people who advertise free software that will limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the unmistakable champion of world games competitions online.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
Global 2018-2022: Fifa designates the host countries
In full because of suspicions of corruption, the Fifa Executive Committee is calling on the world Cup countries of 2018 and 2022 today, a highly political choice where influence and lobbying are at risk of taking action on technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the Queen of the Fifa competition will take place in Europe, traditional base of discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to acquire new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its deployment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that are part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch government leaders, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides the measure of the economic and political issues of a World.
Therefore, the treatment of strokes may last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the Fifa assessment report, the English, Hispano-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be too heavy for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, in the light of the revelations that led to the suspension for the corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the chances of his country, a football champion who accepted the World only once, in 1966.
The BBC released a layer, Monday, by distributing a documentary that spanned three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What makes Fifa unhappy and embarrassing English officials, who have been engaged in intense lobbying in the last few weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of the government hopes to re-edit the success of his predecessor Tony Blair, who in 2005 obtained the organization of the JO-2012 for London.
Will this intense activity be sufficient to reduce the blow of England to the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack anything with its already ready stages, its expertise (World-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its foot culture.
But the dark economic and financial perspectives of the two countries could be dwindling.
The possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase Russia's share, becoming a weightier despite the gaps in its record (states, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and denounced "devil competition in the preparation of the vote", in an illustrative allusion to the accusations of the English press against EC members.
"They're covered in mud, they're trying to compromise," said Mr. Putin.
For 2022, the United States, strong from the 1994 experience, appeared to be the logical favor.
First world economic power, seat of the main sponsors of the Fifa, the country seems to have a long advance on Japan and South Korea, which have built a very beautiful project separately.
But these new applications appear to be premature for two countries that co-organized the trial in 2002.
Another threat: the World 2026 award to China, strongly desired by the Fifa, which would make Asian chances for 2022 in fact run out.
With Qatar, which came out of the big game by offering futuristic stages, and Australia, Fifa would continue to expand to new contradictions, but these two countries are more at risk than certain ones.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of the TV rights achieved (due to the hourly decline) by the European countries, the nerve of the war for the Fifa.
Second mandate: evidence
De Gaulle was really reluctant.
Mitterrand had made him think he was shy.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac didn't have the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than them.
A warrant to the Elysée calls it another.
So the current head of state will be candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not make a good house with the part of the mystery attached to the presidential function.
So it has to be done as if there was always a doubt.
In a sense like in the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third mandate was not excluded.
On 15 November, with a heavy air, Nicolas Sarkozy would ensure that he would make his decision "in the fall of 2011".
That he calls in front of the UMP parliamentarians, Tuesday night at Elysée, the prospect of "two mandates" therefore had a bit of febrileity.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were far away.
The president only recalled that the 2008 constitutional review limited the number of five years to two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time that he calls the President on the tone of humor at such meetings.
"Unfortunately, or best of all, you've still been with me for seven and a half years," he launched them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't believe I don't think about the next step."
His earlier talk makes him no longer a candidate than a guard; they do not make him less.
If they make comments, it's for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race to the application to the PS, on the one hand.
But it's not Ségolène Royal's high school entry that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is because its 2012 candidacy is obvious that many in the PS are calling for an order of battle earlier than planned.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, right voters would prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46%) versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express.
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP above," the Prime Minister immediately responded.
"If he believes the possible defeat, he will not be a candidate," confides Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe that he can win," corrects Alain Juppe, renouncing the evidence.
Euro: The ECB is forced to maintain its acquisitions of State securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be an opportunity to clarify the way out of the crisis or, at least, to announce the conclusion of many of the non-conventional monetary policy operations that must be completed by the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis requires that the Frankfurt Institute of Emissions will certainly not be able to be as permanent as it is, in any case, to exacerbate a situation more than it is today in the European compulsory markets.
The political cost would be much higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
She did not want to say whether she believed that the central bank should do more, by increasing, for example, its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my reflection on my European partners (...)".
In Brussels, at the hearing of the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was no longer aware of his intentions, contenting to indicate that the State's securities purchase programme on the secondary market was "continued" and that "we will see what we will decide" at this Thursday's meeting.
Only certainty: the ECB will maintain its leading unchanged management rate at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchases of Treasury bonds by the ECB doubled over the last week, almost EUR 1.35 billion.
And, according to the indiscriminate market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem's central banks have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt that market operators are expected to continue their purchases (see page 29).
Economists no longer expect any significant change.
If lending operations of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter is still subject to unlimited liquidity allocations under generous conditions and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists today expect this device to be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine that she's making a significant change to her program."
"If not, it would be a risk to cause new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, an economist at the Commerzbank.
"A progressive release announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," anticipated by Norbert Brams, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
On the basis of its public debt market interventions, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these obligations to stimulate an atone market," Norbert Brams added.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It is necessary at any price to replace itself with the lack of investors in the market and to act in such a way as to prevent a package of performance paid by the most fragile States," testified an important compulsory manager yesterday.
For if interest rates are to fluctuate, the States will be even more inclined to reduce their tax burden, or stabilize it.
The saving of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government makes the back round
After a start of a worrying week for Italy, the situation was a little relaxed, yesterday, with the fall in mandatory rates at 10 years.
A safe return.
On leaving a meeting with the Minister of the Economy, the regional presidents said that Giulio Tremonti had heard that the situation was "indecipherable" and expected to be "unpredictable" for a weekend, which the interested party then denied.
On Tuesday in any case, the gap with the long German rates had reached the record of 210 basic points and the price of cover contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had been 263 points, leading to a certain blow to Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the difference with the German rates was above 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, declared himself "strongly concerned" by "market turbulence" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that she's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the athony of tax returns that goes with, making the State at risk of being unable to meet its funding needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts have been a cold shower for the government.
Italy's growth is now expected at 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the current Senate review budget is expected at 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission estimates that the public deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (as against 3.9% foreseen by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (as opposed to 2.7%).
As a result, the noise of a new budget collection that could be put in place after the festivals, for an amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be taken," said Commissioner for Economic Affairs Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The basics of his economy are in order and his accounts are good, we repeat it for a long time," says Arigo Sadun, the Italian administrator of the International Monetary Fund for Italy to the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate, short or long term, because despite its important debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), Italy's demand for stabilization efforts are less than those requested from other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The issue of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censorship in the House of Deputies, following which early elections could be held at the end of March.
A period of time would then be less conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde still martyred her yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I believe, have still demonstrated her on Sundays and at night, are obviously solid, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary area."
Although all related, yesterday's rest on European State obligations has brought water to the government's and the ECB's mill.
But we still cannot talk about a beginning of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's rating agency has announced that it could downgrade Portugal's debt note, the most targeted target today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs particularly on banking systems," says Exane BNP Paribas economists.
More and more, "political time is much slower than market time."
Conscious of this hiatus and of the dangers it poses, the European countries are intensifying the discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis devices.
Informal consultations between the ministers of finance most directly concerned and, more generally, with their G20 partners are going well.
This is also the case for meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the outcome of non-conventional support measures to euro area countries in the market-collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform the external-oriental investors of the crisis development in Europe.
If the objective of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first EDF securities issues are scheduled next month.
Yesterday, an official representative of the United States entrusted to the Reuters agency that the United States would support any increase in funds mobilized by an additional IMF direct commitment.
First of all, Portugal and Spain are keen to adopt structural reforms, including those relating to the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that add to closer austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to borrow a different path from those in Greece and Ireland.
Each and every one has to avoid seeking international assistance before establishing its own budgetary corrections and deciding on structural reforms necessary to restore lasting confidence.
Finally, European fund-raisers focus on the options available to speed up the process of standardising the markets of sovereign obligations.
In Paris, on 24 November, Axel Weber had first advanced the idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to hand over to the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, an actor of any first plan of the European sovereign debt market, believe that a round of about EUR 100 billion would suffice, "preference" in the form of a direct liquid injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism with EUR 60 billion to date.
An advice that has every chance of being carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and glass: 24 departments in orange surveillance
The snowy episodes are still causing traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Britain, and are likely to disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange surveillance due to the risk of snow and glass.
The Eure, the Eure and Loir, the Two-Sèvres and Vienna, have been added to the 20 departments already in orange surveillance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, later in the night.
According to Metéo France, sustained snowflakes affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it snows slightly on the Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, at a time of 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, up to 5 cm for the Parisian region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Low Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
Snowy episodes are notable enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, says Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments were prohibited from weighing more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
The traffic on the secondary network in Britain is very difficult, according to the gendarmies who recommend taking his vehicle only if necessary and the circulation of some TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transportation was banned for Thursday in Picardie.
No specific measure was envisaged on Wednesday night to limit heavy weight movement.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to the greatest caution on the roads and to adapt their conduct accordingly".
The Civil Aviation Directorate (DGAC) requested airlines to cancel their flights on Thursday 25 per cent of their flights to the Paris airport of Roissy and 10 per cent in Orly due to future snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Great Britain, Gatwick airport, south of London, and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France has been taking place, billions are flowing.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, we refer to 23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro which must build the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this SGP, the State announced a capital allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this amount will then allow the SGP to borrow on the markets part of the financing of its double loop.
Today, we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 Correctional Finance Act, which was reviewed by the National Assembly Finance Committee this morning, contains the arrangements to find the start of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in office tax in Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is said: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year."
The second is a reorganization of a fee on offices that already exists "to modernize, increase the product and to add this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much did that report?
Mystery.
This is not encrypted in the text.
We're far from the 4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of capital allocation that will be mobilised by the State and brought to the Grand Paris Society as a whole and as a measure of the project," can be read in the statement of reasons.
At the SGP, we can't find this shocking system.
"From the time of the creation of revenue (the two taxes, ndlr), studies over three years can be covered, then taped in the four billion after, let's explain."
"This will be included in the budget and taken into account and measured."
The GSP believes that the 4 billion will start to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This provision, in which the promised 4 billion are still to the missing subscribers, could cause a somewhat agitated parliamentary debate.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Avengers hackers and spies in diligence
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals a apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as a scandal before the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and prefigures a future dominated by regression.
But procedures by order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file consisting of a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations on Berlusconi's sexual habits only reported what could be read in any newspaper for months (except those that Berlusconi owns), and Khadafi's sadistic caricature profile has long been for sketch artists.
The rule that secret files should only be composed of known news is essential to the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that every book repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Temples or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the previous works.
And this is not only because the author of hidden texts does not like to do unpublished research (he does not know where to look for news about the nonexistent), but because those who want to see the occult believe only what they already know, and who confirms what they have already learned.
It's Dan Brown's mechanism of success.
I'm going for the secret files.
The informant is parable, and parable (or limited-minded) the head of secret services (unless it could be, I know, editor in Liberia), who do not believe in what he recognizes as true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy of Rome sent to the Department of State was the same as Newsweek published the previous week.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what any cultivated person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of World War II, and since the heads of state can call or take a plane to meet to dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representation exercises, have turned into espionage centers.
Any viewer of research films knows this very well, and it is only because of hypocrisy that we seem to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put America's diplomacy under poor light.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the world's most powerful country is a non-neglectable blow to the prestige of the Department of State.
Thus, the scandal does not cause both victims and "bottles."
But let us come to the profound nature of what has happened.
So, in Orwell's time, we could design anything power like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been completely fulfilled since, in order to control each movement by telephone, each transaction carried out, the hotel visited, the motorway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as it is now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least hacker - elected as the revenger of the citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true that Georg Simmel already said that a true secret is an empty secret (and the empty secret will never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, because it belongs to the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets meant to remove it.
WikiLeaks did no wrong in Sarkozy or Merkel, but made it too big in Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury caused by a very powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, the States will no longer be able to put any reserved information online - this would republish it on a display at the corner of the street.
But it is also obvious that with current technologies, it is necessary to expect to be able to maintain confidential reports by telephone.
Nothing easier than to find out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved reports be maintained in the future?
I am well aware that, for the moment, my prediction is based on science-fiction and is therefore Roman, but I am forced to imagine government officials who are discreetly moving in the care of uncontrollable routes, being only bearers of messages learned from the heart or, above all, by hiding the rare information written in a shoe's heel.
The information will be kept in a single copy in key-closed drawers: in the background, the Watergate's spying attempt has been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I've had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing now as a crab, that is to say, at rebounds.
A century after wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a telegraph on wire (telephones).
Videocassettes (analogic) have allowed cinema researchers to explore a film step by step, moving forward and backward and discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the CDs (numerics) only allow you to skip chapter, i.e. macroports.
With high speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on a plane, and the movements it includes need three and a half hours.
It is therefore only extraordinary that communications policy and techniques return to riding cars.
One last observation.
On the other hand, the press tried to understand what was being done in the ambassadors' secret.
Now, these are the embassies asking for confidential information to the press.
Climate: comment la France bidouille its financing promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine the implementation of the early-declared funding promises (such as fixed start or early funding) by developed countries.
And the great French bibliographies are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed themselves to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU came out with the big game to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fixed funding: a report detailing the action of its Member States, a press conference, a large side event, a brochure distribution...
The transparency operation is appreciated and appreciated at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announces spending €2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on the right track for compliance with its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at it in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen agreement, this money must be "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without damaging public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what it means "new and additional".
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States which France has blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission has considered 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years to fixed start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or in terms of public development aid.
On the contrary, France believes that the funding of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous years or to the overall level of public development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France's support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease) and it intends to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funding...
Another crucial element, the distribution of gifts and loans.
There again, there is no rule and everyone chooses their calculation mode.
Some, like France, consider that 1€ of loan is equal to 1€ given.
This is, of course, difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for some profitable investments (often projects related to the mitigation of emissions based on more efficient technologies), it is wrong to present a euro that is to be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given... Moreover, it should not be taken into account for its commitments than the cost of the loan for the loaning country (it is the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has such a reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to verify by yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use so massively the loan.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in other words) comply with their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the very large majority of the European Union puts 1€ to meet its commitment, France only makes 10 cents and considers the effort comparable.
Nice pass-by tour!
In summary, in its regular start-up funding, France is working on a double basis: on the one hand, on the other hand, on the evolution of the action in time and on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only EUR 36.1 million, it can be believed that it spends 420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy has done the arbitration) could have a double negative impact both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give if it is enough to borrow?) and in the negotiations as developing countries are not fully behind...
The early funding chapter is only a relatively short-term issue compared to the overall climate debate.
But it could be an extra sand grain in the huge machine that's the UNICEFC.
Let's hope that's not the case.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn lessons from this first year of early funding.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its accounting mode for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and equity with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could move forward discussions on long-term financing issues (another crucial chapter currently discussed): the issue of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans will not be avoided.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Koscisko-Morizet, who will arrive at Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about the firm start of France and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would be able to increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the discussions.
Alert to child-injurious pesticides
A 10-year-old child ingested 81 different chemicals in one day, according to a study published this Wednesday of the Association Generations Futures (ex-The Movement for Rights and Compliance of Future Generations).
The association, which predicts that its results "have no statistically significant value in terms of the small number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with", bought between July and September the food consumed in four meals and an encas in one day by a child of ten years, in the supermarkets of Oise and Paris.
These types of meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - were examined by laboratories for chemical, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The basis for the assessment is as follows: 81 chemical substances, 42 of which are classified as possible or probable cancers and five listed cancers, as well as 37 substances that can act as endocrine disruptors (PEs), according to studies of several institutions such as the International Research Centre for Cancer.
"Although, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, our investigation shows that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is worrying," notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible cancer residues and three averies such as certain cancers as well as close to twenty residues likely to disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, provided as an index by the study, presents traces of six chemicals, which are still banned by a fungicide in France.
Even for Kenya's green harecots, including in lunch, on which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the stick hooked, the tuna box, and even the bread bag and the Chewing Gum were hit by pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic seat used to warm up the food in the microwave was not exempt.
The final risk for the consumer of this "contaminants cocktails" is "probably underestimated", according to the study.
The Alliance of Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), on the other hand, proposed "face to the urgency of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop "the increase of civilization diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 were in cereals.
