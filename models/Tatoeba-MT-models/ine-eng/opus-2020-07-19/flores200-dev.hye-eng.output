"The secret painting system will certainly send a strong signal to these people working with animals, because their well-being is a top priority."
The International Map of Earthquake Research in the United States did not show any earthquake that took place in Iceland a week ago.
The Icelandic Aviation Agency has also reported that no earthquake has occurred in Hekla's area in the last 48 hours.
The sensitive earthquake, which caused a phase change, took place on the north-east side of the summit of the volcano in March 10.
It was reported that there were dark clouds at the bottom of the mountain that were not related to any volcanic activity.
The clouds were likely confused about whether it had happened in the actual storm.

The adjustment proposed in 2011 was accepted in both chambers.
This legislative amendment was made when the House of Representatives first deleted the second proposal, and then the Senate adopted it on a two-week basis.
The failure of the second decision, which suggests banning the civil marriage of homosexuals, may later open the doors of civil marriage.
Following that process together with two chambers, the 3rd sentence will be replaced by the next rule chosen or in 2015 or 2016 to continue the process.

Karno is very well known, but it's the opposite of English, who taught under the honor of Modern Education and the King, claiming that he had 9,000 students at the top of his career.
In his writings, he used words that some parents thought were angry and said that he had used complaints in class.
Modern education accuses him of putting on buses without permission a lot of advertising and lying, saying he's the principal teacher of English.
In the past, he was also accused of violating copyright, but there was no charge.
The former student said that he "was using his heritage in the classroom, teaching by observing and keeping himself just as a friend of the students."
Although China has remained officially a Communist state in the last three decades, it has developed a market economy.
The first economic improvements were made under the leadership of Deng Xaoping.
Since then, China's economy has increased 90 times.
For the first time last year, China has manufactured more cars than Germany and moved ahead from the United States as the largest market for this car industry.
In two decades, China's GDP may be bigger than the United States.
Daniel's solar storm, the fourth season of the 2010 Atlantic storms, was formed in the east of the Atlantic Ocean.
Potoric, located about 3,000 miles from the city of Miami in Florida, has a maximum of 40 miles/h (64 km/h) steady winds.
Scientists at the Potoric National Center predict that Danielle will be out of the blue until Wednesday.
Because the storm is far from money, it's still hard to appreciate its potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.
Bobek, born in Zagreeb, Croatia's capital city, was famous for playing in Belgrade's Parish.
He joined them in 1945 and remained until 1958.
During his time with Tim, he hit 403 goals in 468 talks.

The stars emit light and heat from the extraction of hydrogen atoms (or fusion) by forming more heavy elements together.
Scientists are working to create a reactor that will be able to get energy on the same path.
This, however, is a very difficult problem, and it will take years to see how useful assembly reactors are built.
The palm tree swims in the face of the water because of the pressure on the surface.
The pressure of the event is because the water molecules on the surface of the water are much closer to each other than the air molecules above them.
Water molecules create invisible layer of water on the surface, which allows things like this to swim in the face of water.
The layers of modern non-muscle designed for the ice have a double end, between which there is a gypsum, and the two ends allow better to hold from the ice, even when it's raining.
Because the bottom part of the tequila is a small loss, because the tequila is flowing this way or that side, the end of the ice is also going to disappear.
It doesn't have to turn the mouse. If the mouse moves to the right, the mouse moves to the right, and if the mouse moves to the left, the mouse moves to the left.
To get back to their previous energy level, they need to get rid of the extra energy they've got from the light.
They're doing it by displaying the smallest part of light called photo.
Scientists call this process "in the light-enhancing radiation," because the atoms are driven by the light-enhancing light, and the light is a kind of light-enhancing light.
The next picture shows how the atoms produce the photos, and of course, the photos are much smaller than they imagine.
The photons are even smaller than the material from which the atom is made.
After hundreds of hours of work, the lamp is finally lit and the lamp doesn't seem to work.
And then you have to change the electric lamp, and then you have to be careful when you change the lamp.
You need to turn off the light switch first or turn off the lamp.
It's because the electric power of the lamp that makes the input, where the metal part of the lamp is attached, can cause a strong electrical shock if you touch the inside of the lamp or the metal base of the lamp, while it's still inside the lamp.
The most important organ in the cardiovascular system is the heart that drives blood out.
Blood goes from the heart through the vessels called strokes and returns through the vessels called heart tumors.
The teeth of the triteratops would be able to break not only leaves, but even very narrow branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that the triterops ate peanuts that were typical of plants during the Ages.
These plants are like small roots, which have a sharp, rotten leaves at the top.
The giant dinosaur could use his strong coat to remove leaves before eating the plant.
Other scientists argue that these plants are very toxic, so it's unlikely that any dinosaurs would have eaten them, even though today they can eat poisonous leaves or fruit, such as peanuts and other mammals like this.
If you stand on Yo's surface, you'll have less weight than you do on Earth.
The man who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth is going to weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) on Yo. So, gravity certainly weighs less on you.
The sun does not have the outer surface on which to stand. The sun is made up of gases, fires, and plasma.
The gas gets deeper when you move from the center of the sun.
The outer part of the sun that we see is called the light bulb.
About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galileo used an asterisk and saw that Venus is like the moon.
The pulses follow each other, because only one side of Venus (or Moon) that looks at the sun is lit up, and Venus's phases support Copernicus' vision, because the planets are moving around the sun.
Then, a few years later, in 1639, an English astrologer named Jeremiah Horox noticed the transfer of Venus.

Hangul is the only specially created alphabet used on a daily basis. The alphabet was created in 1444 during King Sejung (1418 - 1450).
King Joson was the fourth king of the dynasty, and he was one of the most respected.
At first, he called Hanguel's alphabet Hanmi in Jonge, which means "the right sounds of teaching people."
There's a lot of theories about how Sanskrit came up. One of them is about migration from the west of Arians to India, which brought them into the language.
Sanskrit is the oldest language and is comparable to Latin spoken in Europe.
The earliest known book in the world was written by the Sanskrit, and after the creation of an order, the Sanskrit died simply because of the hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language that has served as a source for many Indian languages, as Latin is a source for European languages, such as French and Spanish.
After the war for France ended, Germany began preparing to invade the island of Britain.
The German attack code put "Operation Sea Lion." The British army lost most of the heavy weapons and supplies when it was evacuated from Denmark, so the army was too weak.
But the royal fleet was even stronger than the German fleet (Crygsmary), and could destroy any invading ship that had been sent through the English storm.
But very few of the royal ship's ships were located near the likely intrusion routes, because the sailors were afraid that they could be wrecked by a German air raid.
Let's start by explaining Italy's plans. Italy was mostly the "small brother" of Germany and Japan.
It had a weaker army and a weaker fleet, even though they had built four new ships before the war.
Italy's main goal was the African countries. To attract those countries, they needed a level of military action so that the armies could sail along the Mediterranean Sea and conquer Africa.
That's why they had to be freed from British troops and ships in Egypt, except for those actions, Italian fighters shouldn't have done anything else.
Now about Japan, it was a country on the island, like Britain.
Suzanne ships are designed for underwater voyages, and they stay there for a long time.
Suzanne was used in the first and second world wars, and at that time they were very slow and had a very limited distance to fire.
At the beginning of the war, they walked mostly across the sea, but along with the development of the radar and becoming more accurate, they had to avoid going under the water.
The Germans were called Yu ships, and the Germans were good at sailing and governing their submarines.
As a result of their success in Suzana, after the war, the Germans do not trust them to have much of it.
Yes, the king of Tutanhama, sometimes called Tut king or the King of the House, is now one of the most famous kings in ancient Egypt.
Interestingly, in ancient times, he was not considered very important, and there is no record of him on the list of many ancient kings.
However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him known, unlike the other ancient tombs that had been dug, this one was actually infallible.
Most of the items buried with Tutanhamen have been well preserved, including precious metals and thousands of historical objects made of rare stones.
The invention of free-wheeled wheels helped the Syrian cars to be lighter, faster and better prepared for the soldiers and other vehicles to run.
The arrows of their death arrows could hit the ranks of the opposing soldiers, and in about 1000 B.C.E., the Syrians presented the first rider.
The rider is a kind of force that fights on the horse, and the team has not yet been discovered, and that's why the Assyrian rider fought on the naked back of the horses.
We know a lot of Greek politicians, scientists and artists -- probably the most famous of these cultures is Homeros -- the famous blind poet who created the masterpieces of Greek literature -- the Illyan and Guided Pomens.

Pythagoras is another well-known Greek who is generally known for its well-known theory of relationships with the sides of equal triangles.
There are different estimates of how many people speak Hindi, and it's estimated to be the fourth most widely spoken language in the world.
The number of native languages varies depending on whether or not the non-directly related languages are counted.
The number of speakers is from 340 million to 500 million, and more than 800 million people can understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu are united from the point of view of vocabulary, but they are different in writing: in everyday conversations, speakers in two languages usually understand each other.
In about the 15th century, northern Estonia was under the powerful cultural influence of Germany.
Some Germans wanted the locals to be closer to God, so they invented a literary Estonian.
It was based on the German alphabet, and the label Õ/õ was added.
As time went by, many words that were translated from German came out, and this was the beginning of education.
After finishing high school, the heir to the throne must immediately pass through military service.

Turkey is surrounded by three seas -- the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean to the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but it gained independence in 1839.
Today's parts of Belgium were once part of Luxembourg, but then they became Belgians in the 1830s, after the Belgian revolution.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain neutral, but as in World War I, the World War II was attacked by Germany.
In 1957, Luxembourg became the main member of the organization that is now known as the European Union.
Druked Dzong is a destroyed fortress and Buddhist fortress in the upper part of Paro district (Fonday Village).
It's said that in 1649, Zebdrung Ngawang Namgiel founded the fortress to inspire his victory over the Tibetan forces.
In 1951, as a result of the fire, Drugel Yong left only a part of it, such as the image of the Shabdrung Ngawaang Namgagett.
After the fire, the fortress was preserved and protected, remaining one of Bhutan's most impressive sights.
In the 18th century, Cambodia was under pressure from its two powerful neighbours, Thailand and Vietnam.
In the 18th century, the Thais invaded Cambodia several times, and in 1772, they destroyed Phnom Fen.
In the last 18th century, Vietnamese have also invaded Cambodia.
Ten percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and many are employed in a non-official economy.
Two thirds of the working Venezuelans work in the field of service, almost one fourth work in the industrial field, and one fifth work in agriculture.
It's an important industry for Venezuela, an oil in which the country is just exporting, even though only one percent is working in the oil industry.

To create interactive media, you need conditional and traditional skills, as well as tools that are used in interactive classes (in images, audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.).
The interactive design requires you to rethink your assumptions about information creation and to think about non-linear ways.
In line with the demands of interactive design, the components of the program should be connected, but not inconceivable as a separate part.
The lack of increasing objects is the fact that the complexity of the focus lengths and the number of objects is far greater than the focus's permanent remote objects.
This becomes a less important problem, because opposition producers achieve higher standards in the field of this product.
This allowed a variable focus distance object to receive quality photos that are comparable to a fixed focus width of the object.
Another failure of the ascendant objects is that the maximum openness of the objects (mode) is usually lower.
This makes it difficult for non-precious opportunists to use light under low lighting conditions.
One of the most common problems with converting the film is the size of the image.
Most of the television is used to satisfy most of the public.
So all that you see on TV, there were limits to the top, the bottom, and the sides.
This is done to ensure that the image includes the entire screen. It's called the total.
Unfortunately, when you're making a DVD, it's probably going to cut its edges too, and if the captions of the video are very close to the bottom, they won't be completely visible.
The traditional medieval fortress has inspired people's imagination for years, enamored with the images of the Soviet manpowers, the typical dishes, and the king of Arthur.
Even standing in the thousands of years of ruins, it's easy to remember the sounds of long-standing battles and the flocks, to hear almost the sound of the shells of shellfishing and to take the herd of fear from the subterranean cracks.
But is our imagination really based on reality?
In time, the Kirby Muxlo fortress is a more well-established house than a real fortress.
Its large, glass windows and walls would not be able to withstand a decisive attack for a long time.
In the 1480s, when the building began by Lord Stings, the country was relatively peaceful and only needed protection from small band of knights.
Strong balance was a system in which European nations wanted to maintain the national self-government of all European states.
The view was that all European nations should strive not to let a nation become powerful, so national governments often change their plans to maintain balance.
The war for Spanish heritage marked the first war, the main problem of which was the balance of forces.
This has become an important change, because European forces will no longer have a source of religious wars, so the thirty-year war will be the last one to be destroyed as a religious one.
The temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21st, 356 B.C.E., as a result of a refurbishment by Jerome.
His enthusiasm, according to the story, was famous for any price. The offended Ephesians announced that the name of Herod would never be recorded.
Greek historian Strabon later named it, and here's how we know today, the temple was destroyed the same night that Alexander the Great was born.
As King Alexander offered to pay for the rebuilding of the temple, but his offer was rejected; later on, after Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.E.

To get an additional sound on the accodéon, you need to use the goofres at a faster or faster speed.
Counsel is to be the greatest reality, to be a God, to be a messenger of spiritual truth, to be acquainted with these things, or to be conscious of them.
The believer is looking for just experience, intuition, or understanding to divine reality, or gods.
Followers follow certain lifestyles or practices designed to develop these experiences.
Counsel can be distinguished from other forms of religious faith and worship because of its emphasis on the unique state of consciousness directly, on personal experience, in particular its peaceful, inspiring, blessed or even wonderful nature.
Sikhism is a religion from the Indian subcontinent, which originated in the 15th century as a result of the Hindu tradition of Hinduism.
The Sikhs consider their faith to be a separate religion from Hinduism, although they accept its Hindu roots and traditions.
The Sikhs are called the Gurmat religion, which is called the Guru Way. Guru is the fundamental aspect of all Indian religions, but Sikhism has gained importance, becoming the foundation of Sikh's beliefs.
The religion was founded by Guru Nanaka in the 15th century (1469-1539), and then there were nine more caves.

Indus Valley civilization was a Bronze Age civilization in the north-west of the Indian subcontinent, which includes most of today's Pakistan and some of its circuits in the north-west of India and in the north-east of Afghanistan.
The culture flourished in the rivers of the Indus River, and its name was derived from it.
Although some scientists believe that because civilization existed in the valley of the present-day Saravat valley, it should be appropriately called Indian-Sarasvatian civilization, and some refer to it as the Harapapa civilization, the first of which was destroyed in the 1920s.
The Roman Empire's military nature contributed to the development of medical advances.
The Emperor of August began to collect doctors and even created the first Roman medical corps to use for the consequences of the battles.
The surgeons had knowledge of various restorative drugs, including morphine from the morphine from the seeds of the applicant's seed and from the herb of the skopolamine.
They've been trained in decommissioning to save the patients from the radiation, as well as from the chains used to stop the flow of blood, and from the blood pressure.
For centuries, the Roman Empire has had great achievements in medicine and has shaped most of what we know today.
The Pyrland Origami is a regular limitation that can be carried out immediately only one layer, more complex layer, such as the opposite layer, is not allowed, and all layers are placed straight.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s, to help the inexperienced professionals and those with limited mobility.
Children are very young to form a perception of racial and racial prejudices, and these racial prejudices affect behavior.
For example, children with a racial minority label, who have a high-level or a low-school education, tend to be well-intentioned when they learn about a high-ranking low-school education.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States, and now it has 54 million users.
These sites have received great attention, especially in educational institutions.
These sites have positive aspects, which include easy-to-use settings that can include blogs, videos, photos, and other features.
This page can easily be accessed by providing only one website, which makes it easy for students who have difficulty using a logo or spelling.
It can be adapted so as to be easy to read, as well as any color preference.
Attention-centering disorder is "a psychological disorder whose class definition is three of the signs, including impulses, distortions and hyperactivity or excess energy."
It's not an inability to learn, it's an obstacle to learning -- it affects 3 to 5 percent of all children, probably about 2 million American children.
Children with a lack of attention are spending a lot of time focusing on things like schoolwork, but they can focus on things that are pleasing to them, such as playing games or watching their favorite movies, or writing presentations without posting.
These children tend to have problems because they are "integrated into risk actions, fall into battle and challenge the government" to stimulate their brains, because their brains cannot be moved by normal methods.
It's not about relationships with peers, because other children don't understand why they do that, or why they do that, or that they do that, or that their level of maturity is different.
As knowledge and learning skills have changed, as mentioned above, many new skills have changed.
The approach to getting information was different. The pressure was no longer dependent on the opinion of one person, and the ability to remember the text became more noticeable.
In fact, rebirth has made a significant change in the approach and dissemination of learning.
Unlike other primers, Homicides no longer use their hands when moving or hanging on trees or keeping their weight.
The hand and foot of the chimpanzee have the same size and length, which, when walking through the knees, reflects the use of the hand to keep the weight.
A man's hand is shorter than his feet, and the arms of his fingers are easier.
From two million to three million years ago, the bone of the hand of fuel shows a change in the specificity of the hand, from movement to movement.
Some people think that artificially created many gin dreams can be quite common in very tiring nature.
The main reason for this seems to be a long period of time between U.S. states as a result of simple dreams.
Having less sleep during the night in the process of dreaming, the state in which you're actually asleep and your body is being restored, becomes not enough to become a problem.
It's as tiring as if you woke up every twenty or thirty minutes and a TV diet.
The influence depends on how often your brain tries to dream consciously during the night.
In North America, almost the Italians were not doing well at the beginning. On June 10, 1940, when Italy declared war, the 11th British hopelessness in Libya attacked the Kapus fortress.
As a result of the warfare in the east of Barda, Britain has captured the chief commander of the tenth engineer of Italy, General Lastucci.

Maybe the most popular kind of holiday is what most people have to do with the holiday holiday that's going back to the rest of the world.
That's when people go to a place that's different from their normal everyday life to relax and have fun.
The spas, the thematic resorts, and the camp areas are the most frequently visited places for the treatment of tourists.
If the purpose of someone's visit is to get to know the history and culture there, then this kind of business is known as a cultural activity.
You can visit a country's many sights or just focus on only one area.
And the congregators, seeing this activity, also called for a combination of forces.
The front forces included the 1st and 3rd forces of 200 New Hampshire under the leadership of John Stark and James Reid (both became generals later).
The people of the rock took their positions at the northern end of the Colonist castle, along the plain.
When the lower slope opened the gap along the Mystic river, which is on the north-east of the peninsula, they quickly extended the valley to the north through a short stone wall, which ended up on the edge of a small pool.
Greedley or Stark set about 100 feet (30 m) high in front of the desert and ordered no one to fire until the regular forces passed it.
The American programme was based on the implementation of three different approaches.
General John Kedwalder was supposed to start a Diversio attack against the British Emperor in Bordentown to prevent any strength.

The main attack force, 2400 men, would cross the river from Trenton to the north, and then split into two groups, one under Green and one under Salvador, to start the attack by Monday.
If one fourth changes in half a mile, speed loses its importance, and endurance becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course, the main half-mile runner -- a man who can exceed two minutes -- must really be very fast, but endurance must be cultivated at all costs.
In winter, some of the obstacles to the body's upper body are considered the best preparation of the race.
Only the right diet can lead to excellent speech, but it can have a significant impact on the overall health of young professionals.

The charges can be purchased as needed, but most will have little or no effect on production.
Citizens can feel that they prefer any kind of commodity even if it doesn't really benefit them.
The atom can be considered one of the basic elements of the entire structure of the matter.
It's a very complex structure, which, according to the simple Bohry model, consists of a central nucleus that rotates by electrons, and what kind of planets orbit the sun.
The molecule is made up of two particles of neurons and protons.
The protons have a positive electrolyte, while the neurons have no electrolyte; the electrons have a negative electrolyte.
To check the victim, you first have to study the site to ensure your safety.

Participants require more support for pain from a negative perspective by distinguishing the differences between chronic pain and discomfort from normal physical movements.
The ability to see or see depends on the emotional organs or eyes of the visual system.
There's a lot of different structures in the eye that are different from their complexity, depending on the demands of the body.
Different structures have different possibilities, are sensitive to different wavelengths, and have different degrees of slope, and they also require different cultures to understand input data and that different numbers work optimally.
Population is a collection of special types of organisms in a geographic area.
When all people in one society are identical to a certain phenotypic quality, they're known as uniforms.

When the amount of food is reduced, the cave is spreading into the nucleus circle, and during this cycle, the cave is producing temporary plants that are changing every day.
Each one of these paints or tracks lasts about 17 days.
What's the cell? The cell word is derived from the Latin word Chella, which means "small room", and it was first discovered by a psychologist studying the structure of the cell.
The cell is the primary unit of all living organisms, and all organisms are made up of one or more cells.
Cells are so basic and important to life study that they are actually often called "the foundation of life."
The nervous system keeps homostases out of the body, sending nerve signals to keep the blood flow going.

The living creatures are in all the ends of the earth. They dig the earth, swim in the oceans, and fly in the sky.
The cell is the smallest structural and operational unit of the living organism.
The cell word comes from the Latin word nella, which means a small room.
If you look at the living creatures through a telescope, you'll see that they're made of small squares or cells.
English biologist Robert Huuk noticed small squares in the box.
They're like rooms, and he was the first to study dead cells.
Years and combinations can change and not change from one condition to another.
Like gas, the nitrogen has the same characteristics as liquid nitrogen, the liquid is thicker, but the molecules are the same.
The water is another example, the complex water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure, whether it's gas, liquid or solid.
Although its physical condition may change, the chemical composition remains the same.
Time is something that completely surrounds us and affects everything we do, but it's hard to understand.
For thousands of years, time has been studied by religious, philosophical, and academic scientists.
Our time is like a chain of events going from the future to the past.
We also use time to compare the length of events.
You can see the passage of time itself, following the cycle event -- the cycle event is something that happens again and again in a regular way.

During the 19th and 20th centuries, it was thought that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were Maori, who were engaged in a huge bird hunt called Moa.
And then the theory confirmed the idea that the Maoris, with the Great Navy, had fled Poland and been captured by New Zealand Moria, based on a rural society.
However, the new evidence shows that the Morivians were a group of mainland ants that landed on the islands of Chatham from New Zealand, developing their special, peaceful culture.
There was another tribe on the island of Chatham, the Maori tribe, who was buried in New Zealand.
They called themselves Morior, there were several military conflicts, and in the end the Moriors were destroyed.

When we hear people share their personal, family and organization stories, we have a valuable picture of their past and some of the personalities that have, in a bad way, influenced the culture of the organization.
If you understand someone's story, it doesn't assume that you understand culture, it at least helps people to feel that they're part of the organization's history.
By appreciating successes and by reporting failures, individuals and all the participants reveal the values of the organization, the sending and the moving forces.
In this case, recalling the previous events of business behavior and success, it helped people to open up to new changes and the new direction of the local church.
The stories of success have reduced the fear of change by creating positive attitudes towards future change.
The examples of thinking are ways of solving problems that combine different ideas or fields to find a solution.
This thinking is focused on speed, logic and accuracy, as well as on the equalization of the evidence, overhauling existing techniques and collecting information.
The most important factor in thinking is that there's only one correct answer; you're just thinking about two answers -- right or wrong.
This kind of thinking is related to some of the processes of scientists or sensors.
People with such thinking have rational thinking and are able to remember certain legal measures, solve problems and work on scientific tests.
People, of course, are the most ridiculous type of reading.
That means we can successfully predict what other people think, think about what they believe, know, or want.
The main thing about these abilities is to understand the intentions of others, and it allows you to solve the possible two-dimensionalities of physical activity.
For example, if you saw someone break the car window, you'd probably assume that he was trying to steal the unknown car.
He had to be washed differently if he had lost the keys to his car, and it was his own car that was trying to infiltrate.
The Magnissarsonal Surgery is based on a physical event called the Nuclear Magnesium (MRS), discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (worked at Stanford University) and by Ernest Percelle (worked at Harvard University).
During this resonance, the magnetic field and the radios make atoms produce the smallest radio signals.
In 1970, medical doctor and researcher Raymond Damadian discovered the grounds for the use of magnetic screening as a medical diagnosis tool.
Four years later, a script was given, which was the world's first written in the field of magnetic separatism.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the scans for the first "group body" that he called "uninterruptible."
