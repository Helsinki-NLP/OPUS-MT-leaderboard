AM in Wales is anxious to "go on as a puck"
Some AMs, members of the Wales National Assembly, are confused about a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Wales Parliament).
The proposal will be designed to change the name of the national assembly to the Wales Parliament.
AM all over the political spectrum is worried about being punished.
One AM for Labour said his group was worried because "it rumbles with Twp and Pwp".
For readers who can't walesic: Twp means stupid on walesic and pwp means bajs.
One AM for Plaid said that the group was generally "satisfied" and proposed other options.
A conservative waver said his group is "open" for the name change, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context, W is expressed in walesian equivalent letter U in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation on the name change, said: "The final decision on what members in the congregation are to be called is so clear to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Wales Congregation the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the outcome of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support for calling the assembly of the Wales Parliament.
The current title for AM was proposed by the Commission by Welsh Parliament Members (members of the Wales Parliament) or by WMP, but MWP received the highest support in a public consultation.
AM obviously proposes other options, but problems with reaching consensus may cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the amendment within a few weeks.
The legislative framework for the amendments also includes other amendments to the work of the assembly, including rules on the disqualification of an AM and the design of the Committee system.
AM is allowed to vote on what they should be called when they debate legislation.
Macedonia implements a referendum on the amendment of the name of the country
On Sunday, voters shall vote if they change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is an attempt to end a dispute that has been going on for decades with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim in its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempt to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the referendum on the name change and has said he will ignore the outcome.
But the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's silence when the churches in Harlem are in trouble
"The older people I speak to say that there was a bar and a church on every corner before," said Mr. Adams.
"Now there is neither or."
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
"People are being surrounded in other ways for the time being," he said.
"Bars are not like the living room of the area anymore, your people are on a regular basis."
He is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not be sufficient as the leaders expect and that "before or after they arrive on the route again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartments with apartments filled with people who do not help the remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people buying apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually lead to the closure of all churches, because those who move into the apartments will probably not become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist Assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation with a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or move black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when pastor Johnson's assembly planned the renovation they also built the clock.
Pastor David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the music for the "poor watches".
The expert who played the watch game in July had another name for it: "A cultural tax" and "an indispensable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first watch played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the larger watch in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
The events of the last few months at St. Martin's are a complicated story with architects and entrepreneurs – some who were hired by the church's toys, others of the episcopal foundation.
The Church Assembly – the governing body of the congregation consisting of members – wrote to the Foundation in July and expressed concern that the Foundation would "try to transfer the cost" to the Church Assembly, even though the Church Assembly had not been involved when the Foundation hired architects and entrepreneurs.
Some members of the congregation complained about a lack of transparency from the foundation.
Haj harms 13-year-olds who dive after lobsters in California
On Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who covered for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack took place right before seven in the morning, near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and packed there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought the boy was just glad to have found a lobster, but then he realized that the boy shouted, "I've been bitten!"
"I've been bitten!"
When Hammel came to the boy, he noticed that the whole bone had been removed.
"I called out to everyone to get out of the water. 'There's a shark in the water!' said Hammel.
The boy was flew to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego and his condition is indicated to be critical.
It's not clear which shark it was.
Bathrobe Larry Giles told the media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim had trauma damage on his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's joins Britain's beauty market
Sainsbury's takes on Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with similar beauty walks with beauty specialists.
As part of a significant push into the UK’s beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the fall of the fashion and household market, the major beauty events will be tested in 11 stores across the country and implemented in more shops next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the quick purchase attempt to fill the boxes previously taken up by TV devices, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's said they're going to double their beauty offer to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing offers from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get larger space with selected areas, as in stores such as Boots.
The shop chain also launches its boutique brand again so that most of the products are vegan – as many young customers require.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test the condition in two Sainsbury's shops – the first condition opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the second will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend to buy smaller quantities of food every day in local stores means that fast shopping needs to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their stores will look more and more like a shop in an attempt to fight cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl with more services and other products than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos stand in hundreds of shops and has also obtained a number of Habitats stand since they bought both chains two years ago, which they believe has increased the sales of food and made the acquisition more profitable.
The early attempts of the purchase to give the beauty and pharmacy departments a face lift failed.
Sainsbury's tested cooperation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation ended after a dispute about how the revenues from Boots' sales in the fast purchases would be distributed.
The new strategy will come after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, who owns Lloyd's Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
They claim that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxurious skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial boss, said: "We have given our beauty walks a new appearance and a new feeling to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can advise customers.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all needs, and with an attractive environment in slippery places, we are now a fascinating destination of beauty that challenges the old way to shop."
Peter Jones "breathing" after Holly Willoughby withdraws £11 million
Dragons The Star Peter Jones is "breathing" that the TV representative Holly Willoughby withdraws from a deal of £11 million with his lifestyle to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't bother with their brand True, with leisure clothes and accessories.
Their activities have been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This morning representative, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons The Star Peter Jones angry by withdrawing from their luxurious lifestyle in the last minute – to focus on their new agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became "racing" at an exciting meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when the TV favorite admitted that her new contract – worth up to £1.5 million – meant that she no longer focused on their brand True, with leisure clothes and accessories.
The activity has been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated assets of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced that she was leaving True on Instagram, Jones flew to one of his holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was clearly Holly's top priority.
It would be her long-term future for the next decades.
Her decision to withdraw shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe it happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold in Marlow's headquarters."
Experts believe that this morning representative’s decision to withdraw may cost the company several million because of considerable investments in everything from pillows and light to clothing and the risk of further delays in the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
My cousin Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started True with Capp 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role as president in March.
The couple travel together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production companies.
Willoughby will be a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host to "I'm a Celebrity" on ITV.
A source near Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business."
Hard talk "and then we're in love"
He complained that the media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider to be "unworthy a president" and that he was so positive about North Korea's leaders.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a novelty voice:
"I haven't given up anything."
He said Kim wanted a second meeting after Trump celebrated their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear destruction.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have taken place.
More than three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "consistent response" from the United States after the first nuclear strike in North Korea.
He noted that, instead, the United States continues sanctions designed to maintain the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his followers.
"It's going great with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a sovereign relationship."
He said his attempt to improve the relationship with Kim has had positive results – an end to rockets, free hostages and returned remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this packed arena, we would have about 200 people here," Trump said and pointed to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy the island of Indonesia, hundreds of deaths
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the Lomboks population had lost their homes, an exception was not granted, which is necessary for international assistance.
"In many cases they have been very clear that they do not ask for international help, which complicates it all," said Ms. Sumbung.
Saving children gathers a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear whether foreign personnel can work there.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson for the Bureau of Natural Disasters, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu in order to decide whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the assistance work.
In view of Indonesia’s constant earthquakes, the country is still desperately unprepared for the wrath of nature.
It's built in Aceh, but they're rare on other coastlines.
The absence of a soundproofing siren in Palu, although a warning had been issued, likely contributed to the loss of life.
Even under perfect conditions, it is a challenge to travel between many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters complicate the logistics further.
A hospital ship that has been established in Lombok to deal with earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on the promises to improve Indonesia's worn infrastructure in his campaign and has spent large sums on roads and rails.
But lack of funding has plagued Mr. Joko's administration before the next year's election.
Mr. Joko is also pressed by prolonged sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge tweeted in the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a goal in 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal when his team was behind with 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and scooped a kick at the far pole.
The attempt flew high over the target area towards the top right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball fell over the hope of Kepa Arrizabalagas and got online.
"I was just trying to get in a position to get to the ball and players that Shaq always plays forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante getting closer and didn't think so much about it, but just threw it away."
Chelsea led with 1-0 after the first half after a target in the 25th minute from the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker held a pass back to Mateo Kovacic, stretched from close to the midfield and sprinted to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go at the middle field.
Then he got a sovereign kick that brought Hazard into the target area.
Hazard ran away from the defense and got the ball in the net at the far pole with a left-shot kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights with Naples in the Champions League group stage at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy at 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday.
Chelsea is facing videoton in Uefa Europa League at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday.
The number of tsunamis in Indonesia rises to 832
The death rate for the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country’s disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people were reported to have stuck in the ruins of buildings that collapsed in the earthquake of 7.5 that hit in Friday and triggered waves up to six meters, said the bureau’s spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of broken buildings.
Police arrested, 32, suspected of murder after the woman was killed

The police have asked people in the area who saw or heard anything coming forward.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said, "We're in an early stage of the investigation, but I'm asking everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious about contacting us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera to contact us because they can have information that is crucial to our investigation."
A spokesperson for the police has confirmed that the woman found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
During the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the place to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police inform the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but the police said no one can get into or out of the building.
He became aimless when he found out what had happened.
The residents of the building have been informed that it will take several hours before they can come back in.
A police officer told a man that the whole area was treated as a crime scene.

Parliament's statue of Cromwell's latest victims of the rewriting of history
A banishment would be poetic justice for his talisman destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal for "grass" and "try to write about history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be drawn into the ongoing debate on the removal of statues."
The iconoclass during the English civil war was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Fel Cromwell might have been offered for what his ancestor Thomas did 100 years ago.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the opinion of the 1800s and is part of the history of a man who many believe should still be praised.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more at the end of the 1800s than now, believes that Cromwell defended Parliament against pressure, in his case from the monarchy.
If this is a correct representation, it is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict in the mid-1900s has undoubtedly affected the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person who represents one side of the matter.
His businesses as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated.
Murdering pig kills peasants.
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, only identified with his last name Yuan, was found dead with a brusque artery and covered in blood in a market stop in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig breeder prepares to inject a pig vaccine in pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He is reported to have been traveling with his cousin from the province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The morning after that, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a pigs ’ nest nearby was open.
He said there was a big grayish in the pig's face with blood on his mouth.
A legal investigation confirmed that the 250 - pound - weight pig had killed the farm, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and distorted," said the cousin identified by the last name Wu to Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig who killed the farm didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to avoid more attacks while the police collected evidence on the spot.
The Yuan's family and market leaders are reported to negotiate compensation for his death.
It's rare that pigs attack people, but it's happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts and seriously injured the man.
Ten years ago, a 300 - pound [300 kg] pig pressed a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012 a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can work as a "catalyser".
"They're just playful.
They're naphtha and they're very curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect," he said.
The rest of the hurricane Rosa for extensive heavy rain to the south-west USA
As expected, the Orkan Rosa becomes weaker when it travels over the softer water at the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring rain to the north of Mexico and the south of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind strength of up to 135 km/h, category 1, at five o'clock on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
In time, a stretch begins to form over the Pacific and travel east towards the western coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture north into the south-western United States.
Rosa will carry up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that interacts with the nearby grass will create vastly strong rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, clay flow and possibly soil in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to 5–7.5 cm rain per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5-10 cm of rain is expected in some places in the South-West USA, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the widespread tropical rain.
It is certainly not recommended that anyone go out in the desert to foot when tropical rain is expected.
Powerful rain can make canyons for sending rivers and storms lead to strong local winds that blow around sand.
The nearby grass with it seems to be a local strong rain to parts of the southern California coastline.
It is possible with a total of over one cm of rain, which can lead to clay flow and huddle roads.
This would be the first rain in the area during the rainy period.
Some snowy tropical rains will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday before the rain becomes more extensive later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October may mean intense temperature changes throughout the United States, when the Arctic is cooled down but the tropicals remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic short-range temperature changes.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in Central America on Sunday.
It is almost ten degrees apart from Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
During the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of Central and Eastern USA are expected to get a warm start in October with about 30 degrees from Great Plains to parts of the North-East USA.
New York can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about five degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a great chance of warmer temperatures than the average in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million watched Brett Kavanaugh's interview
More than 20 million were looking at Brett Kavanaugh's arrest case, which was nominated to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault that was due to take place in the 1980s, on sex TV networks.
During the time, the political situation continued and the normal broadcast was interrupted for the last minute of Friday – Senator Arizona’s Jeff Flakes’ agreement with the FBI, where they were able to investigate the charge for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh had lost her when he was full and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate witness and said he's absolutely sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers in Friday was higher than the 20.4 million indicated by Nielsen.
They calculated the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other TV networks that showed the interview, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble counting people looking from the office.
Comparably, there are as many spectators as for a football match in the final game or Oscarsgalan.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown strong support for Kavanaugh's nomination, had most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day-long hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC had nearly 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still high after the hearing.
Flake was in focus during Friday's drama.
After the Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh filmed CNN and CBS demonstrators who shouted at him when he tried to take a lift to a hearing with the Judicial Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes while the demonstrators shouted at him, which was shown in direct transmission by CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
Do you think he will tell the truth about the land?"
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors were closed, he said he would have more to say after the committee's hearing.
The TV networks sent live several hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted if they would carry on the Kavanaugh nomination to a vote with the whole Senate.
But Flake said that he was only going to do it if the FBI were to investigate the charges against the nominee in the coming week, which the minority Democrats have been calling for.
Flake was partly convinced by his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators later, Flake took his decision.
Flake's decision had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political players" around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political games" about Britain's future and undermine the nation's interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the paper, her previous foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that the proposal that the UK and the EU should collect each other's customs duties was "fullly unreasonable".
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect for shooting Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and arrested for murder, said the police in Baton Rouge.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
The police found the glasses on the spot and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After the interview with Simpson, the police said he recognized that he killed Wayde.
His debt was set at $350,000, according to the Attorney.
The doctor in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a bullet in the head and neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police Space Action Force, police state law firm, South University police and residents in the area of assistance with the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "flight and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98 feet long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played the basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "crossed" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"You're worried about this all the time," Wade said.
The volcano asks ash over Mexico City
Aska from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern part of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity had been detected in the crater and the recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash over the course of 24 hours.
The center discovered several women and shells.
Pictures on social media showed thin layers of ash on windmills in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have noted increased activity in the volcano, which is 72 km south-east of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police are dealing with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence demonstrators were involved with the army police while thousands of people participated in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalonia's polarising vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists who were kept back by the warehousing police threw eggs and colored powder on them, leading to dark dust in streets that are usually full of tourists.
Killers also broke out later during the day and cops used their batons to stop them.
For several hours the independence groups called "never forget, never forgive" while the unionists called "long life Spain".
14 persons were treated for minor damage caused by the protests, according to local press.
The vote is still tense in the region, which longs for independence one year after the first October referendum, which was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
An overwhelming majority voted for independence, but the participation was low when most of those against the section boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when the police tried to stop the vote by the countries in the region.
Self-reliance groups camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration still took place, but it was forced to take another route.
Electric Narcis Termes, 68, participated in the separatists' protest with his wife and said he no longer believed that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy to be able to vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal gain in regional elections in December, Catalan parties that are for independence have found it difficult to maintain their driving power up to this year, as many of their most well-known leaders live in self-held exile or are awaiting their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protests in support of the police on his cell phone, said that the conflict had been fired by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more exciting," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been arrested since the end of last year, announced that he was going to run for the European Parliament's election next year.
"Courseing the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the subjugation we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men grab after driving a car into the house
Three men — 33, 34 and 39 — have been arrested after driving a car into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
An armrest may also have been fired against the car.
Add Livingston 1-0 to Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured profit
Livingstone shocked Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss of 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's strike turned out to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was shared two with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's side has still not received an outturn in Premiership this season and meets Hearts, with eight points more, next Sunday.
Before it welcomes Rangers Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Thursday.
Livingston extends his winning line to six matches – Master Coach Holt has still not experienced a loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances against cross-visitors
Holt's law should have taken the lead long before they did goals; their justice gave Rangers all possible problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but threw his performance across the target, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot the level after he slipped in to measure Craig Halket's nibbling across the target.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, when they knew they could attack in certain games.
And that's how the decisive goal was made.
Rangers gave up a fresh park and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to give Menga a chance, which made targets from the middle of the target area.
In that situation, Rangers had dominated the ball, but the defense of the household was unbearable and the target guard Liam Kelly was largely left in peace.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Ranger's target guard Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot wide from another certain game by Livingstone.
The crossings were constantly entering the target area of Livingston and handled without any problems. Two criminal charges – after Halket's challenge by the dealer Glenn Middleton and one for hands – were dismissed.
Livingston's Phenomenal – Analysis
BBC Scotlands Alaskar Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and results for Livingston.
Each one was outstanding and continues to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their game style and staff have barely changed since they returned to the top level, but Holt deserves the honor of having galvanized the team since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a well-organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the whole voltage right through.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've had their moments under Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball didn't keep it – they just opened the home page once – and it's one of the alarm clocks for Rangers, located in the middle.
Erdogan gets a mixed welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, on the occasion of the occasion of the meeting in Berlin, Turkey’s and Germany’s leaders offered a smile and a blue sky (29 September).
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – to repair the relationship between NATO allies.
They have become united over human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside Turkey.
The police claimed that they prevented 25 000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurdish – also heard their voices and condemned both Erdogan's police and the German government's decision to welcome him to Germany.
The duplicating protests show the split views of a visitor who is considered to be a hero of certain German Turks and condemned as a bully of others.

Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Damaged in Tumult
Six prison guards have been injured in anxiety of a high-security prison for men, according to Prison Office.
The riots broke out on the HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and is still going on.
Specialized "tornadawatts" have been called there to deal with the concerns, involving eight prisoners on a plane.
The guards were treated on site for minor damage to the face.
One spokesperson for Prison Service said: "The specially trained prison staff have been sent there to handle the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those behind this will be linked to the police and may receive increased prison sentences."
HMP Long Lartin accommodates over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the director of the prison was treated at the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, he was called a police officer to the prison to deal with serious concerns where personnel were attacked with billiards.
Orkanen Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (dry areas can benefit)
It is rare that tropical low pressures reach Arizona, but that is exactly what will happen at the beginning of the next week when the energy of the hurricane Rosa is rising above the desert in the South-West United States, with the risk of sudden flooding.
National Weather Service has already issued alerts for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into south and east Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and bring rain late on Monday.
National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained status as a tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km from Arizona border".
The National Hurricane Center's latest models predict 5–10 cm of rain, with isolated quantities up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the South-West USA, including central Klippiga mountains and Great Basin, are likely to rain 2.5 to 5 cm with a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas where there is no risk of sudden flooding, Rosa rain may be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Floods are very serious, but some of the rain will probably be useful because the South-West United States is suffering from drought.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the next highest category reported weather.com.
Orkanen Rosa will first travel across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still with energy in the morning with maximum wind strength of 135 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is traveling north for 20 km/h.
The storm blows on softer waters in the Pacific, which calms it down.
It is therefore expected to reach the Mexican countryside as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico can get heavy rain, which is a significant risk of flooding.
"Total 7,5–15 cm rain is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm", weather.com reported.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm and reach Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then be traveled through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The biggest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very strong rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert in the southwestern United States," said the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and floods in the desert, as well as earthquakes in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three boys in their teens and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and the situation is reported to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, two- 18-year-old, and a 20-year-old caught up in the Radstock area at night, said the police in Avon and Somerset.
The police ask anyone who can have filmed what happened to the cell phone to step forward.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "led, wickedness, anger" from the democratic party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the lack of consideration and scandalous tactics of the democratic party," Trump told his supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had "suffered by the evil, the evil" of the democratic party during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed in front of the assembly on Thursday, and firmly and emotionally refused Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he had committed sexual assault on her several decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified in front of the congress about his accusation.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliant and the quality and the courage" at Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most practical legal meanings of our times, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public," he told his followers in the audience in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm running," he said.
"That's why I go around and fight for sovereign candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are trying to "stand up and prevent".
The first decisive vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place on Friday, according to information to the CNN from an assistant to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia, number of increases
At least 384 people died, many were drowned when giant waves broke down against the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities of Saturday.
Hundreds of people had been gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu on Friday when up to six meters of high waves crashed against the beach in the cloud and drowned many into a safe death and destroyed everything in its path.
Tsunamin came after an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami alert came yesterday, people stayed on the beach instead of running away immediately, and they fell victim to the tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian disaster agency BNPB, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"Tsunamin was not alone but dragged cars, tanks and houses with it. It hit everything in its path," Nugroho said. He also said that Tsunamin had been travelling on the open sea for up to 800 km/h before the affected coastline.
Some climbed up trees to get away from the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
Fly photos released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, brothers are confused and have collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
After-skull still hit the coastal town on Saturday.
The range of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology BPPT said in a statement that the amount of energy released in the huge earthquake in Friday was 200 times as large as the nuclear bomb released at Hiroshima in the second world war.
The city is at the end of a long, narrow arc, which may have made tsunamin larger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the destruction as "beneficial" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found under the edge of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and the damage could be even worse along the coast line 300 km north of Palu, an area called Dongala, which is the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication from Dongalla "was completely paralyzed without any information," Nugroho said.
"It lives over 300,000 people there," said the Red Cross in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," they said.
The Agency was criticised on Saturday for not being informed that Tsunamin had attacked Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had appeared within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top of a building is heard screaming frenetic warnings about tsunamin to people on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water breaks down against the beach and sweeps out buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a widespread power failure that interrupted all communications around Palu, making saving work difficult for the authorities.
The military has begun sending your cargo flights with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated people are still in great need of food and other necessities.
The airport has been opened for assistance and remains closed for other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in tsunamis in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Co-workers from World Vision in Dongala have gone to Palu where they seek protection during presentations on the farm outside the office, but they saw pollution along the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw many ruined houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Aid groups have begun the clear aid work, but some complain that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staff from abroad may only be used if an exemption permit is issued after a disaster.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the authorities say it is a national disaster, we can release international aid, but that status has not yet been resolved."
When the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunamis, relatives and friends of missing persons were still hoping that their closeness and love would prove to be the miracles that shed light on the dark natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a clown.
On Sunday, the rescue workers rescued a woman who had been stuck under a brow for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, Indonesia's national flight coach, had trained two of the missing aircraft in front of the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were stuck at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As the flight attendant, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us that the hours after the screenshots heard that Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he sent whatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages only got a grey box, instead of two blues.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26,750 under ATM refill at Newport on the Livee
On Friday morning, the thief stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who filled a ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The driver had emptied a ATM in the entertainment facility and would deliver more money, said criminal Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While he was busy "a second man jumped up behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that would be delivered.
The witness saw several suspected flights from the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many were involved in the incident.
All who have information about the identity of the trainees shall contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The Rapper renames to Ye
The Rapper Kanye West changes name – to Ye.
He announced the name change on Twitter on Saturday and said, "The thing that is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41,has been called Ye for a longer time and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new Yandhi album.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande in the program, which he introduced for "sensitive reasons" according to the programme's creator.
Ye is abbreviation of the current professional name of the West, but he has also said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year when he spoke about the title of his album with the radio values Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means 'the only', to just Ye – a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a mirror of who we are."
He's one of a number of known rappers who's changed names.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously collaborated with the West, has previously written his name with and without ties and verses.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obador has promised never to use the military against civilians now that the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody revenge against students.
Lopez Obador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Troops fired weapons against a peaceful demonstration at the square on October 2, 1968 and killed up to 600 people during a period of left-wing student movements in Latin America.
Lopez Obador has vowed to support young Mexicans with monthly contributions to students and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups.
USA should double AI funding
Now that China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the USA should double the amount they spend on research in the field, according to the inventor and the AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment will follow that several parts of the US government have made statements about AI, despite the fact that the US does not have a comprehensive formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the goal of becoming leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
A double budget can double the chance for the next big AI-break in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was previously published in the month of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies – Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-ranked U.S. Othello player, and later he was in charge of Microsoft Research and was CEO of Google's China Department.
Lee mentioned earlier technology competitions from the U.S. government, such as Robot Challenge from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what would be next in order to identify future visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders from us, but the companies," Lee said.
In recent years Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed leading personalities from universities to work on AI.
Lee said that new immigration policies can also help the USA with AI innovation.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctoral students in AI," he said.
State Council in China issued its development plan for next generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation grants funding to people in academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Defence Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF is currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
American legislation that would create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not made any progress in several months.
Macedonia's referendum on the name change
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on the name of the country to be changed to "the Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece that has prevented the country from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that its name in the north constitutes a requirement in its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the name change would undermine the identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has led to doubt as to the minimum participation of 50 per cent required for the vote to be considered valid.
The question of the ballot in the referendum is: "Are you for membership in NATO and the EU with the approval of the agreement with Greece?"
But the followers of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is worth changing names if it makes Macedonia, one of the countries that was formed when Yugoslavia was split, can join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough Members in Parliament have said that they intend to follow the outcome for it to be considered crucial.
The name change requires a majority of two thirds of Parliament.
According to the State Election Commission, no irregularities had been reported at 13.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"For the sake of my children, we belong to Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in the referendum in Macedonia on the country's name change, which would open the way for membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Outside the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a small stage and set up chairs in front of the tent that has been set up by those who boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go with our head in the air, not sneak in through the back door," Kavardarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of a Euro-Asian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership would lead to adequate investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment of more than 20 per cent.
"I think the absolute majority will vote yes, because more than 80% of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said when he voted.
He said that a "Yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Investigation, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters voted in the referendum, which falls below the minimum participation required.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 per cent of the participants planned to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them were going to vote.
In order to count the referendum, 50 per cent of registered voters plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious step towards the policy of the Western Government since it took over in May last year.
Look at: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero takes over the whole of Brighton's defense to make goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's win at 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero got it to look ridiculously simple when he made goals in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a pass from the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between the three of Brighton's defenders and went out on the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green trees.
He went around a defendant and ran away from several others at the edge of Brighton's target area.
Then he pushed a pass to Sterling on the left.
The English advance used its first shot in the target area to return the ball to Aguero, who used the right foot to hit Brighton's target guard Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the network.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," said City's manager Pep Guardiola to the journalists.
"We talked about him playing for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he made a target at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial takeover in the Premier League struggle.
The target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside of Brighton's book on that game.
He sent out a nice kick along the left side of Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of kicks and led Sterling to the far pole.
Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net at the moment before it got out of range.
City meets Hoppenheim in the team game at the Champions League at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies
Nationals have been eliminated from the final game, so there was no reason to force one to start.
But racing-oriented Scherzer wants to throw on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only about Rockies, which is a match before Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, still has a chance to finish the game.
Rockies got a wild card slot with a win of 5-2 over Nationals on Friday night, but is still out after its first division title.
"We play about nothing, but we can get a chance to chew rubber in knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the second layer would play at a higher level than any other team I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be there?"
Nationals have not yet announced their launch on Sunday, but according to reports, they are looking at letting Scherzer throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, heated up in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest day.
Washington's right-hand castter is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 in this season.
Trump is talking in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of Republicans voting in the forthcoming mid-term elections.
"Everything we have done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not running, but I'm running. That's why I'm going around and fighting for sovereign candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see a terrible, terrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happening here and now.
They are determined to take back power whatever is required, you see their wickedness, their horror.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take over power and control. That's what they want, power and control. We won't let them get it."
Democrats, he said, are fighting to "stand up and stop".
"You've seen it in the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "angrily and evil and terrible and false."
He mentioned democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, who is sitting in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was confronted by a high degree of bias from the audiences.
"Do you remember what she said?
"Did you close the document?"
'Eh, uh, huh?
No, no, no, I'm waiting for a... 'It was really bad body language, one of the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They don't tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I'm the last in a series of MPs from Labour to hear that we're not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament Joan Ryan was treated similarly when she was against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticised for not keeping with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on the security of the nation, on Europe – ironically much like Jeremy criticised previous leaders.
In the statement on the meeting with Nottingham East Labour on Friday it was said that "we want the meetings to be welcome and productive".
During most of my eight years as Labour's local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been exactly that.
But now, unfortunately, many meetings are not, and the promise of "more friendly, more careful" policy has been forgotten long ago, if it ever started.
It has become increasingly evident that divergent views are not tolerated within Labour, and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether the party's leaders accept it.
This began immediately after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues I previously thought had a similar political view that I expected me to make a full reversal and take positions that I would never otherwise have supported – whether it was the security of the nation or the EU's internal market.
Every time I speak publicly – and it really doesn’t matter what I say – a tiad of the ovet on social media demands that I be postponed, criticises the middle policy and says that I shouldn’t even be in Labour.
And this isn't just killing me.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the professionality and determination of these colleagues when they are faced with a stream of seismic and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the biggest disappointments with this policy of yours is the level of insults now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour would promote a culture of tolerance.
But in reality, we are no longer this broad church, and with every mistrustful and change in the rules of choice, the party is becoming increasingly narrower.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years about flying under the radar and not being too straight, so "it's okay."
But that's not why I became a politician.
Ever since I joined Labour as a school student 32 years ago, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which literally got my elementary school classroom to collapse, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – both at local level and as government ministers.
I have never concealed my political views, and that includes the last choice.
No one in Nottingham East may have been confused by my views on policies and topics where I do not agree with the current leadership.
To you who promoted the profession this Friday, I just want to say that when the country goes against a Brexit that will damage households, businesses and public services, I do not understand why anyone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour's party leaders.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency – both Labour members and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats to abandon me or political comfort will prevent me from doing what I think is best for you all.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Oslagna Ayr on top
Two trials in the last minute may have distorted the outcome of an idea, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderful entertainment Tennent's Premiership match.
They're on top now, the only unbeatable side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, which gave the housekeeper the benefit, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested under our matches so far and are still unsatisfied, so we are so happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead but a yellow card to Captain Rory Hughes of Scotland, who was released by Warriors for the match, let Melrose let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot did an unconverted attempt.
Climo expanded Ayr's line with a penalty, and at the end of the first half, he scored and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a line of 17-5 in the break.
But Melrose got a good start on the other half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
It was then a long wait for a serious damage to Ruarid Knott, which was cut off by the plan, and after the restart, Ayr's leadership increased again with a trial by Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting Captain Blair MacPherson then got a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of intense pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to hit Climo without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the penalty line-out behind Ayr's maul.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after restarting, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent away the flag Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt of the household.
Still the Game star seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still the game star Ford Kiernan seems ready to join the restaurant industry after it has been discovered that he has been identified as the CEO of a licensed restaurant activity.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays together with his long-lasting comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Duon has announced that the next nine seasons will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to plan for life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, he is the CEO of the Adriing Morn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but a source on the Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan wanted to join the Glasgow "flowering restaurant industry".
"The sea belongs to us": Coastal Bolivia hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific again
Seamen patrol a rigged headquarters for the fleet in La Paz.
Public buildings have a sea blue flag.
The fleet's bases from the Titicacas Sea to the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea belongs to us.
It's our duty to recover it."
In the coastless Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict of the 1800s is still strong – and it is also the desire to sail again on the Pacific Sea.
This hope is higher than for decades now when Bolivia expects a decision from the International Court of Justice on the first October, after five years' consideration.
"Bolivia has the operation, a mood of unity and peace, and expects so clearly the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decisions of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will judge in favour of Bolivia's demands that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, have to negotiate with Bolivia to allow them to leave the sea.
The lunch's decision is also of great importance for Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatically native president who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe it is incredible that the Court of Justice is in favour of Bolivia, and that it would not change much even if it does.
The United Nations Court of Justice, based in the Netherlands, has no right to assign Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision is announced only six months after the final arguments indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years may have hurt rather than promoted Bolivia's chances.
"The question of access to the sea has been captured by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
She claims that Morale's aggressive rhetoric has tarnished Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Prior to this, President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, did not consider that the court’s decision had been taken very quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia "an outstanding opportunity to start a new era for the relationship with Chile" and a chance to "stop for 139 years of differences of opinion with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the issue of the sea as a political cricket.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he said.
"The decision is a chance to realize that we must move on from the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament requires trust in the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says the nation will not break its nuclear weapons unless they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to meet the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the two rival leaders.
His comments came when US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo appears to be on the border to resolve the death situation for nuclear weapons plomatine more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "wanted dream" to continue sanctions and US protests against a statement to end the Korean War will ever be covering North Korea.
Washington hesitates to take part in the statement without Pyongyang starting significant nuclear destruction first.
Both Kim and U.S. president Donald Trump want a summit.
But there is widespread skepticism against the fact that Pyongyang is really going to get rid of a weapon scene that the country probably sees as its only chance of guaranteeing its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line huge main bases on the way to shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
The designs Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a range of fragile, oversized main foundations for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which blended the styles on Paris fashion week.
Incrediblely practical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designs have sent away their eye-catching creatures on the catwalk.
Valentino's main creation was an overcrowded beige with a bird-like board of hats that completely took over the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included juicy watermelons, a trolley hat and even a pineapple – but they are not meant to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, in good time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had mixed lips and looked rather Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature resembled a wet cloth with snorkel and thick mask, and another looked like a narrow glass layer.
And if you continue to be so brave, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hats can be on the way to shops near you.
The oversized hats come immediately after La Bomba – the helmet with a width of 60 cm that has been seen on all from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the incredibly practical hat that has taken over social media sent out another great creation on the catwalk – a half beach bag that was almost as big as the model in the bath suit that held it.
The raffia bag in the terracotta, with raffia francs and a white leather handle, was excellent in Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris fashion week.
The famousist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the shops next summer – the designer has had such an impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain outstanding academic results, and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, only strengthened by individual and collective progress in sport, art, music and other social engagements.
With up to 30 000 students in Scotland, the schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As a education sector that can design and implement adapted curriculums, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and requested subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it will reach his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot trust only in English when we create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's test results show that the language is the highest in the list, with the highest number of approved results in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received A in the final sample Higher Grade.
Data collected from SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 per cent of students studying mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as key skills such as children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as a matter of course is now considered as important as natural knowledge, technology, engineering and mathematics in schools and beyond.
A survey carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that employers for various reasons had difficulty filling their vacancies, with 17 per cent attributed to a lack of language skills.
In this way, language skills become increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more future jobs requiring language skills, these skills become necessary in a globalised world.
Regardless of their career choices, they will have a real benefit in the future if they have learned a different language.
To communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adult Brits published by YouGov 2013, 75 per cent replied that they could not speak a foreign language well enough to keep a conversation in it, and where French was the only language that came up in total in a two-digit percentage (15 per cent).
Therefore, it is so important to invest in language instruction for our children.
To speak several languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance of finding meaningful employment in the future.
In Scotland each school will learn different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach in languages that are considered to be most important for the United Kingdom by 2020, for example Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your children, there will always be a number of languages to choose from among school graduates, with teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In a global economic environment, there is no doubt that languages continue to be crucial for the future of the country, so it needs to be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication capacity".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for Scotland's youth.
It needs to be done well.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James do the debut for Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker's coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday's first season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he plays has not yet been determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Laker's official website.
Laker's reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' pre-season scheme.
"I don't need puzzle games at this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia campaign, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is making his first campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled performances next week, including events in places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Pending a confirmatory vote by its candidate to the Supreme Court's vacant post, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming mid-year elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the congress before the current elections in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trumps Wheeling, West Virginia campaign events are scheduled until 19:00, tonight Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trumps West Virginia-rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably deal with this week's interview of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who was charged with his sexual assault, with an expected delay in the Senate's vote of up to one week while the FBI's investigation of the case is ongoing.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help the Republicans get some meat on their legs before the November elections.
President Trump thus said that these five meetings next week aim to "engage volunteers and supporters when Republicans try to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the hectic campaign period," said one speaker for the Trump campaign that did not want to be named Reuters.
The night event, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can draw fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw attention from Pittsburgh's media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday the second time during the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican latent candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has been looking for the opinion polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come there to try to give him an increase in opinion polls," says Simon Haeder, a statesman at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA fights to keep the hopes of life ahead of Sunday's singles
After three unilateral sessions, the participants could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup on Saturday afternoon.
The torque pendulum is a fully invented sport concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever before in the face of competitions like these.
So what time is this about now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we carry it as a little moment I guess," said Jordan Spieth when he finished for the day.
Europe has, of course, four points ahead with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have some wind in the sail, but they have much to encourage, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and drove home three points of four each.
Speeth has been washed from tea to green and preceded by good examples.
The Winstrupen Scaled higher when his round continued and he lowered a decisive well to take the game four all-square when he and Thomas had played after two after two games.
His put that won them the game of 15 met with a similar wrangle, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your own match," Spieth said.
It's all that all these players have left now.
18 holes to victory.
The only players with more points than Speeth and Thomas during the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cups' unmistakable story.
Europe's exodus but mating couples are four from four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
These performances and public reactions confirm that they are the players to strike on Sunday and there are no more popular players who could come home a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Foremostly both, at the same time at different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victories.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process short with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero, along with Alex Noren.
A bowey and two doubles on the front nine dropped the Spaniards and the Swedish in a hole they never even came close to bending out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you out of the hole.
Fireball and foursome are so fascinating to look at closely because of the interaction between the couple, the advice they give, the advice they do not give and how a strategy can be changed at a moment.
Europe has played better as a law so far and has taken a significant lead over the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA had a fight which some, especially on the US side, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage on Ryder Cups the last day after coming out of Saturday's football and foursomes match a 10-6-lead over the USA.
The inspired duon Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led two victories over a famous Tiger Woods and drove home all four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European law, which fought to preserve the pocal that they lost at Hazeltine two years ago dominated an American law that never really started during the morning's football with 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursome and won two matches, but it was not enough for victory.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 single match to keep the pocal.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, baptized to "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, is only the second pair to win four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup's history.
After crossing Woods and Patrick Reed in a ball, they beat an exhausted Woods and American smoke Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5 & 4.
Woods, who went through two matches on Saturday, showed a sample of unique moments of brilliants, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in four balls and foursomes, and seven of them in row.
Justin Rose, calmed down in the morning and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 & 1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe did not go all the way, but it was a nice, breathable day in the south-west of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Speeth and Justin Thomas set the target for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They came home victorious with 2 & 1 over the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the football and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in the forum after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history has a team come back from a base on four points in single matches, however, Fury's side only needs an unpredicted result to keep the pocal.
After having been for the next two days, it looks like a counterattack on Sunday might be hard to get through.
North Korea says that the "never" will disarm unilaterally without confidence
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations in Saturday that continued sanctions deepened their mistrust towards the United States and it was not possible for the country to surrender its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation's annual General Assembly that in recent years North Korea had taken "significant steps to show its goodwill", for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, disassembling nuclear testing facilities and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we do not see any corresponding response from the USA," he said.
"Without any confidence for the United States, there will be no confidence for our national security, and under such circumstances there is no chance that we alone will disarm ourselves first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a approach divided into stages of nuclear power that would lead to North Korea being rewarded by gradual steps, his statement seemed significant, as it did not reject a unilateral nuclear solution entirely as Pyongyang had previously done.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work towards "the development of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first untie its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also given no thanks to negotiations to facilitate severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on "decoupling first" and increases the pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose by force and even to "declaration to end the war", says Ri.
"The notion that sanctions can get us on our knees is a wish dream for people who lack knowledge of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans at a second summit between Kim and Trump, which US leaders pointed out earlier in the United Nations during the week.
Instead, the minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and admitted: "If the party on this issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea and not the United States, the Korean semi-military violence would not have come to such a state of death."
Still, the tone in Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's future ability to reach the US's fixed state of rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "racetman" on a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take action for disarmament, but said that much work remains and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is dismantled.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months", it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The maintenance of the Security Council's sanctions must continue with force and without fail until we realize a complete, final, verified decommissioning."
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to revitalize the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri in conjunction with the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made. North Korea, however, accused him a few hours later to put "gang-like demands".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile plant and also a nuclear complex if the United States adopted "consistent measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "consistent measures" he was seeking were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and was moving towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Hard students take a course to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has been given to all doctoral students to improve their sleep habits in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture to study through caffeine-filled "digestions".
An academic study found that students at the world’s leading university are often unconscious with regard to the very foundations of how to deal with themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first in his class in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep loss on learning.
At the end of that, a girl came up to me and said, "Why don't I know this until now, in my last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleeping - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, organized for the first time this year, explains to students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and improve their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered severe sleep loss during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive data.
In part of the course there is a picture of a student room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another part, participants may know how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students directly.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in that there is still "dignity", he says and allows modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
To ensure that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - also to avoid weight gain because insomnia puts the brain in a state of hunger and makes them hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiar studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course and has read one of his courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course was an eye-opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus-wide course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study programme before they begin their studies at the institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider putting an alarm for when to lie down and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can cause you to turn on the day, leading to insomnia problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Men's goals are lowering Gerard's men
Rangers led another loss today when Dolly Menga's strike sent Steven Gerrard's uneven side to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox side was out after taking home its first victory on the road since February 4-1th at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's law delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches as manager to leave his team eight points after Ladbroke's Premiership leader Harts.
Many beat to seven minutes before half-time and Rangers never evened out the result.
While Rangers now falls to the sixth place, Livingston climbs to the third and is just behind the Hibernian on the target.
And there may be more problems on the edge of Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a major year after an object was thrown from the far end.
Gerard made eight changes in the semifinal of Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Livi 11 went with the same one who took a point of Hearts last week and he would have been happy about the way in which his bloody games dominated the opponents every time.
Rangers must have dominated, but Livingstone did more with the ball control they had.
It should have been a goal already two minutes in the game when Menga's first pass passed through Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle field missed its great chance and shot outside.
A frispark at the depth of Keaghan Jacobs then reached Lieutenant Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the back seat.
Rangers took control of the game, but it seemed to be more hopeful than faith in their games during the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelo certainly felt that he should have had a punishment when he and Steven Lawless were in a collapsing position, but Judge Steven Thomson fancied the call of the Colombian.
Rangers were only able to do two goals in the first half, but the former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly took easily against Lassana Coulibaly's nick and a tom kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Livis' opening shot in the 34th minute must go against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their skill earned it.
Again, Rangers failed to handle Jacob's situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher went to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the change gave almost immediate effect when the outside hit the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly jumped from his line to block the experiment.
But Livingstone continued to get the opponents to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett who swung up a long fit after a long fit.
Holt's side could have strengthened its lead in the last stage, but McGregor managed to prevent Jacob's before Lithgow ran out of the corner.
Rangers' successor Glenn Middleton had another late penalty claim when he got stuck with Jacobs, but he looked back at Thomson.
Almanac: The inventor of Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday's Almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the manicure called Geiger Meters.
Geigermeters have become a foundation for science since then and is also large in pop culture, as in the 1950s film "Bells of Coronado", with the main role of the uncanny cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
MAN, "What in the whole world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these hearings, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals. "Evans:
Evans: "Yes, it's popping now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63-year-old day.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune defense to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune defense to "see" cancer cells and kill them
The immune system will recognise cancer cells as part of treatment
The method means to extract and modify the immune cells from a patient in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many forms of cancer and then re-injected
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancer forms.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who learns to recognise cancer again, saw her ovarian cancer cells disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting the immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is common to many forms of cancer called HER2 and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promots the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovaries, lung and colon cancer," explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immunoses from patients and "learning" them how to address cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by wearing a MAGA keps, after his SNL performance.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was released from the studio during Saturday Night Live after a stunning performance where he praised the US President Donald Trump and said he himself would run for the post 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he was wearing a Make America Great Keps, he turned against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to a white person, they say, "How do you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's legal committee about the allegations of sexual abuses committed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not sent, the play of the West exhibition was uploaded on social media by comicist Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to drive with West with the post.
West had also complained to the public that he had been harassed for his master’s estate.
"They mobbed me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They raped me!
And then they say I fell low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to go down too?" and said he would "put my supermancape on, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Test with love."
His comments attracted more Bureau at least twice from the audience and employees from SNL seemed to be generated, reported Variety. One person said: "It became the death stimulant in the studio."
West had come in as a late replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose previous boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West broke many with its appearance of the song I Love it, dressed in a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: TACK FOR YOU TO BE AT YOUR MOBBEN."
But the host of the chat show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that the West simply "was himself and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I believe embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We're with her, allow her.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the former being known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's footsteps, even known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper colleague, Snoop Dogg, has named Himself Snoop Lion and, of course, the late Prince musician, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Dom for attempted murder after cutting at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been accused of attempted murder after a man was cut off at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The answer is expected to be found at Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The prosecutions will be examined by the Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington beats toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for its sword-fighting role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has spoken negatively about the stereotype of the macho helmet and says that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to respect.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her partner in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, even she 31, admitted that he felt "very strong" to deal with the problem.
"I personally feel pretty strong, right now--where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we raised men with regard to the problems we see now?"
Kit thinks that TV may partly be responsible for the increase of toxic masculinity due to its very masculinity characteristics.
He continued, "What is intruded and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, which makes young boys feel they have to be in a certain way to be a man?
I think it's really one of the big issues in our time - how do we change it?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview, he also acknowledged that he would not make any Game of Thrones followers when the series comes to an end next summer and says that he is "clear with battlefields and horses".
From November Kit will play in a new recording of Sam Shepards True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thought the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife thanks for the series, so she gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as Kit's character Jon Snow in love, in Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple married Leslie's family owners in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14 % of the population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been killed in the country, says the health authorities.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were transferred through sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spread through certain parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected by HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, the Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 from year to year.
HIV infection is an acute issue in the Chinese HBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination by HBT persons is said to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will marry women sooner or later.
Many of the infections are due to insufficient protection in combination with these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to have staff leaked the tasks of the GOP Senator, signs of "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
The US Congressman Maxine Waters condemned on Saturday the claim that one of her employees had posted personal data to three republican American senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles-Democrat claimed that these claims were disseminated by right-wing extremistic websites.
"Slanders, liars and more repugnant lies," said Waters in a Twitter statement.
The released information included addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information came online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a Senate panel on the charges of sexual assault against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Puntit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was associated with Water's office and released the information about a member of Water's staff, reported Hill.
"This unwarranted claim is completely false and an absolute lie," the Waters continued.
"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these misleading and false claims - were in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unwarranted claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Water's statement was quickly criticised online, including from the previous press secretary Ari Flescher.
"This disgusting one is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This indicates that she does not have the temper to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they can't be angry.
They can't be proud.
They shall not question the motives of the applicant.
They must be calm and sensitized."
Fleischer seemed to try to compare Water's reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who criticized critics for acting angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was running for Waters in the middle of the term of office, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Place of truth," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had warned "appropriate authorities and criminal beings of these fraudulent demands.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed," she continued "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their acts that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees."
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again - Powerless spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit meanings in every new British film, and the same seems to apply to this new recording of the latest Johnny English action comedin - a series of spy parodys launched in early 2003 with Johnny English and received a new life 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will we be aware of how clearly bad we are to become the nation's new export goods?
In any event, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has been given his license to pay for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comic creation intended for biopublic even in non-English countries
He is, of course, the clever secret agent, who in spite of his bizarre claims of smoothie glamorous has received a little bit of Clouseau, a chute Mr Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the OS in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man who Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There is one or two great moments in the latest JE film
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval suit and when the rotor blade struck his helmet for a short time.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is shown, but humor feels quite low and strangely superfluous, especially because the "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible itself now offer comedy as an ingredient.
Humorn feels as if it is adapted for children instead of adults and for me Johnny English is strange not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent filmbravader in the role as Bean.
The constant issue is now that Britain is in serious problems.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret network of spies, revealing the identities of all UK agents outside the field, to the agent of great dissatisfaction - an overwhelming role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last straw for a Prime Minister who is a Pompey and hard-working figure, who already suffers from a complete collapse of his political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing his best with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but the manuscript does not offer much to work with.
Her informant informs her that when each individual active spy is busy, she must use someone who has retired.
And that means the native Johnny English in his own high person, now employed as a teacher in a well-known institution, but offering informal lessons in art to work undercover next to it.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former long-lived sidekick Bow, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a subversive, a jolly-hockey-sticks-roll where Vicki Pepperdine is close to the town.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so terriblely wrong on Her Majesty's Secret Service and hitting Olga Kurylenko's beautiful woman fatal Ophelia Bulletin.
In time, the Prime Minister will fall hard for the charismatic tech-military, who claims that he can solve the UK's computer kit: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odyssé of pharassed subjects: dressed in serviers, they put fire on a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos when they slip on Volta's luxury boat; and English triggers clean anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to meet the inside of Volta's house.
There's probably a lot of work behind the last set, but despite the fact that the film is both charming and fast, it has an air of children's TV around it.
Pretty moderately everything like everything.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can't help thinking: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour refuses to prepare a plan for British to work a four-day week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Party Labour is considering a radical plan that assumes that the British work for a four-day week - but gets paid for five.
According to the Party, corporate leaders want to leave savings made through the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but keep the same pay.
According to sources, the idea would "pass" with the party's economic agenda for the benefit of the workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by trade union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A higher representative in Labor said to The Sunday Times: A review of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"It will not happen in one day, but a four-day work week is an effort that fits into the party's position to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, even the The Greens party that promised a four-day work week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this goal is not marked by Labour as a whole.
One spokesperson for Labour said: "A four-week working week is not the party's policy and that's not what the party agrees about."
The shadow cans John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to withdraw the power from "unrecognised leaders" and "sniffs" on state-owned businesses.
The plans of the shadow canals also mean that the current shareholders of water companies cannot get back their entire effort, as a Labour government can do "deduct" because of what they believe has been wrong.
He also confirmed plans to put employees in company boards and create the so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds, where 10% of the private company's own capital is transferred to its employees, which is then receiving annual allocations of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell the TV program "60 minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI's investigation of allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court with at least one week and raises the question of whether the Agency's investigations could allow some Republican senators to change their position.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal something that would lead them to change their views.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said when I went into the questioning, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, the claim came out, and he said, "Have you done it?"
He was determined, convinced, uncertain."
However, Graham's voice seems unstoppable.
"I've already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamism," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham admitted, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all her names couldn't verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an enormously impressive set-up of stars that appear and an equally impressive mission; to combat world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people going to Central Parks Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the real goal of the event: to combat extreme poverty before 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, according to a 2012 statement, is an extension of Global Poverty Project, an international pre-accession group that hopes to be able to combat poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you were not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteer work, email a world leader, call or otherwise meaningfully contribute to raising awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been for 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea to reward people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it just about so-called "clickivism" - people who feel they make a real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported that more than 19 million "documents" have been registered from its supporters who have fought for a variety of purposes.
These measures have helped to spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies corresponding to more than $37 billion, which will affect lives for more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid out or financed.
The group estimates that so far the accumulated assets have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the United Kingdom between investors and actors engaged in "helping children develop their full potential", promising to provide Rwanda $35 million to help combat malnutrition in the area after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make social injustices as nutrition is a footnote in history," the ambassador of the Tracey Ullman partnership told the crowd during a live-consistency in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, following more than 5000 measures, which require the United Kingdom to improve the cost of mothers and children, the government announced funding of the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes food programmes aimed at 5 million women and children.
As an answer to one of the common questions on his website, "What makes you think we can fight extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will become a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartement movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the artists who perform at the event of the year in New York, whose host is Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use its fleet in a "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports indicated by the Minister of the Interior
The government can "attend its fleet if necessary" to prevent Russian energy operators from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, has revealed by American Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria - particularly where it appears at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern parts of Europe," he said.
And according to him, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The US has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the waterways are kept open and, if necessary, to apply blocked, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to participants at the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group called the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to managing Russia and Iran, and noted that they really are the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is to exploit and exchange fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as a "day country" with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
Statements will be made after the Trump administration has aimed at increasing the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's officials, including President Donald Trump of the United States, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2-pipeline project, which according to Trump made Berlin a "captive".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline of $11 billion, which will double the existing power supply capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
They claim that Washington’s opposition to the project is driven only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was rejected by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I strongly hate that a third party disrupts our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will take a "ordinary thinker" if she sets up the 2020 presidential election," says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a "ordinary thinker" about her participation in the presidential election after the U.S. mid-year election.
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider putting up as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our dirty government and it includes a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take a real thinker to run for the President's post."
Warren turned to President Donald Trump during the council meeting and said that he "took this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply worried about what Donald Trump does for our democracy," she said.
Warren has been free in his criticism of Trump and his candidate to the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a vote on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own supporters did not believe that she would run 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "trustful" Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent for a potential candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other highly-profile democratic names discussed on a potential 2020 candidate include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after taking over in September.
He was arrested and accused of violence at home on Monday night.
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through now when he's back, I can relate to other families who have experience of PTSD and some of the trauma our soldiers are returning with," she told the audience at a gathering meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arresting "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they will return as other people, they will return, they will return and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and accused of domestic violence against a woman, attempting to prevent a report of domestic violence and possession of weapons, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, as well as the District of Columbia support the question of a new asylum policy
Arton states and District of Columbia support a legal trial aimed at a new American policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang-related violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted a friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the cores in the Grace v. Sessions case submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and his violent son-in-laws," abused her, but US officials refused her asylum application on 20 July.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
The state's advocates supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries producing a large number of asylum seekers, as nations facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy amended a 2014 decision by the immigration authorities which enabled illegal immigrants to seek asylum to flee violence at home.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a provision is contrary to that principle", according to the friend-of-the court report.
Advocates further argued in the report that the policies that deny immigrants' entry harm the US economy and argue that they are more inclined to become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary labour".
Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered in June that in the case of asylum judge no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asyl is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a certain social group or political opinion," the Sessions said when the policy was announced on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the number of deaths is doubled in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation looked increasingly disillusioned.
"It feels very exciting," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her feverish boy in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"The ambulatory collects dead bodies all the time.
Clean water is a waste."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their ruined homes, being rotted through water damaged properties and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospital, which was damaged in the earthquake of 7.5, was overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who were affected by a broken back and axel, died outside the hospital Palu's Army Hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors due to still severe post-mortem.
With tears in his eyes, he told us that the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We don't run him away.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press and allowed his family to be in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of "mobbing" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American newspaper on the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador charged China that Beijing used the US press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the fact that China Daily paid a supplement in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's best selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to participate in the U.S. 6th Congress elections, something that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in American elections marked what US officials told Reuters where a new phase in a escalating campaign from Washington was to press China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war with high tariffs on each other's imports.
China's compensation rates were designed early in the trade war to kill exporters in countries such as Iowa, which support Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a debate article in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "now doubles the mob by posting propaganda ads in our own free press."
"The Chinese government uses America's loving tradition of freedom of opinion and a free press to spread the propaganda by publishing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the newspaper sketch on the street here in Beijing you will find a limited number of divergent votes and will not see any true reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have about China's worrying economy, because the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party's iron hand," he wrote.
He allowed “one of China’s most prominent newspapers to deny the offer to publish” his article, even though he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans are scaring female voters from the mid-year election through Kavanaugh fiascot, warning analysts
Since many top republics defend the Supreme Court’s nominated Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that a setback will occur, especially from women, during the upcoming election.
The feelings about this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the elections.
It is impossible to turn back the clock, says Grant Reeher, professor of State Science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona) the last attempt on an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national speaker for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to Washington, DC.
On Friday morning, the protesting "November come!" when they demonstrated in the hall to the late building when the Republicans controlling the court committee chose to proceed with the Kavanaugh nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go to the top," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, for the news story.
"People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among still unspecified female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Before Ford’s public record of allegations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts proposed that a return be followed if the Republicans pressed through the confirmation.
"This has become a confusing pipe for GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the Committee's vote or the final vote or about Kavanaugh coming through, it is also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it," said Guy Cecil, Head of Priorities USA, a group helping democratic election campaigns, for the news channel.
But the Americans in general seem to be divided by who they should believe in in the cold water of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimony, and the latter seems to be the one they most believe in.
A new opinion poll by YouGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents definitely or probably believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35 per cent said that they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh was probably or was definitely lying under his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford, as well as by at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Court Committee last week that Kavanaugh violently attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez argues that the candidate to the Supreme Court exposed his sex organs to her while attending a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology facility project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons accessing what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solids technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data size" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, make-lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser simultaneously.
What is unique with the personal online data storage is that it is up to the user who can get access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorisation through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is to include resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some programme developers to work with the project and a group of volunteers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about how to introduce a complete change where all business models are placed on the top of a night.
"We don't ask for permission."
In a post on the Media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994 Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality in recent months.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this new era on the web," Berners-Lee allowed.
Bernard Water: Priestly rewarded with Victorian Cross during World War I
The only priest in the English Church who was rewarded with a Victorian crusade during the first world war is now celebrated in his home town 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for his action during the attack on Bellengise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a shot four days later and never learned that he had been awarded the most prestigious prize of the British military.
A memorial stone was discovered by his two children during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his childhood children, Michael Vann, said it was "bright symbolic", that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded with the price.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt Col Vann led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and masking guns."
He later moved up to the shooting line and led the "great bravery" line forward before he decided on his own.
Lt Col Water was killed by a German gunman on October 4, 1918 - a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I am very humble in front of."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also put down a crown after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "was very honored to play a role in the parade" and allowed "a real hero to be demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and instead got to see Greta Gris
Imagine this, you've stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 just to be refused to look at the main event.
The show from San Jose included 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown live at night in the UK on channel 5.
At 06:00, just as Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the British viewers were surprised when the program suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were deeply impressed by their keeping awake to the early hours of the morning to watch the game.
A Twitter fan described the change of program to a child program as "a sick joke".
"It was the Government's decision that the content was not appropriate so early in the morning, so they had to switch to a child program," said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of Bellator for marketing and communication when he was asked about the transmission.
"Sweet Grey, yes"
Bellator's CEO Scott Coker said they will work with their schedule to better include British viewers in the future.
"I think we'll be able to find a solution to the review," said Coker.
"But there's sex in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the program changed a lot.
We tried to do it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it was actually a state issue.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We will show five matches instead of six - as we normally do. We took water over our head in our effort to satisfy the fan.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "understanding" because of sexuality
The Olympic divers Tom Daley says that he felt the support of his friends during his growing up because of his sexuality - but it also led him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize he wasn't like everyone else until he went to high school."
When he spoke in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about homosexual rights to give other "hope".
He also said that he cared less about winning OS after becoming a parent.
The popular show's regular program leader, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
During his one-time performance at Laverne's first program, Daley tells how he felt "less worth" than others during his upbringing, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said, "This feeling of being less worth and feeling different has been a real source of strength and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so he didn't let everyone down when they found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic Bronze Medal has become a highly-profile advocate for HBT rights and has used its appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to convince more countries to criminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt he had the trip to live openly without restrictions and wanted to give others "hop".
The three-fold world champion said his love in a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "come as a surprise".
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscars winner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he participated in his first OS as a 14-year-old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was just about winning gold," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that Dad did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about whether they had received their tickets to the London Olympics in 2012 - where he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him: you won't be able to sit on the front row of Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally recognized that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The year after, Daley competed at OS 2012 and won bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to appear in front of a home audience on an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song - Proud of Heather Small - a song that had followed him up to OS and which still gave him cracks.

Mickelson in the shape of the bench under Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will beat record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but then he has to fix the form to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was hanged by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the centre of events, which he has often been for the United States, the five-fold winner spent his day between acting hejaclock and practicing his game in hopes of getting a chance to show off his ability.
He has never been the busiest of drivers, not even at the top of his career, and the 48-year-old is not in the shape of the tough track on Le Golf National, where the long call often misses the penalty.
It's not just the track that scares, in the ninth match on Sunday, Mickelson meets Master Francesco Molinari, who won all four games this week together with novice Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who are 4 points below the 12 single matches, have won at the beginning, Mickelson's match can be absolutely decisive.
Fury expressed confidence in his player, not because he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a kick on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"His self-confidence is not a mistake.
He is a knownist and has added so much to these teams during previous seasons and the past week.
I probably didn't think he'd be able to play two games.
I thought he'd do more, but now it's what it is and we'll be happy with it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson Nick Faldo's record passes for most Ryder Cup matches played.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never fully lived up to the heights of its individual results.
Mickelson has 18 winners, 20 losses and seven half, but Fury said his presence led to other qualities of the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he likes to joke with people and he's a good guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I also think that the younger players felt it was fun to play against him this week, which was fun to see.
He adds so much more than just games."
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership can soon be a memory just
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in the last day's singles in Ryder Cup can quickly be transformed into an unpleasant experience.
Dane did his debut in 1997 game at Valderrama, where a team under Seven Ballester's leadership had a five-point advantage over the Americans but as a final water with the lowest possible margin with score 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You remember that we led a lot on Valderrama, we led a lot on Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won an emergency and nest," said Bjorn (on the photo) after seeing the 2018 class win 5-3 both in Friday and yesterday and leads with 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone in the team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow we'll do everything.
Go out and do everything right.
This is not over until we see the point on the table.
Our goal is to try to win this pod and that is where our focus is.
I have said it all the time, I focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but we are well aware of what is waiting on the other side - the best players in the world."
Björn was satisfied with the performances of his players on a tough golf course and allowed: "I would never be able to do this myself.
Tomorrow's a new challenge.
Tomorrow, it's the individual performances that apply and it's a completely different thing.
It's fun to be out with a partner when it's good, but when you're out there on your own, your capacity as a golfer is fully tested.
It is the message you need to convey to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he must also go and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Björn, opponent Jim Furyk will want players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who drove home three points of four.
Fury himself has been on both sides of major turns during the last days of a competition, both in the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended as a loser when Europe drove "Miracle at Medina".
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in response when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, had gathered his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to go out as quickly as on Brookline, as on Medina.
When the pace starts at one point, there will be a lot of pressure on these mid-games.
We made our setup and placed the guys we wanted to, you know, create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight and meet Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the upper half of the scheme.
"I went with this group of guys in this arrangement because I think it's going all the way," said Bjorn about his single choice.
Germany's new warships are being recommitted
The German fleet's latest ferry would have been set up in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War, but it will not be set up until at least next year due to incorrect systems and high costs, reported local media.
The launch of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the joint ship for the entirely new Baden-Wuerttemberg Frogs, has now been launched until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which cites a military speaker.
The ship should have joined the fleet already in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery were destroyed for the ambitious project.
The four vessels in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the fleet ordered in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen fleets.
They will contain a powerful cannon, a series of air protection and marine measurement missiles, as well as some jewellery techniques, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the latest freightes for up to two years without contact with home ports.
But continuous delays mean that the road-breaking warships - which allow Germany to design power abroad - are already obsolete when they are in operation, Die Zeit writes.
The former F125 Fregate created headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to Blohm & Voss ship in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the causes of the return, but German media indicated a number of important "software and hardware goods" that made the warship valueless if it was used on a war mission.
Lacks in the software were particularly important as vessels in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be driven by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older freighters in the Bremen class.
It was also found that the ship has a significant overweight, which leads to impaired performance and limits the marine's ability to carry out future upgrades.
The 7 000 tonnes of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is assumed to be twice as heavy as similar vessels used by the Germans during World War II.
Except for wrong hardware, the entire project's price gap - including crew training - will also become a problem.
It is said to have increased to EUR 3.1 billion (US$ 3.6 billion) - compared to EUR 2.2 billion in the start-up phase.
The problems affecting the latest freight will become particularly important in the light of the latest warnings of a reduction in German maritime power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the fleet "starts to lack fully equipped vessels".
The servant said it was a growing problem, since old ships were being dismantled but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of the Flemish Müssen
New research carried out on a property in the Scottish High Countries is aimed at revealing how flatdermöss uses the landscape in its quest for food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and contribute to managing future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the South and Dwarf Pistrel as well as the brown long-haired and Daubenton flat möss at Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special players will be placed in important places around the property to track field musculoskeletal activities throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of flatdermus sounds and what species does what.
A life map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Care Advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of life are most important to the flats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of life-based management work such as the creation of pastures and how forest fields can best be maintained for flat moustaches and other related species.
Flemish mus population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased considerably in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the wells and losses of living environments.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as aeroplanes and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as home tax attacks.
Fledermöss is actually not blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching the change.
They use sophisticated eco-location technology to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes flat möss seriously.
The organisation has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out investigations, examine the vouchers and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has also established the first and only dedicated flatdermus reserve of Scotland at the Triple Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten flatdermus species of Scotland.
Owner David Thompson says ownership is the ideal area for them.
"Here at Thrave we have a good area for flat moustache," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of Veterans entrances and a variety of beneficial living environments.
But there is much about flat moustache that is still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to understand more about what they need to thrive.
He stresses the importance of searching for flat moustache before performing maintenance in properties, as it is possible that accidental destruction of a single dwelling could kill up to 400 honors and young people, and possibly rob an entire population.
Fleddermöss is peaceful and it is illegal to kill, trouble or disturb them or destroy their bonds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish Officer for Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and too many of our species we don't know how their populations are."
Ronaldo rejects violence while his lawyers threaten to agree with the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the charges of violence against him for "false news" and says that people "want to market" by using his name.
His lawyers will vote in favour of the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus forward have been accused of rapeing an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He claims to have paid her $375.000 to keep quiet about the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live video on Instagram, Ronaldo (33) struck the reports as "false news" when he spoke to his 142 million followers, only hours after the requirements were reported.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
What they said today was false news," said the five-fold Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's good," said the player and log.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to vote for Der Spiegel's claim, which they have called "an unauthorised reporting of suspicions of integrity", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage to an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged event was said to have taken place in June 2009 in a sweat at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he was supposed to have raped her anal, according to documents submitted by Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged event and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" the failure of the "last percentage".
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was in agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photos of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed on a reconciliation because she felt "fear for revenge" and was concerned about "being humiliated publicly".
The 34th year says she is now trying to cancel the settlement because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and in summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: Britain "comes for ever regret" to lose car manufacturers
Britain "should regret it forever" if you lost your status as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He allowed it to be 'disgusting' that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, they would temporarily cease production at the factory in Burnston near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer announced that the effects of delays at the border in the event of a contract being terminated could result in lost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March we will see production stop in our factory," says Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO at Burnston.
Other British car manufacturers have communicated their concern about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its mini-installation in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems concern what car manufacturers say are the risks of the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without settlement.
Toyota's production line is based on "just-in-time", with parts coming within 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it may lead to disturbances at the frontiers that the industry says may lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's consumption in storage at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and therefore production would be forced to stop.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequer's plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid border controls".
"We need a settlement. We want the best agreement that allows, as I say, not only success at the moment to be appreciated, but for us to take this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4: Today's program.
"The statements from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supplier chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term it warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and thus slow down the cost of work.
Peter Tsouvallais, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the leader of the United Trade Union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "My experience is that these jobs will never come back.
One government official said: "We have put forward an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "cut off for another week" while the fight against the Supreme Court appointed Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian involvement in the election, the relationship between Trump and Russia and the President's potential obstacle to justice.
Whether Trump will kick the assistant Justice Minister, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington's squalls for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying hearing equipment to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the president through the 25th addition of the American Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, reporting that he was going to leave.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then in the United Nations headquarters in New York, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate's legal committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual immorality, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date for that has not been established, it can happen this week, or a one-week delay, in view of all the other matters that occur at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would argue: Sanders has not had a press conference from the White House since 10 September.
The value of Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to anything unpleasant to TV reporters who "play for the gallery", even though she said, "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President holds several questioning sessions than any president before him," she admitted without quoting the evidence: "We have looked at these figures."
Conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this often and you have seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and it will replace press conferences, and then you can ask questions directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre performance before the assembled reporters.
Minister of Health writes to EU employees at NHS Scotland with regard to concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish to remain behind Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the cost of settled status applications for EU citizens working in the country's decentralised public sector.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU continue to take place, in the face of decisions expected to come in the autumn.
However, the British government has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know that this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I value the efforts of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Members of the EU as a whole, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves the work of health care and benefits the patients and society we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after he has suffered from headache
Tennessee State Tiger's lineback Christian Abercrombie underwent an acute operation after having suffered a major injury in Saturday's loss of 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State chief coach Rod Reed told the reporters that the damage occurred immediately before half a time.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie acid on the sideline before placing it on a bar was carried out for further evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was operating at the Vanderbilt Medical Center Hospital.
Harris admitted that "there is no information on the type/range of the damage yet" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year high school student, is in her first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five pickles on Saturday before leaving the game, which gave him a seasonal total of 18 pickles.
Foreign buyers will be debited higher stamp tax when they purchase a property in the UK
Foreign buyers may pay higher stamp tax when they purchase property in the United Kingdom, and the extra money is used to help the homeless, according to Tory's new plans
The action should neutralise Corby's success by attracting young voters
The increase in stamp tax will apply to those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The UK Department of Finance expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be paid a higher stamp tax when they buy property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help homeless people, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corby's success by attracting young voters with promises of more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in stamp tax will be taken out of individuals and companies who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom.
The additional fee is in addition to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago in holiday homes and homes purchased for rent. It may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will bring up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13% of the newly built properties in London are purchased by people living outside the UK. This drives prices and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to get a foot on the housing market.
Many well-known areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new game will only come a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the stamp tax to help younger people to buy their first apartment.
He accused large construction companies to keep prices up by buying land without using it, and urged Theresa May to refrain from quotas on housing with affordable prices to solve the "necessary housing situation" of the United Kingdom.
Jeremy Corbyn has launched an exciting range of proposals for housing reforms, including rental ceilings and an end to cleaning without the fault of the tenant.
He also wants to give the municipalities more opportunity to build new homes.
Theresa May says: "Last year I said that I would spend my time as Prime Minister to restore the British dream, that life will be better for every new generation.
This means solving the problems in the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be right when it is as easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, and for companies who are based abroad, to buy homes as hard workers in our country.
The dream of owning their home has become too many people just a distant dream, and homelessness is still an unworthy fact."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to train Scotland"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his "final goal" is to ever become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old shot looks forward to the challenge of blowing up life in the club from northeastern England, which is currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light in the summer after taking St. Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a game in the B-country team, and that's all," Ross tells the BBC Scotland Sports Sound.
"But when I grew up, I looked a lot at Scotland at the Hampden with my dad, and it has always drawn me back.
But that chance can only come if I manage to lead a club."
Among Ross's representatives are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he was not worried about inheriting such established names in such a large club. He has previously thanked no for offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Just now, I'm assessing success from the answer to the question, 'Can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
This club is absolutely home to Premier League, considering its structure and talent," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably just see myself as a success here if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a period as assistant coach in Dumbarton and a 15-month season as a member of Heart's training team.
Then he helped Alloa come back from moving back to the third division, and lifted St. Mirren from being close to moving to become the winner of the season's championship title.
Ross says he is more satisfied now than ever during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"That was probably a reason," he recalls, referring to when he took command of Alloa.
"I really thought leadership was absolutely right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
That sounds strange, because I had good results and could live on it, and I also had some great success.
But playing can be tough.
That's a lot you have to go through every week.
It's still stress and pressure on the job for me, but training feels absolutely right.
I've always wanted to practice and now I'm doing it. I feel better than I've ever done in my adult life."

A survey shows that the perfect time to take a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday
Summer's heat bubbles have led to increased income for the country's fighting pubs, but the restaurant chains have got more pressure on themselves.
Figures showed that pubs and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but the revenues of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, from the CGA corporate advisory company, who has compiled the figures, said: "Remaining beautiful weather and the fact that England remained in VM longer than expected meant that we had a similar pattern in July compared to June when the pubs went up by 2.8%.
The decrease in the turnover of restaurants by 1.8% in June was only worse in July.
Pubars and bars that mainly offer drinks showed the absolutely best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than the restaurants had gone down.
Pubars offering food were also difficult in the beautiful weather, even though it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
People seem to have just wanted to go out and have a drink.
The release of managed pubs and bars went up by 6,6 % that month, and the food sale went down by 3 %."
Paul Newman at the service and entertainment industry analyst RSM says: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and major sporting events are still the most important factors in the wholesale market.
It is no surprise that the restaurant groups still have difficulties, even though a decrease in sales of 4.8 % each year is particularly difficult to deal with in addition to current cost pressure.
The long warm summer could not have come more uncomfortable for companies driven by food sales. Time can show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August give any proper respect."
The total sales increase in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened facilities, was 2.7% in July. It reflects the fact that fewer new brands are now being launched.
Industry Sales Monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub bar and restaurant industry in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes information on how it is for 47 active groups with a total turnover of over 9 billion pounds, and is an established benchmark in the industry.
One of five children has secret accounts on social media they hide for their parents
A survey shows that one of five children, sometimes as young as 11 years of age, have secret accounts on social media that they hide for their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students shows an increase in the number of fake Instagram sites
The result has increased concern that there is sexual content being put up there
20% of students indicated that they had a "main account" they showed to their parents
One of five children, some as young as 11 years of age, creates accounts on social media that they keep secret for adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students and high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Instakontons", a reference to the Instagram Picture Sharing Service.
The result has slowed down because it is sexual content that is posted there.
20% of students said they have a clean "main account" that they can show to their parents, and they also have private accounts.
A mother who sneezed over the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to "violate me."
According to the study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistress Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of the children between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them acknowledged that they had private accounts.
The president of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are attracted to creating places on the Internet where parents and teachers do not find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the board of the Scottish Free Sport Association, Scottish Athletics
Elid Doyle has been elected to the Management Board of Scottish Athletics as an external board member at the annual meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most prized free queen, and President Ian Beattie describes the election as an outstanding opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her wide experience at international level in the last decade.
"Eilid has won great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly from becoming a member of the board," Beattie says.
Doyle says, "I want to be a voice for athletes and I hope that I can help and help lead sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres at OS in Atlanta 1996, has a total of four Olympic gold and is now an expert commentator on BBC.
He writes on Twitter: "Today a month ago, I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that it was time for me to recover, and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I've recovered completely, learned to go again and now I'm doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouragement!"
Advertising for breast pumps that compare mothers with what the Internet shares
A company that sells breast pumps has caused Internet differences of opinion with an ad comparing breast-feeding mothers with cows that are milked.
In order to highlight the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent portable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie has released a music-inspired commercial film with humorist estimates to show on which freedom the new pump gives mothers pumping breast milk.
Four real moms dance in a hilarious song with choirs to a song with lines like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I don't have any beans" and "If you didn't know, this isn't a juger, it's a joke."
The tail goes on, "Fump out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
But the commercial film, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused a conflict on the Internet.
The film has received 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, and has received mixed reactions from the viewers. Many say it sheds light on the "fasor" of the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision to use curves to market this product.
Just as we have to get pregnant and feed to be able to produce milk, their young people are only taken from them a few days after birth," writes one person.

Another commented: "You understand that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But of course, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their children?"
Someone else adds: "What reality-responsive advertising film."
Others defend the film, and a woman admits that she thinks the song is "historic fun."
"I think this is brilliant.
I'd have gotten one if I was still breast-feeding.
Pumping made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product," someone writes.
Another commented: "This is a fun commercial that turns to moms as pumps (usually at the workplace or at the toilet) and feels like 'cossor'."
This is not a film that celebrates or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump stopped in need.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely quiet, has no cables or pipes and can be worn discreetly in a nursing home, which gives women the freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while the pumps.
Ana Balarin is co-owner and ECD at Mother, and she says: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women pumping breast milk and milk, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and the challenges with it, while showing in a entertaining and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that gives the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump creates headlines.
During London’s fashion week, a two-child mom appeared on the catwalk with the clothes of designer Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a camp near the border in Texas
The number of children deprived of their liberty has dropped significantly even though the number of persons crossing the border each month is relatively unchanged, partly due to the ethnic rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump government has made it more difficult to place the children with reference persons.
In the past, most referees themselves have been paperless immigrants, and fear to put their own chances of staying in the country at risk by declaring themselves willing to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential referees and other adult members of the household would have to leave fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Authority, witnessed in front of the Congress that the Authority had arrested dozens of people who had applied to be referred to as single minors.
The Authority subsequently confirmed that 70 % of those arrested were not known by law enforcement authorities since then.
"Almost 80% of the persons who are either referees or family members of referees are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are criminal aliens.
So we continue to persecute these individuals," said Albence.
In order to deal with children's affairs more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to be in court within a month of being deprived of their liberty, rather than after 60 days, which previously was practice, according to staff at the offices.
Many of them are present on video link rather than personally to bring their statement of legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not judged to have the right to protection shall be deported quickly.
The longer children are deprived of liberty the more likely it is that they are suffering from anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or refugee attempts, according to staff at the settlements and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Speakers say that noise rises at larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is more likely to be ignored, due to the size of the facility.
They add that if children are moved to the tents without having enough time to prepare emotionally and take good care of friends, they can worsen the traumas many are already being broken with.
Syria requires US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegal in Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem stressed that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that the government in Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have freed all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has approximately 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war - hardened country.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances are good for them to come home, and accused "some Western countries" of "dispersing irrational fear" that enable refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They're policing something that should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The US and the EU have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a fresh agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel Idlib has created an opportunity to proceed with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement was a major attack by Russian-supported Syrian troops against the province, which has three million inhabitants.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines", and expressed hope that a military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Al Qaida-connected Nusra front, who "will be defeated".
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, is soon hoping to be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government members and members of the opposition, in order to make a draft post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem set up conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee and said that the Group's work would be limited to "the review of the articles of the current Constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a re-election
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the re-election of 2020 unless his presidency was completed in advance by the rule of law and scandal, which many liberal spectators are likely to hope for.
In what, without a doubt, would be "the most dramatic final of a presidency ever!"
At present, there is no sign that the viewers are tired.
Since 2014, viewers have been more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN, and are almost three times as high, 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best transmission time, which is an increase of 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has toped the lists for cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers during major news evenings.
"This is like a fire that people are drawn to, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC's "Designed Survivor" drama, which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed Capitolium.
Nell Scovell is a versatile comedy author and has written "Just the Funny Parts: And a Five Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club". She has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he was going to vote on Donald Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Cause he makes me laugh," says Nell Scovell to me.
The chaos has an entertainment value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, Washington's report can determine the future of the abortion case, Roe vs Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the prosperity of the global economy.
Shutting down is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one has suddenly sat and watched for six hours on an expert panel discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" to his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's bomber jacket for $15,000 (a plague filled with hybrids", as Washington Post said) and the meaning of the stormy Daniel's macabre descriptions of Donald Trump, hm, anatomy.
I'll never see Super Mario myself the same way again.
"Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality series is that he comes with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's rotating roll crew and day-to-day intrigues (very grilled with NFL, praised Kim Jong-un).

When I spoke to the TV producer Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sun and 27 degrees outside his house on northern Kaui in Hawaii, but he sat and looked indoors and watched MSNBC at the same time as he recorded a broadcast from CNN.
He could not get tired, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be brought before the Senate's judicial committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in the wake of the wave.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from currents into the smoothest race ever before the mid-year election
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania 17th Congressional District receives a lot of money, thanks to the restructuring of a Congressional District that has made two members now competing for the same place.
This newly bordered district of Pittsburgh is represented by the Democratic Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb campaign against another member, Republican Keith Rothfus. He is currently representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were drawn after Pennsylvania's Supreme Court in January decided that the old districts were constitutionally changed to the benefit of the Republicans.
The merger in the new 17th district has led to a campaign financing dispute between the major parties' economic sections, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee, (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a short win in a wide-guarded special election in March to Pennsylvania 18th Congress District.
That place had been held by a republic for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts had given the Democrats a certain advance.
USA considered punishing El Salvador for China's support but then backed up
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama until the shareholders hired the team of the Trump organization.
Officials of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs decided to call home the heads of the US missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the newly decided not to recognise Taiwan", said the department's spokesman Heather Nauert in a statement earlier this month.
However, only sanctions were planned against El Salvador, which was estimated to have received $140 million in US aid in 2017. The money would, among other things, go to drug control and development and constitute financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American country hard with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
At the same time as the internal meetings continued, US and Central American officials launched a high-level conference focusing on security and economic well-being to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
However, in mid-September, high officials within the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, which in practice stopped the discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which will take place in mid-October.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
One spokesperson for John Bolton from the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by the three American officials, two of whom were diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal negotiations against the promise of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also expressed himself anonymously.
Study history
The next inevitable step may be the special investigator Robert Mueller's report on Donald Trump's alleged wrongdoing in the case, as there is now tangible evidence in public registers.
Mueller is also reported to control his investigation as to whether Donald Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in its attack on the US elections.
If the convention were to change the majority, Trump would be held responsible for that congregation just as he was preparing to stand up for the election once again, and perhaps finally before a civil jury.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to claim that Trump will inevitably fall, nor his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to face different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how the extracts can be.
In 1938, German officials were ready to launch a coup against Hitler, if only the Western countries had stood against him and stood behind the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath that followed.
History revolves around such decisive events, and the unnecessary progress of democracy is accelerated either on or off.
Americans are now facing several of these decisive events.
What should we do if Donald Trump gives Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what's going to happen to Mueller's investigation, the shot?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that he has proposed to record the president in secret last year and speculated that he would not be fit for the office.
Rosenstein says The Times reporting is wrong.
"How should we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he is given access to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, in the middle of the year, are we going to vote for a congress holding Donald Trump in charge?
If we fail in these tests, democracy is facing a dark period.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of that reading I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy residence.
She survived, migrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me on the way to light the Sabbath light on the table decorated with the hacker.
With what is inherited, how could I be anything but optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is optimistic about the meeting with Rapid Wien
Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday. They know that winning the Austrians after the impressive Spanish match against Villareal that ended unexpectedly earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A cracker prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first performance for the season, until the 2-2-game match against Villareal. But he thinks Rangers can use the result as a springboard against greater success.
"It was a good point for us, because Villareal is a good law," says the 31st.
"We went into the game in faith that we could get something, and went from there with a point.
Maybe we could have gotten it in the end, but in the vastst sense there was probably a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half, and we came back in the second half, and that was better.
Now on Thursday, it will be an important evening in Europe again.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it becomes a tough match. They got a good result at their last match, but if we have the audience with us, we can certainly get up and get a good result.
Last year was very tough, with everything that happened to my injuries and changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The body is good and the guys are fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put the last season behind us and succeed."
Women sleep poorly because of fear of pension savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear picture of how they wanted to be treated, few spoke to their family members about it.
Some half of the people who participated in the countrywide study said that they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't step up and talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
This is how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to care if you don't talk about how you want it in good time.
Work with your advisor and your family and discuss where and how you want to care. Your choices may be of great importance to the costs.
Get help from your economic advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance solution, a hybrid life insurance solution with cash value to cover the costs, or a self-insurance with your own resources, if you have advice.
Establish legal acts: Avoid legal disputes from the beginning.
Create a care authority so that you can appoint a trusted person who looks over your medical care and ensure that your healthcare staff follow your wishes, if you become unable to communicate.
Consider, too, a mandate for your economy.
Then you choose a trusted person who can make economic decisions instead and make sure your bills are paid if you are unable.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who is in an emergency medical condition and is on her way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down such details so you're ready.
"It's not just the economy that's at stake, but who are the doctors?" said Martin.
"What kind of medicine is that?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure the plan is ready."
Firefighted several times in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a gun when he walked home from a night out.
The sacrifice, which is at the age of 40, was located in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon when he was shot in the chest, neck and hand.
The police describe the shooting, which took place around 02:30, as a single event.
The victim didn't see his attacker.
The damage is not life-threatening, and the police call the witnesses to hear from themselves.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday.
The communications are off, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to obtain any information from the management area of Dongala, a region north of Palu which is located near the epicenter of the earthquake. The earthquake measured 7.5 on the Richterskalan.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Dongala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city's population was estimated to be 379 800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Dongåla is a management area extending over 300 km from the north-west coast of Sulawesi.
The administrative area, which is an administrative region in a province, in 2017 had a population estimated to be 299 200 people.
The pillars of the Central Sulawesi economy are fisheries and agriculture.
Nickel mining is also significant in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past hundred years, according to Indonesia’s disaster management authority.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Also in 1996 the West Dongala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the circulatory seismic furnace, which is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake at the west coast of the Indonesian Aceh province of North Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries. 226,000 people died along the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with magnitude 6,8 on the Richterskalan hit south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: A earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with magnitude 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai islands outside Sumatra. A tsunami of up to 10 meters was triggered. dozens of villages were destroyed and about 300 people were killed.
2016: A basic earthquake hit the Pidi Jaya administrative area in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that collapsed together.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok. More than 500 people died, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily beached.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaska Governor and vice president Sarah Palin, has been arrested for abuse.
Palin, who is 29 years old and from Wasilla in Alaska, is arrested suspected of domestic violence, for having filed a report on domestic violence and for having opposed the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday of Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he should have taken the phone from a female acquaintance who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin sits in the Mat-Su harbor and is held against the debt of $500 to be paid if the suspect breaks the terms of the debt, according to the TV channel KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "guaranteeed not guilty" when he was asked to give up his position, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected of three cases of minor crimes under Class A, which means that he can be imprisoned for up to a year and $250,000 in fines.
He has also been accused of a case of minor B crime, which is punished with one day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
It's not the first time Palin's been charged with crime.
In December 2017 he was charged with violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now handled by Alaska's veterinary school.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, for having reported domestic violence and for holding arms under the influence of that incident.
His girlfriend accuses him of hitting her face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 after she had linked her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome, which stems from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake, measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity and communications are down, and death figures are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck immediately outside the central Sulawesi, northeastern Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
Films that show when it hit it are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had been gathered to a beach festival in the city of Palu when Tsunamin crossed the coast.
Federal prosecutors work on rare death penalty for a suspect of terrorist rape in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are in charge of the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. It is a rare punishment that has not been committed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is supposed to have used a rental car from the building and interior chain Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway on lower Manhattan.
In order to justify a death sentence, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "willly" killed the eight victims and "willfully" caused serious bodily injury, according to the death penalty declaration filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges may result in a death sentence, according to the case-law.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was charged by a federal jury of 22 points, including eight cases of murder to support protection activities, often used by federal prosecutors in the purpose of organised crime, as well as trafficking and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "extensive planning and intention," the prosecutors said, while describing the way Saipov carried it out as "disgusting, cruel and inhuman".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage and loss", says the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
New York's southern district has not been charged with a death penalty for a decade.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was killed by two drug addicts, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty was executed in a federal goal in New York in 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced to espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were both executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed a lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to the court document.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was pleased with what he had done.
According to the contract, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack after watching IS films on his phone.
He also asked to have the IS flag set up in his hospital room, the police reported.
He has not declared himself guilty of the 22 charges in the court.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov. He admitted that they are "probably disappointed" in the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to pursue death penalty rather than to join life imprisonment without the possibility of conditional release if the accused confesses to himself only prolongs the trauma which these events have caused for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's team of defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to pursue a death penalty.
Mr Tories said that NIGEL FARAGE should be held responsible for the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest at the Turies conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must "know the heat" of the EU skeptics when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians proposed that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative member Peter Bone said at the March in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "should have gone out of the way" if Nigel Farage had been the minister of Brexit.
However, the challenge faced by Theresa May in getting the deeply divided supporters to be reconciled has been exacerbated by positive tory members of the EU, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister fights to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers Agreement, in the course of the attacks by Brexitans, people who want to stay in the Union and the European Union themselves.
Her allies have insisted that she should press and try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the backdrop, and force EU skeptics and Labour Party to choose between her package solution and "chaos".
Bone said at a mass meeting organized by the Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "sola Chequers Agreement".
He indicated that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had stood at the edge, we would have been out at this level," he said.
Peter Bone, who represents the district of Wellingborough in Parliament, admitted: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to sell the Chequers Agreement."
He clarified his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought world wars to be examined.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the allegations that the public opinion would have changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British would have changed and now want to remain is completely inconvenient."
The Brexitan prisoner Andrea Jenkyns of the Tory Party was also on the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say, 'Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers agreement is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in the party and in our electors who are outside the streets and ensure that we are elected.
Leave the Chequers deal and start listening."
And she allowed a sharp message addressed to Theresa May: "Ministers can keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that politicians must be "conscious of the heat" if they would fail the decision taken in the referendum in 2016.
"Now it's about trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to cheat Brexit, and we're here today to say to them, 'We're not going to let you get away with it.'"
In front of the enthusiastic crowd, he said, "I want you to get our political class, which is close to betraying Brexit, to feel the heat.
We mobilize the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we won't rest until we have become an independent, self-government and proud Great Britain."
At the same time, EU supporters marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in the central city.
A group of activists fanned with tracks with the text "Tory members against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
The Labour Parliamentarian Lord Adonis of the Overhouse threatened the conservatives for the security problems they supported with a party app when the conference opened.
"It is these people who say that they can have IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus plus the agreement, for free-of-charge frontiers and free-trade without frontiers in Ireland," he admitted.
"It's a pure father.
There's no good Brexit," he said.
Warren is planning a "ordinary thinker" to run for the President's post
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to take a "ordinary thinker to run for the President's post" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke of his future during a cityhouse meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticised President Donald Trump, and is now re-electioning the Republican State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was the deputy president of the Donald Trump campaign in Massachusetts 2016.
She has been the subject of speculations that she may be taking over Donald Trump 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th city house meeting with the electors since Donald Trump came in.
A person asked her if she was planning to run for the president's office.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our dirty government, which means a woman at the top."
A person arrested for shooting the basketball player Sims from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge in Louisiana announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for shooting the LSU bass player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11 a.m. for ET.
They had released a film of the shooting on Friday to help identify a man who sees the images.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot to death near Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually died of it," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via the news page 247 sports.
Wayde went between to defend his friend and got shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he had been on the scene and had a gun, and he admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any incidents and led to arrest at the East Baton Rouge police station.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm long and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, and scored 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world champion's title after the theatre killer gave him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes' teams would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and almost hung Hamilton on the dryer when he defended his position under the first two arms, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into them first and let Hamilton drive back into the cave, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went in there a row later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after a little wheel-to-wheel action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free with risk to offer in place after a double pull to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started in the back row and lay seven at the end of the first row on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race and held in the deck to reach a quick target and drive about Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
Finally, he arrived at the end of the 44th Wing, but failed to raise the pace during the remaining eight Wings when the Raikkonen went up in fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team has done an exceptional job and got one and two," said Hamilton.
Pretty bad body language
President Donald Trump accused Senator Diane Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday, because she maintains that she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated judge of the Supreme Court, is accused of sexual abuse.
The President, who spoke at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly raise the testimony from Ford before the Senate's Justice Committee. Instead, he commented that what was said in the Senate showed that people were "illegal, undiscovered and false."
"The only thing that could happen and the nice thing that has happened in the last days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry, ugly, undiscovered, and lying," he said.
"You see the press releases and leaks and they say, 'No, I haven't done it.
I haven't done it.'
Do you remember?
Have you gone to bed, Diane Feinstein?
Do you remember her answer? 'Have you leaked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I didn't miss it.'
Wait a minute.
'Have we leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything',' he admitted, and he imitated the senator.
The letter with details of Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have come from her office.
"I have not obscured Ford's accusations, I have not leaked her story," Feinstein told the committee according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she wished."
But her dementia does not seem to have passed the president, who, during the Saturday evening's meeting, commented: "I will say one thing to you. That was really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but that was the worst language I've ever seen."
The President continues to support the candidate to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, and he indicated that the Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to withdraw the power with all necessary means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," said the president, according to the Digital Newspaper Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two targets for Belfast Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars saw the loss of Friday in Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Belfast Giants received an early two-way tour through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tweeted for the home team before Dwyer restored Belfast Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard tweeted for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen assured victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the Adam Keefs season, which came from behind and beat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth season meeting for the two laws, and Belfast Giants had won the three previous matches.
Dwyer's opening target came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on Assistant from Kendall McFaul, and David Rutherford gave Assistant when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
During the intensive first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the match at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie who tweeted at 15:16.
Dwyer saw that Belfast Giants was in the lead at the first break when he made his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard even again with a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, and he secured the win with his team's fifth half through the final period.
Belfast Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, will play home against Milton Keynes at his next match on Friday.
Airplanes died so that hundreds of people on a plane could flee from the earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia is now honored as a hero after he was born when he made sure that a plan with hundreds of people on board could be safely lifted.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a large earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are stuck in the bustle of the city of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild swinging control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could safely lift.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was going to crack.
He was born later in a hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of people's lives, according to the Australian TV channel ABC News.
"We arranged with a helicopter from Balikpapan on Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
We're shocked to hear this," he admitted.
At the same time, the authorities are in danger that the death rate may rise to over a thousand people. The disaster relief authority of the country says that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death rate is likely to continue to increase as there are still many bodies in the ruins, and many have not been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the Authority.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mom Risa Kusuma said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with dead bodies.
It's bad about clean water.
The retail markets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will face from there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can be much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" according to CNN.
Indonesia was previously hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a man is missing after an aircraft crashed in a lagoon
The airline responsible for the plan that was disrupted in Micronesia in the Pacific now reports that a man is missing. Previously it was said that all 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated from the sinking plane and were safe.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer the questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed in the water when it tried to land at the airport at Chukören.
Officials indicated on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and how the incident occurred.
The airline and the American fleet both indicated that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane was passing the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very low.
"It's extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others managed to swim through deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking planet.
He said that the cabin staff were panicked and screaming, and that he had a smaller headache.
The U.S. Navy said that seamen working nearby to develop a shipyard also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to drive people in the country before the planet fell in the deep water in the 30 meters.
Aviation Safety Network data shows that 111 people have been in accidents with airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analysts draw up a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
The Åklaggarside concluded its complaint on Saturday in the second trial against a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi living 2014.
The analyst Paul Rowlett of the U.S. Department of Justice spoke for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used mobile phone lists to puzzle together the 29-year-old attributed Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber's movements that night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location information from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers that night she died, which contradicts his previous claim, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber's cell phone during the time he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "laughing, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another objection was that Tellis indicated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone lists showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis once after Chamber's death deleted Chamber's text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He sucked her out of his life," said Hale.
The defence is scheduled to begin its final submission on Sunday.
The judge said he was expecting the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is the hippop?
A hippop-trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol thinks that the hippope has come far from its origin in political messages and to address social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make the hippop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons have recently received a reinvigoration in the United Kingdom by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
A black one again?!
A child girl in New York agrees with a couple due to cancellation after a "racist" text message
A child girl in New York agrees with a couple of discriminatory terminations after receiving a wrong text message from modern, who complained that she was "a black again".
The couple denies that they would be racist and compare the mood with "expression".
The twin mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her fears when she realized that the new girl Giselle Maurice was black when she came to her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEIJ NOT A SVART IGEN," Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text to his husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice twice.
After she realized her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "slow to courage", and gave Maurice the shot, claiming that their former African-American child girl had done a bad job and that she was expecting a Filipino woman, according to New York Post.
Maurice got paid for one day's work and was sent home by taxi.
Now she's getting the couple's compensation for the dismissal. She's asking for compensation in the size scheme $350 per day for the job she was originally hired to do, which would be six months and where she would live with the couple.
"I want to show them you don't do that," she said to New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple's accusing of being racist and saying that the only reason was to end Giselle Maurice's employment, and they were worried that they would not be able to trust her when they had abused her.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said fellow Joel Plasco to New York Post.
"But would you trust your children to someone you've been rude to, even if it was wrong?
Your newborn baby?
I'm serious."
Plasco compared the mood with "expression" and said that his wife would give birth to children two months later and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Would you like to take care of such a person?
It is not particularly pleasant," the investment banker Plasco admitted.
The legal process is still ongoing, but the public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticises them for their behaviour and reasoning.
The Paddington publishers did not think that the readers could relate to a speaking bear, revealing a new letter
The writer of Paddington, Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, commented: "It's hard to think about how it was for a person who read it for the first time before it was issued.
It is very fun, given what we now know about the great success of Paddington."
She told her father, who had worked as a cameraman on BBC before he was inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She allowed the 60-year-old jewel of the first edition to be "bitterly-loving" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family", and allowed her father to be proud of the silence of his final success.
"He was quite quiet of himself, and not any shy person," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds in something. You get proud of the child even though it is not yourself who has achieved it.
I think he saw Paddington's successes a little bit like that.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always used to give Paddington his own honor."
My daughter was going to die, and I got to say good-bye to her phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nade called regularly to say that it was really bad, and that you didn't expect her to make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I got a call from Nad that said she would die in two minutes and that I had to say good-bye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my dear.
I'll be right back to you.
I'm coming to you.
The doctors who had given her to keep her heart alive slowly broke out and left her body.
She had died just before and now everything went down.
I just got to sit there and wait and know that all this happened.
I couldn't veer or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who now suffered the loss of her daughter, went on board with the other passengers, who were completely unaware of the difficult test she went through.
"No one knew about it," she said.
"I bowed my head, and the tears broke all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt an overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women set up visas to prevent suicide in bridges
Two women who have lost their loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up a card on a brother in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that you can call to get support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and he took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to need as bad as I do every day," she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, and she tells us that her son was a promising cook who had a contagious smile.
"All knew who he was because of his smile.
They said his smile lit up the room."
But he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his cousin when he took his life from 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I worry all the time for consequences."
Sharon Davis created the card "for people to know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be quiet, talk about it."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost his partner for 15 years, Mark, a time after his mother's death.
"He had not said that he felt depressed or depressed or anything," she says.
"Some days before Christmas, we noticed that he prayed differently.
On Christmas day he was on the bottom, and when the children opened their Christmas posters, he had no eye contact with them or anything."
She says his death was a very severe blow to them, but they have to get through it. "It breaks up a wound in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to fight all over."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI launches an investigation
"I thought that if we could achieve something similar to what he asked for - a study that is limited in time and scope - we might have a little agreement," Jeff Flake said on Saturday, and he allowed him to fear that the committee would be split because of deep-rooted party differences.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their resistance depends entirely on the time.
The mid-year elections will take place in just five weeks, on 6 November. If the Republicans make a bad choice, which is expected, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the one they want to choose to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was personally secretary to George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to break the state of death and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean lander "sunker" in Kim
The number of North Koreans jumping to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, which cites data from the Ministry of Association of South Korea, says that 1,127 people missed last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park says that stronger border controls between North Korea and China and higher charges to human smugglers are important causes.
Pyongyang has not come with any public comments.
Finally, most of North Korea's fans are offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fly through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the hard-guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China sees the dropouts as illegal migrants rather than as refugees and often sends them back with violence.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is technically still at war with each other, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two Pyongyang countries met for talks focusing on the ongoing negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work so that the Korean peninsula would be free of nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US of the failure to succeed since then.
"Without confidence for the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we cannot absolutely disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Ri at a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", and says he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
The Minority Leader in the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosis comments came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had done so, she would be called 'hysterical'," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate's justice committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the charges of having sacrificed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening presentation, Kavanaugh was deeply touched, and then he nearly shouted, and the voice stopped talking about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee, and said that the charges against him were a "grostic and coordinated murder" organised by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she felt that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was partial to the detriment of the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi doubted when she was asked if she would try to put Kavanaugh before the court if he was elected and if the Democrats get a majority in the House.
"I can say this - if he does not tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not only inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court that he is on now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeal in Washington D.C.
Pelosi allowed her as a democrat to be concerned about what decisions Kavanaugh might have to take against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion of Roe vs. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation questions, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not a situation for a hysterical and partyy person to sit in the courtroom and expect us all to applaud," said Pelosi.
Women have to stand out.
It is a just criticism, months and years of anger that boils over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual.
And she continued, "I got good help from a woman who was a CEO somewhere. She said she also cried when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started to cry, she said to the person she spoke to: 'You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
I thought it was bright."
Tears are allowed to lead to anger in part because they are often misunderstood in the basics.
One of my most clear memories from one of my first jobs in a man-dominated office, where I once wept of indescribable anger, was that I was taken into the arms of an older woman. It was a cool boss I had always been a little scared of, and she dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sorry and they're happy to press you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught up with an out-of-court business on a boat called Monkey Business and moved out of the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason not to investigate the idea of putting himself up in the presidential election.
"It wasn't a well-thought decision," she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, the last one they needed was another.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Because she was late out, she lay behind with the money collection, and promised not to enter as a candidate if she didn't get $2 million.
It was a project condemned to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men just gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in a speech that she would not start a formal presidential campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings, gratitude for those who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to collect money and address the voters rather than delegates, and anger against sexism, that the voice stopped.
"You could have thought I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Schröder about the press's reactions.
"You could have believed that Kleinex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, "What are they gonna write on my grave?"
'She's crying?'
Why the US-China trade war can be good for Beijing
The opening of the trade war between the United States and China was an atrocious one. The war is far from over, but the gap between the countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning squad earlier this year by covering important Chinese export goods such as solar panels, steel and aluminium with customs.
The most important event came this week, with new customs duties on goods for $200 billion, which in practice means that half of all goods coming into the USA from China are customs-covered.
Peking has answered with the same coin every time, and recently it was charged between five and ten percent of US goods for $60 billion.
China has promised to match the USA's action. The world's next largest economy will probably not step down in a short time.
To get Washington back means to bend to the demands, but to publicly cry for the United States would be quite generous to China's President Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its short right, the US trade war press can provide a positive support to China in the long term, by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
"A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions for economic panic in the country, and it is actually much more dangerous than the viewers previously wanted to acknowledge," says Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security thinking.
Syria 'redo' for return refugees, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says the country is ready to accept voluntary return refugees and cries for help to build the country, which lies in ruins after the more than seven years of war.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are now improving.
"Today's situation is more stable and secure, thanks to our success in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
There are now all conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihood.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have moved the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian support.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he stressed that it does not receive conditional support or assistance from countries that have supported the rebellion.
Europe won the victory in Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won 2018's Ryder Cup by winning Team USA with the end of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was able to fight hard during most of the tournament, was trapped in the water at the launch of the 16th of the 3rd hole, and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever made 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth released 5 & 4 of the European team's lowest ranking players, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest ranking player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who could have made his last Ryder Cup.
Spanishman Sergio Garcia, who is a veteran with eight Ryder Cup behind him, became the most successful European ever with 25.5 career points.
"I don't use crying, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win back victory.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be of help," said a touching Garcia after the victory of the European team.
He left the sticker to his countryman John Ram who defeated the American golfing Tiger Woods 2+1 in a single Sunday.
"What incredible pride to have Tiger Woods hit. I'm raised to look at him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France, and now has the result 13-21-3 for his career in Ryder Cup.
A remarkable statistics for one of the world's best players ever, who have won 14 major titles, which has only been exceeded by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA fought all weekend to find fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the team's downgrading performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
That was the day this morning when we were rising the temperature in Europe.
We took the shot.
Hated by Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the U.S. PGA tour and our Ryder Cup committee and then we're going on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
You get a bow and a bow.
They played better than we did."
Algae flowering: Stops decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Forestry Commission shows a general decrease in algal flowering concentrations for parts of the area around Tampa Bay.
According to the Commission, more uneven flowers are reported in the areas around the major municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier.
The algal flower extends for about 20 miles from the coast, from the north of Pinellas to the south of Lee.
Flocks can be seen about a half mile out of the sea outside the great municipality of Hillsborough, but in less places than last week.
Algaflowering has also been observed in the great municipality of Pasco.
Average concentrations in or outside the coast of Pinellas have been reported over the past week. Outside the coast of Hillsboroughs are low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations in or outside the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations to medium high concentrations in or outside the coast of Lee, and low concentrations in Collier.
Reports of respiratory irritation continue to come from the great municipalities Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in northwestern Florida last week.
