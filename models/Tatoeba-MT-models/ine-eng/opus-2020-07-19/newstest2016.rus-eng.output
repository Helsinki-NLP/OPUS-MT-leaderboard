The social map of the Ivanov Region is recognized by electronic means of payment.
The amendments provide for the maintenance of a public passenger transport allowance.
With effect from 24 September, the arrangements for the voluntary travel of citizens with the social map of the Ivanov region have changed.
As reported by the Russian Government in the Ivanov area, the changes provide for the maintenance of public passenger transport opportunities and provide a social map calculation scheme in accordance with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 of the National Payment System.
However, the social map of Ivanov area is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its application are changed.
Thus, the filling limit is now not established on trips as before, but in cash, with winter and summer periods not more than 400 rubles, not more than 800 rubles per month in the summer.
The social card holders will now need to track not the number of travel left, but the balance of money.
The cost of a convenient trip for citizens will be 1/2 of the fare of the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of the trip is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The timetable for filling the social card with money remains the same - from 24 numbers in the previous month to 23 numbers in the current month.
A new social map would have a number of advantages.
Thus, there is the possibility of a detailed account of the spending of money on a social card, with a copy of it.
In addition, there is the possibility of returning the assessed but unencumbered money.
Let us also add that the calculation scheme with carriers becomes transparent, as now half the cost of travel is paid by citizens, and exactly the same amount is reimbursed by the carrier.
There will be no commission when money is placed on the map.
In turn, Vasili Silkin, Deputy Chief of the Department of Road and Transport of the Ivanov Region, reported that in 2014 more than 33 million social trips were made in the region, and nearly 25 million in 2015.
In the area budget, more than 470 million rubles are provided for the benefit of citizens using a social card.
As of 1 September, more than 312 million rubles were reimbursed for these purposes.
At the time of the 911 call, the teacher is recognized in the murder of a friend
At the time of the 911 call, almost without a uniform, the coach Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his friend and that he needed staff to come home.
Lamb stressed that there is a "pesik" in the house, which is alive, but probably upset, and said that contact with family members could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prettiss' body and a note handwriting on the white sheet of the taped paper: "I'm very sorry, I wish I'd all come back, I loved Amy, and she was the only woman who ever loved me," says the note, according to the representatives of the body signed by Lamb.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who took two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, was able to travel 300 miles to a university campus where, according to the police, he shot all the respected history teacher of Ethan Schmidt at the threshold of his office.
The Chief of Police at Delta Linn Baford State University reported that the university staff were informed of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that real call in 911 shortly after that.
By the end of the day, the victims will have one more: Lamb has killed himself as soon as the police have surrounded him.
The next day, after the shooting at the educational institution had forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, organ staff were still trying to put in one picture the motive behind Lamba.
Information shared by investigators on both sides of the state, as well as by students and staff who knew him, helped to produce a talented but perhaps concerned teacher.
The students told me that they were looking forward to his work.
The police in Gotya, where Prentiss died, reported that they were not charged with violence or criminal offences.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in his written book, in which he expressed appreciation for the “beautiful people, ” with whom he had spent his teaching life.
They both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 teachers, and many students attended the lessons of that and others.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
One student who had a good report about Lambe, Brandon Bevers, said that he seemed nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him.
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that at the end of the 2014-15 school year, Lamb told him how he struggled with stress.
Earlier Lamb asked Delta State University to grant him sick leave, said he had some health problems.
He taught only two online courses this year.
Recent changes in university rules of admission meant that a doctor's degree, over which Lamb had worked so hard, would not guarantee him that he would automatically receive a teacher's position.
The president of William Laford University reported that he knew nothing about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "evidently Mr. Lamb had something on his mind."
These are the questions Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
The police attacked after Lamb's escape from the camp when he was sent back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot 38 caliber in the backyard of his home, one mile south of his parents ’ home in the Greenville suburb of Mississippi, reported the coroner of Washington Metel Johnson.
His car with a working engine was still on the road.
Immediately it was unclear why Lamb had come to this house, although, according to Johnson, she believed that he knew the people who lived in it.
Lamb grew up in those lands.
Lamb began to work at a university of 3,500 students in the city with a population of about 12,000 in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He was given the degree of doctor of pedagogical science in the spring of the same year.
One of the ancient friends of Lamb described him as a wise, charismatic, and cheerful person.
Carla Hayston told me that she was 15, and Lambo was 20 when they met through common friends.
She and her friends studied in the senior class, and he was a classmate older, who for several years tried to teach her to play guitar.
He enjoyed the success of women in those years.
All the girls hid when he was near," says Harrison, who now lives in Jackson, Brandon's capital.
Lamb and Prentiss have been dating for a while.
At 911 Lamb's call, he said, "I killed my wife," but there's no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Litning, who lived with them in Gote, in a Kyrpic house, whose back is on the channel.
According to the police, the dog's fine.
The ex-husband Prentiss, Sean O'Stin, reported that they were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and that they have a daughter who is 19 years old now.
"She's quite exhausted," O'Stin said about the daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he didn't meet Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and was playing blues.
Lamb met with Prentiss when he and Abigail both attended a summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at the concerts.
O'Spin told me his daughter wrote music and poems.
Prentis was a nurse and worked online for different companies.
Mike Schaffer, a bartender and co-ordinator of entertainment programs at The Julep Room, in Gottie, said that he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the evening of September 5th when Lamb finished playing guitar and lost charm for a few visitors.
There was nothing suspicious.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We had fun and we had fun over each other.
In the sense that they were both very sharp.
Schmidt, the deceased teacher, held seminars for the first class and specialized in the history of indigenous Americans and colonial America, said Don Alan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same educational institution.
He was married and he had three little children.
He studied at the University of Kansas in Emporia and was president of the Student Brotherhood and Student Self-Government.
At Delta State University in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and members of the community, participated in a memorial ceremony for the burning of candles.
Ms. Schmidt Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Business will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," said Laford.
Crisis's over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rohelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped to prepare authors of Associated Press Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with a statement by the police that the Lamb had received 911 after the murder of Schmidt, and that although Lamb and spoke about Prentiss as his wife, when he called 911, there was no confirmation of what they had been married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us announced that he would not hire as many staff for the holiday season as he did last year, while the children's toy and goods rider assured them that he would allow staff and temporary staff to work more hours.
The company reported that it plans to employ 40,000 people to work in shops and on optimists throughout the country, less than 45,000 who were hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company reported that it would begin interviews with the applicants this month and would increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although a few more months before the holidays, the purchase season is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary staff to have enough state in stores and to sell, download and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox is kidding about the "welding" with Princess Diana.
The film premiere "Back to the Future" was a great event for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the arrival of the royal family, and I noticed that a place next to me was free, and here I was taken - next to me is Princess Diana," he told the trailer on the screen of the documentary "Back in Time".
The movie starts, and here I come to my head, that I'm literally out of hand and in a fake zeubek since I met Princess Welski.
"Back in Time" is a documentary on "Back in the Future" film, which includes an interview with Fox, Lee Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spillberg.
The movie "Back to the Future" premiere was held 30 years ago.
"For me," says Spielberg, "this is undoubtedly the biggest movie of travel in the time that has ever been taken."
"Back in time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in some theaters in October.
UN chapter states that there is no military solution in Syria
In response to the Russian military support of Syria, the Secretary-General, Mr. Pan Ki-moon, stated that there was no “military solution” for the nearly five-year conflict, and that the increase in arms would only increase violence and suffering for millions.
The UN chapter again called upon all participants, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Mr. Gi Moon said at the press conference on Wednesday that he planned a meeting with the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent members of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that differences in the Council, as well as among the Syrian and local authorities, had “made the situation unsolved”.
Mr. Gui Moon called on five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they had demonstrated in addressing the issue of Iran ' s nuclear programme and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 survey results that show Donald Trump is not kidding.
Some have tried to put a provocator's label on it.
Others turned away from him, perceived him as a joke.
And some need scandals.
But no matter how some Republicans try to break Donald Trump's high position in the polls, they have failed.
Ten of the last 11 national surveys have demonstrated the advantage of Donald Trump in two digits, and some are starting to seriously wonder what this means for a magnet of real estate from the point of view of getting a nomination.
Of course, it's just the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to name the Republican Party.
The experts point out that in 2011, Rick Perry gave up his winning popularity to German Cain, none of which won one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in the general election.
But external groups, such as the Jeba Bush Super Committee of Political Activity, and the economic conservative group, the Growth Club, recognize the unsatisfying force of Trump and begin to deliver their dollars to challenge him.
Here are some of the survey figures that say that the real estate magnet is not just an intermediate phase:
Sympathy ratings for Trump were 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his application in mid-June, a survey at Monmouth University showed that only two of the 10 Republicans had a positive impact on this magnet in the area of real estate.
By mid-July, that was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 per cent.
Six of the 10 Republics now have a positive impact on Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all of these indicators are at the top in the early stages.
The Quinnipiac survey in Iowa last week found that 60 per cent of the Republics there had a positive impact on Trump.
Two thirds of those voting for the GOP would form a candidate for Trump.
In the CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 per cent of the Republicans said that they had either "belonged" or "suffered" if Trump had become a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "distorted" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 per cent say that they would "be sharp" against 40 per cent of those who say the same thing about Trump).
The next level of lightning?
Marco Rubio, only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republicans say that they will be "unsatisfied" or "disarmed" if the Jeb Bush festival is approved as a candidate.
Most Republicans do not consider the tempo of Trump to be a problem.
While the Trumpet is criticised for its praise and insults, 52 per cent of voters from all over the country think that the magnet has the right temperature to be the president, as shown by the ABC News/Washington post poll held on Monday.
The same figure is found in the first closed congregation in Iowa, where the same 52 per cent of the Republicans believe that he has the same person as the chief commander, Quinnipiac said last week.
However, 44 per cent believe that he is not the person who can be effective at the post, and nearly six out of 10 independent voters say that his temperature is not suitable for the White House, reports ABC/Post.
The Republican voters are accustomed to this idea.
When they put on their hats, the Republican voters think Trump is serious.
On the question of which was the most likely winner in the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said that Trump was a favorite, according to CNN/ORC survey last week.
It's not like four out of 10 were put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: The GOP voters had no right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the past cycle, four out of 10 Republicans elected Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent supported possible candidate Mitta Romney.
However, this shows that many GOP voters consider the Trump campaign to be convincing.
Even if the Republicans were to split around another candidate, Trump was still ahead of everyone else.
Some figures indicate that this distribution is likely to be of the advantage of the Trump, while the non-Tramp supporters are equally distributed among the more than ten other candidates.
But a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that in the hypothetical competition "one per one" between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump is almost always supported by the majority.
He runs Carli Fiorino at 13 points, Marko Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeba Bush at 19 points, and finally Randa Paul, John Cassic and Chris Christi at 33 points.
He has nothing to do with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who's around him?
Ben Carson beat the businessmen at 19 points in the hypothetical competition "one by one".
Half of Donald Trump's proponents say they've changed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT survey conducted on Tuesday showed that only half of the Tampa-supported voters said they were confident in their votes.
Clearly, there is much that can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he will never change his mind.
46 per cent say they leave the door open to other candidates.
However, the most intense competition in Trump for the moment is with a colleague-outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've changed their minds will probably choose Trump.
Six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called immigrants from Mexico "violents" in his speech opening the campaign, the topic of immigration became the most relevant topic in the 2016 talks.
Some are concerned that the Trump series will turn away key voters of Latin American origin from the Republican party and interfere with rebranding.
However, according to the ABC/Post survey held on Monday, six of the 10 Republicans said they agreed with Trump on immigration.
Therefore, until immigration attracts general attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Disappointment by the Government has taken on new developments.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now looking to support approximately half of the Republican voters, mainly because of their foreign status.
Six of the 10 Republicans said on Monday a new ABC/Post survey that they wanted a political outsider rather than a man with experience in the Government.
And they're also injured in Washington.
The survey of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three of the four Republicans in Iowa were disappointed by the activities of the Republicans in Congress, with 54 per cent being “unsatisfied”, and 21 per cent being “in anger”.
The Government will decide on the fate of the pension indexes in October.
Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodec stated that the Government is now looking for options to implement the pension indexing law in 2016 at a real level of inflation, the GG is transferring.
She noted that the decision should be found by 8 October at the time of the submission of the draft budget for the following year to the Government.
In addition, the cabmin discussed the option of extending the decision to freeze the Russian savings pension.
The hungry noted that the pension fund amounted to 350 billion rubles.
The total pension index for the following year is about as much.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there is not a final decision on the question of who should pay contributions for non-working citizens.
A hungry person believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not apply to socially unprotected categories of citizens, it is not entirely fair that he will be paid for by society.
The media had previously reported that the cab had two options for balancing the budget.
Why are they often angry and red for centuries?
Dr. Tatian Levashov answers:
Our lives are broad, protecting the eyelids from the many tiny particles that are sitting on them.
Forgetting the regular cleansing of the centuries, we often contribute to the development of bluff.
Simple output:
Not three eyes with dirty hands, wearing a special wet solstice for centuries;
At least 1-2 times a day cleans the ends of the centuries from those stored in them for the day of harmful substances.
The cleaning procedures are not sufficient to complement the warm compressions with the openings of the healing grass (halves, romachs) that exacerbate the dense secret of salty iron and then the mass of the ends of the ages to be carried out by circular movements of fingertips;
Don’t use alcohol while washing your makeup.
They dry and deplete the skin and further enhance the secret of salt iron.
Pyrenees claim that the Korean nuclearists have created an atomic warhead.
The North Korean authorities reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country, the nuclear complex in Yonbene, is “full-power”.
This was reported on the Central Telegraph Agency of the country.
It is noted that at any time, the DPRK is ready to respond to the “aggression and nuclear threat of the United States”, as well as that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “both by quantity and by quality”.
The latest test of nuclear weapons was carried out by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
However, plans to restore the reactor ' s full-time work have not been reported since.
Phenjan claims that he was able to create an atomic warhead.
Also, the CDR has repeatedly tested the mid- and short-range missile, writes polit.ru.
Girinovski needed to remove the mention of the brothers from the Russian gymnast.
Leader of LDPR Vladimir Girinovski believes that the reference to the unity of the brotherhood should be removed from the national gymnasium.
He said that during the Gosmuda meeting, the Russian News Service reported.
Who are these peoples now?
Fascists and murderers!
"A very long gymnast, the longest in the world, even sportsmen don't survive," said Girinovski.
The Member considers that all four items containing this line should be removed:
In the summer of 2014, Girinovski stated that the current gym needs to be changed to "God the King of Food", while the Russian tricolor replaces the imperial flag, writes polit.ru.
Assad urged all the forces to join in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar Assad urged all forces to join in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe wants to deal with the problem of refugees, they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not that Europe accepts or does not accept refugees, but that it is necessary to address the root causes of the problem.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
It's our opinion on this issue.
"In this matter of refugees," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in the name of consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are not possible until people die as long as the bloodshed continues and people do not feel fully secure.
"So we can reach consensus, but we can't do anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria," Assad stressed.
It is recalled that some 500 thousand migrants, including those from Syria, arrived in the countries of the European Union this year.
The European Commission has stated that the current migration crisis in the world is the largest since World War II.
It is not excluded that thousands of militants from the Islamic State might be among the arrivals of migrants in Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization prohibited in Russia may use the situation to create their own cells in the EU for the conduct of terrorist activities.
The people of the German city set up a holiday for refugees.
In the last month, Germany had become a leader in the reception of refugees, although it had recently strengthened border control in order to hold them back.
According to the authorities, some 800 thousand migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts call them very large numbers.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country.
The correspondent, Jenny Hill, was in Darmstadt City, whose residents provide migrants with a very warm reception.
Jeremy Corbin debuted at the session of the Prime Minister
Following the election of Mr. Corbin, his debut at the session of the Prime Minister's affairs was expected with great anticipation.
The new leader of the Leborist Party, Jeremy Corbin, will be the first to address the Prime Minister's questions for the first time, with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will address the first of the six issues raised in the afternoon; his statement will probably be closely monitored by the press and members of Parliament from the Labour Party.
He called for “less theatre and more facts” in a weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that he could miss some meetings by leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test by Mr. Corbin as the leader; it will take place after his appointment of a thin office and his words at the annual Congress of Trade Unions on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the leader of the lobbyist's decision to stand silent during the national gym on Tuesday, during the 75th anniversary of the British Battle, was criticised by a number of conservative members of Parliament and became the subject of several excellent articles in newspapers.
Mr. Corbin ' s decision not to sing a State gymnast drew attention
Mr. Corbin's Press Secretary stated that he was “standin’t right” and acknowledged “the heroism of the Royal VHS in Battle for Britain”.
However, a member of Mr. Corbin Owen Smith's office reported Newsnight to BBC 2 that he would advise the leader of the Laborists to sing the national “independent” gym in his belief that the monarchy was needed to be abolished.
Almost a dozen dark ministers refused to play in Mr. Corbin's team, sounding differences in economic, defence and international policy, while at least one sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
Political correspondent BBC Robin Brant said that political differences were also "copied by a stop" in the Laborist party after Mr. Corbin was appointed as a post in the European Union and the Government had limited compensation payments.
Mr. Corbin said at the Trade Union Conference that the Labour Party had introduced amendments aimed at eliminating the very idea of limitations in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the Minister of Labour and Pensions, said that there was "full clarity" in the party, because it was opposed only to Government plans to reduce the ceiling from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of the lobbyists David Cameron will meet in the "Course Box" for the past ten years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Laborists, who had promised a different approach to politics, stated that he had “drawed collective resources” to raise the ideas of Mr. Cameron and received over 30,000 proposals.
A member of Parliament from the Islandton North District said that the Prime Minister's issues were causing excessive confrontation, and that he would also refrain from disproportionate responses and the exchange of amounts, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and problems facing young people.
Mr. Corbin said that Angela Igle, the Minister of Economic Affairs in the TEN, would replace him with the Prime Minister when he was not present, for example when Mr. Cameron was on the border.
He also sounded the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor if possible, saying that he was addressing the Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercou to discuss the matter.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to leave the political style of the “armor pay”, often associated with the Prime Minister's procedure, but recognized that he had failed several years later.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister's questions have been a key indicator of the leadership's views, their ability to manage the House of Commons and their reputation with other members of Parliament, although critics claim that this has become a cartoon and requires major reforms.
"Snake in Yoburg" homeless young people who have been trained in photography

Pound sterlings grow as wages grow in Britain
The pound was raised in front of wage growth in Britain, and the FTSE 100 index was raised thanks to the proposal to buy SABMiller.
From May to June, UK earnings, excluding bonuses, increased by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate has been the highest since 2009, and has been seen as a shift to earlier forecasts for possible growth of quotations.
The pound of sterling increased by more than 1 per cent in relation to the dollar and amounted to $1,5505 and 0.84 per cent in relation to the euro by €1,3730.
FTSE 100 grew to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
In general, SABMiller's shares, which grew by 20 per cent, were allocated through the purchase proposal from the AB InBev competitor.
The deal would unite two world-renowned brewing companies with brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
The Burberry shares grew by 0.9% in the light of encouraging news from the competing Lux Richemont product group.
The latest data on Richemont sales exceeded all expectations and showed that sales in China - in the key market for Burberry - began to grow again.
Glencore shares grew by 5 per cent after the mining giant stated that it was able to receive $2.5 billion by placement of shares, which was done under the debt reduction strategy.
Mondi's paper production and packaging group shares were in the index of 4.3 per cent after Goldman Sachs reduced the group's ratings to "sale".
JD Sports shares grew after the sports clothing company reported an 83 per cent increase in tax for up to 46.6 million pounds.
Chief JD Sports says that higher wages can interfere with exposure
Executive Director JD Sports Peter Caugill says that the increase in the minimum wage for British workers means “more purchasing capacity in the pockets of potential consumers”.
But it is unlikely that such purchasing capacity will outweigh the increase in labour costs, he says.
The costs could affect JD Sports expansion plans, he added, which could mean a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash launches a downward campaign to combat Aldi's pressure
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the pressure of Aldi in South Australia and Western Australia.
The leading supplier of food on the initiative below launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA rolling stock in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the upcoming impact of Aldi $700 million.
While Aldi is preparing to open two optical stores and the first of 120 shops in South and West Australia in the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relations with local food suppliers and promote IGA brand through marketing in leading media and social networks and on Adelaide Show.
The campaign is accompanied by IGA riders and suppliers, such as the manufacturer of frozen Simmo's from Dansboro, who offers a tasting in IGA shops, and store owners selling discounted tickets to the South Australian Football League.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its strategy of protection on 29 September, the day that this supplyer of food, spirit drinks and agricultural products will carry out its annual investor strategy day.
There was little to be done because in South Australia and Western Australia, IGA stores account for almost 30 per cent of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and West Australia are known as regular routes, so the market is more favourable to IGA riders than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, more than 30 per cent in the U.S. and 24 per cent in WA than in some 14 per cent in the Eastern States.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will pay 5 per cent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of its first stores, taking the volume of sales to all the players present, but mainly to independent cyclists.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, analyst Morgan Stanley, believes that IGA Riddlers can lose $300 million a year in sales and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA, with sales of $500 million and 600 million in these markets respectively.
The loss of profits and sales of food at the high level of the constant cost of Metcash may cost companies approximately 13 million income before payment of interest and taxes, Mr. Kirat said.
At the same time, Metcash loses its share of the market in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and this is because the recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA had the most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing the company's market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the chief fund manager, Hamish Douglas, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, observed that the business lunch in Melbourne “metcash” could be very likely to disappear for decades.
Metcash refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas' comments.
But a member of the board of directors of Metcash was expected to contact Mr. Douglas last week.
The share of IGA on the market decreased from 18 to 14 per cent from 2010 and Metcash's income from the food business, which the company supplies to some 1200 IGA Riddlers, fell by 43 per cent compared to 2012 as a result of operational development and due to sales and profitability pressures.
However, the company does not give up spending more than $150 million a year to compare price differences with the prices of Coles and Woolworths in thousands of positions each week and to help IGA reintroducing its trading venues, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wider choice of food.
Director-General Metcash Ien Morris said that price alignment and refurbishment of trading venues were taking place and hoped that the company would increase net income in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakis supports President Tennis Australia Steve Hilly
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves starters, not criticisms of his behavior.
Tanasi Kokkinakis has suffered in a recent scandal with his friend Nick Kiryos and deserves more than criticism, says President Dennis Australia Steve Hilli.
Kokkinakis, a young man in a talented duet and often called Special Ks, was reluctantly focused because of Kyrós' postponing with Stan Wavrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Soon thereafter, during a hot qualification match in Cincinnati, the judge had to understand the Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, while Harrison said: "The warline had to be placed on Cyrus' shovels, and I had to be placed on this guy's shovels."
C while Kokkinakis last saw a cracking missile after the shipman in his leg rescued Rishar Gaske from possible defeat at the US Open, Hilly loyally protects Kokkinakis.
The youth is currently in Glasgow, fighting with Sam Grott for the right to be the second after Bernard Tomic alone in the Kubka Davis semifinal against Great Britain.
"I am deeply concerned about one thing, namely that Tanasi was involved in the conflict," said Hilly.
He really broke a rocket when he had his foot on the US Open, but he wasn't the first player to break the missile when the hopes were gone, and I know Tanasi pretty well enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he was very well in a rather provocative situation in the US, with Harrison, etc., and I'm sure he deserves confidence.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a beautiful family, and I just think he's been a little dishonest.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works a lot, he's very good at the team, he's never had any problems with other players, he's respected outside the court, he's intensively trained, he's excellent, he's a very focused and developed young man, and I think he should be valued in dignity.
Hillie also supported the decision to forgive Cyrus for an important match starting on Friday, assuming the "joint agreement" was the right outcome for all, but expecting that the guy from Canberra would return to the team as a long-term player.
"First of all, we want the team to focus fully on the match, not on the fights around [Cyrus]," Hilly said.
And I think Nick has gained power very quickly, that the people like Feder and Marrey are proving, he's growing up in the audience, he's making some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to help him realize the consequences of his actions, and I think it's necessary to get him out of the centre for a while so he can think about them, and that's the best thing for the team and the best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary announces an emergency, closes the border, detains migrants
With the announcement of an emergency, Hungary had crossed the border with Serbia on Tuesday to the southern border and detained those who were trying to enter the country illegally in order to hold the migrant inflow.
There were disorder on the border - hundreds of migrants buried in the border area, which were severely negative by the Serbian authorities.
Having stopped for an indefinite period on the road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing armed violence in their families broke down the tents and were based on that location.
However, dissatisfaction grew.
When they were surrounded by a police helicopter, the migrants shouted, "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian police for a special appointment.
Some objected to the rejection of food and water.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Serbia announced an "inadmissible" expulsion of migrants back from Hungary when they were increasingly arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be a part of the problem rather than a side effect.
Negotiations with Brussels and other countries are needed in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The Hungarian-Serbian elections began the next day after a group of 28 countries had been unable to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to share the overall responsibility for 40,000 people seeking asylum in Italy and Greece, and expressed the hope that a further 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary, would be reached in the future (in the next month or by the end of the year).
The Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel and Austria, on Tuesday, requested the meeting of the Euro Union Extraordinary Summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis that covered the continent.
Hungary, however, does not expect short-term action by Brussels or its neighbours.
On Tuesday, an emergency situation in the two southern regions gave the authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, enabling them to cross the road and speed up the trial of asylum.
Meanwhile, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Ceyarto, said that his country was also planning to bring a pick-up to the border with Romania to cover the flow of migrants across the country, now that it had completed a pick-up on the Serbian border.
Correspondent CBS News Charlie Dagata reported that even prisoners had been engaged in the urgent work to complete the collapsing gap between Hungary and Serbia.
In the past few months, Hungary has become the main “closest place” and the cross-border point of the European Union for displaced persons, many of whom are refugees of war in Syria and the countries of the Middle East.
However, the Prime Minister of the country, Viktor Orban, insists that the majority of people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a better life, not refugees, victims of war who have the right to protection, and this view is strongly divided with the views of other EU countries, i.e. Germany.
The new laws in force in Hungary are now considered to be a crime of crossing or damaging a 4-metre (13-foot) roll-over from the Government ' s southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison terms for the accused of trafficking in persons.
“Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government is declaring an emergency,” said the journalist, a representative of the Zoltan Kovac Government in the southern city of Seged.
We clearly understand that the illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
The formal Parliament still has to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but the reporters of Associated Press who are on the border have already observed the presence of armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Derdy Bakondi, the National Security Adviser of Orbana, reported that 45 persons who tried to cross the border were appointed by the authorities, and 15 others were inside the country.
They have crossed the border and have broken down, are currently under police custody and are accused of administrative violations under new laws.
The authorities are recovering the damage quickly.
On Tuesday morning, the Hungarian authorities also closed two out of seven crossings on the border with Serbia, forcing one of the crossings to be blocked by a railway wagon surrounded by a wheelchair.
The riots set in motion at the main crossing of the border near the city of Røske (Hungary), as the Hungarians had installed a service room for the passage of people inside the metal container, and crowds had forced one another to break in.
Some 20 people were able to enter, and thousands of people remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway leading from Serbia to Hungary and announced that they had refused food and water until they were missed in Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders has been reduced twice in the national survey
Former Secretary-General Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-faced victory for the country's nomination of the Democrats, but Senator Bernie Sanders is pursuing it.
Clinton now has 47 per cent support among primary democratic voters (down from 58 per cent) and Sanders is the second 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Baiden, who has not yet announced his intention to participate in the presidential race, is supported by 15 per cent of the primary democratic voters.
More than five months before the beginning of the competition in the primary elections, the majority of democratic voters said that they were talking too early about what they had been determined to do with the candidate they would support.
The Clinton partners are more confident in their choice than any other candidate.
Since the CBS News survey last month, Clinton has lost support for some demographic groups, and Sanders has earned some bonuses.
Clinton has a great advantage among women and the dead, but it has been reduced.
Her support among men fell significantly, and Sanders stayed away from her at only 5 points.
The preference given by Clinton as a democratic electorate up to 50 years has disappeared, and they and Sanders are now on the same level.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage among senior voters.
Last month, Clinton beat Sanders for a double number of liberals, but Sanders now has the advantage of 5 points in this group.
Almost half of the primary democratic voters throughout the country say that they would gladly support Clinton if she became a candidate for the party.
Fourth would support her with some reservations, and 15 per cent would support her only because she was a candidate.
Six per cent would not support it.
It may not be surprising that the current proponents of Clinton are likely to be more enthusiastic about it.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, the views are more controversial - only about a quarter with enthusiasm would support her.
While 48 per cent of primary democratic voters say that they would be enthusiastic about supporting Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trampe (35 per cent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question why they want to see her candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the necessary experience (16 per cent), then that she is now a female president (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate for this position (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters are also talking about an association linking it to Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It is also called a consensus on issues and a chance to vote.
Since the Vice-President is considering potential election participation, 57 per cent of the primary democratic electorate would like him to join the race, although the third believes he does not.
When asked who they wanted to see in the second place among the candidates from the party, primary democratic voters in most cases called Baiden.
Among the proponents of Clinton, they say that they would choose Baiden the second, that's more than Sanders.
If Byyden decides not to submit his candidacy from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Byyden among the racers to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five per cent of democratic voters saw a candidate in Clinton with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that figure dropped by 78 per cent last month.
Byyden has a high drop in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him to be the most likely candidate has increased.
Nevertheless, in response to the question that is most important in the candidate, democratic voters choose options other than the opportunity to be elected.
Similar to last month's situation, none of the candidates from democracy or potential candidates are unacceptable nominations for these primary voters.
Candidates from democracies, or potential candidates, have shown good results in some key characteristics among primary voters from their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Baiden to be honest and trustworthy people with good leadership.
Byyden of all three leads in honesty, and the strong side of Clinton in her leadership.
Thirty per cent of primary democratic voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and trustworthy, twice as much as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have a certain opinion on him.
The primary democratic voters also generally consider the same ideological views as Clinton, Sanders and Baiden.
On all these measures, about four democratic voters have no opinion on Sanders.
While questions concerning the personal e-mail box and the server at Hillary Clinton continue to be addressed in the home of her Secretary-General, most primary democratic voters are satisfied with its explanation and believe that this has not adversely affected their overall view of it.
But it's a completely different story for the American public in general.
Half of Americans today are not satisfied with her explanation, but only about a third are satisfied.
The public's views on this were divided in March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say that the debate on e-mail had no effect on their overall opinion on Clinton, although 36 per cent said that their views on it had deteriorated.
They're mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10 people who claim that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton was considered to be honest and trustworthy voters from her party, it continued to be a problem for her among registered voters in general: only 32 per cent considered to be honest and trustworthy, at eight points below last month, and at 15 compared to May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not consider it to be honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters throughout the country do not consider the Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump both, however, get good grades on leadership.
Of the six protested candidates, Baden, Carson and Bush show the best results in honesty.
Most people in Sanders see a more honest person than they do, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin for sampling of 351 primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
As a result of the national survey, Ben Carson approached Donald Trampu in a strong way.
Ben Carson joined Donald Tramp in the latest CBS/New York Times survey.
The two candidates elected half of the voters in the new poll, leaving all the others in search of support under their feet.
Voters from all over the country continue to support the Trump, whose support rate has increased from 23 per cent in the recent CBS poll conducted earlier in Fox News last month, to 27 per cent in the poll held on Tuesday.
But Carson flew for the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also showed that Carson benefited from support in all demographic groups by pushing the Trump into a group of Republican voters with higher education.
The remaining candidates, with the exception of Carli Fiorina and Governor Ohio John Kassic, have gone back with Governor Wisconsin Scott Walker, whose support dropped from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Hakabi, and Florida Senator Marko Rubio, hold third place together by 6 per cent.
The error margin for the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey was plus minus 6 per cent, and the survey was conducted in September.
The recent CNN/ORC survey, published last week, showed the growth of Carson in surveys, showing 19 per cent of the Republic's support for Trump with 32 per cent of its support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post survey also showed that the Trump is significantly overrun by Carson.
Because of the increase in Carson's support last week, Trump made several critical incidents to the former neurosurgery, even when Carson apologized for questioning the faith of Trump.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday when the campaign was closed in Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood are charged with the death of Baruch College's first-class student.
About two years after the death of a college student during a ceremony in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, the charge of murder was filed against five people.
"Members of Pi Delta Psi from the New York College of Baruch have brutally attacked Chana Michael Deng during the ceremony in September 2013 and did not deliver him to the hospital in time, which led to his death," they reported to the police.
Officials say that students with eyes tied up and 30-pound backpacks with sand behind their backs have been pushed several times while trying to reach their goals by climbing the surface.
Mr. Deng finally complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood didn't call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and they were waiting for an hour before he was taken to the hospital to speak to the police.
However, they found time to change Deng's clothes, find his symptoms in Google and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the brotherhood, to ask for advice, as Chris Wagner said at the police chief's press conference.
"At this point, the members of the brotherhood began to hide personal property, in essence, by putting the welfare of the brotherhood above Michael Deng's health," said Chief Wagner.
They couldn't save him, and he ended up the next morning.
According to the report on the cover, Deng received several blunt head traumas, torso and torso.
“Very many families have suffered as a result of rituals of brotherhood, as at least one student dies every year, starting in 1970,” said Douglas Fireberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
Brothers and their members must bear responsibility, and this step is very important by the authorities.
Monroe's jury districts turned to the third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Ms. Menga, will be charged with violence against a novelty and a criminal dispute.
"We want to take responsibility not only for individual participants, but if there is an organization that has authorized all of this either officially or informally," Wagner said at the press conference on Tuesday.
College Baruch banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood excluded the local office from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
Increased rates will occur, and the bull market will collapse, bond income will increase and the economy will decline in recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it's going to take before it comes, and how long it's going to continue.
Especially for the economy, history has little to do with time.
The recession took place only 11 months after the first increase in rates and for a total of 86 months.
The stiffness of the Federal Reserve in rising rates often, although not always, determines the response of the economy and financial assets.
The U.S. Central Bank Administration therefore insists so strongly that investors should not focus on when it will start raising rates and on how much adaptation will be required.
In fact, there are many variables in the game.
At the end of the day, however, market participants may find that the entire rate increase is excessive.
"The first increase in the Federal Reserve's rates with a global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the end of the money age," said Julian Jessop, a leading international economic specialist in Capital Economics, in his commentary to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of interest rates to the United States to a more normal but still low levels will be a seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Consider how some areas of the economy could respond to historical trends:
As the market has already seen in the last month or about, the expectation of rising rates may lead to some instability.
When the rate is increased, however, the effects are usually not such dramatic.
"It is not possible to slow down stock revenues for 12-24 months after the first jump, which again probably reflects a delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of the Federal Reserve.
If, in particular, the market for the past 35 years is more rapidly changing - about 14 per cent - in terms of interest increases, it remains sufficiently stable for 250 days (average growth 2.6 per cent), then, after the expiry of 500 days, returns to a normal average income of 14.4 per cent for the last six cycles, according to Bob Doll's recent analysis, the chief trade strategy specialist in Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
In Deutsche it is said that the result for securities is a tendency not to become more pronounced immediately at the rate step, and stock revenues are beginning to decline.
The recessions are a fact of economic life, but rising rates often contribute.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed under conditions that have not existed before and may accelerate the recession.
In general, the gross domestic product will be at almost its lowest point at all times of the higher rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases, the increase in rates since 1950 was only twice the nominal annual GDP of less than 4.5 per cent.
Even though it was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, few people believe it is long, while only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed.
The increase in rates on such a unstable economic background may be risky, and the question “will be the second time,” was reported to Deutsche.
Market participants are preparing to increase the Federal Reserve System's rates all year round, and their views are drawn to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategies and economists believe that FOMC could approve the increase in rates at this meeting, future trade is only 25 per cent probability.
“In our 1950 study, all the rates increases to this day were in the supercycles of increasing financial pressure on GDP, covering peaks before recession, very quickly after recovery,” the report says.
In contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the chosen period.
The current cycle for the moment is the longest that the Federal Reserve System has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record has been 35 months, it has only lasted 74 months and has not yet been completed.
The fixed income has also become unstable while the market is expected to increase rates, and this scenario is in some ways similar to what is being done for shares.
The basic difference is that the effect on bonds will be faster than on shares when the Federal System changes its strategic course.
In the case of bonds, it appears that income changes the vector immediately after the first increase/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the growth rate cycle, the income of bonds falls immediately," Deutsche reports.
Strategy specialists from Charles Schwab believe that rising rates will bring long-term and short-term bonds income levels closer together, making the curve more flat.
High-income bonds often behave better in such a climate, although “we are still afraid of income fluctuations”, says a study by Katy Jones, an income-fixed analysis in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of the federal system ' s policies.
“In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and the falling of inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has been built on the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy”, she wrote.
The interest rates on short-term loans were raised, income growth was more flat, credit advances increased, volatility increased - all market characteristics were strengthened by the Federal System ' s policy.
Generally speaking, companies leading their main business in the United States will win from increasing interest rates and local production will become more attractive.
International debt companies will be worse off because the rising dollar makes their products cheaper in the world market area and their debt cheaper in the financial sector.
"History shows that the "quality" actions demonstrate the efficiency of the market above within three months of the initial increase in rates," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a customer report.
Companies with a stable financial situation have moved companies with a stable rate of 5 per cent in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
High-income companies, as well as low-voltility shares, have also shown better efficiency than low-quality shares, on average, 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
The debt will be a big question.
Companies with a high debt rate lose most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely stock exchange transactions, consumers will benefit from the rising dollar.
Investors could also see profit through higher income, although experts were spending on how fast this would take place.
"BBC Radio 3 - a copy of Classic FM," - adopts a member of Parliament from conservatives Andrew Bingham
A member of Parliament of Conservatives Andrew Bingham criticised the station for "lowing standards"
Proves that it is becoming less and less different from a commercial competitor
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that the prize is just messed with Brits.
A colleague of Parliament Damien Collins, who was offended at The Voice with the same criticism, was not original.
"BBC Radio 3 is becoming a Classic FM," said Parliament's leader, encouraging the broadcaster to prove that she does anything that commercial companies do not do.
A member of Parliament from conservatives Andrew Bingham also told the BBC, which seems to be the public radio station "stupid" and becomes increasingly distinct from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "simplification" - but it seems to turn into a Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards prize launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something else, here's two examples that first came to my mind, in which you're actually just copying what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General of BBC rejected the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 was moving far ahead of his commercial rival when it came to live music and auditory education.
What I know about Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anywhere else.
And his devotion to live speech and the creation of music will not really compare with anyone else.
"It is also very important, I think, that Radio 3 is interested in finding new music and promoting new productions," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio Manager 3 Alan Davy claimed that radio stations had to work a lot more to attract audiences than in the past, because the British were less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only child of BBC who was attacked by five commercial competitors during the hearings of the Ad Hoc Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
A member of the Parliament of Tori Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical show of talents that BBC bought at the Dutch Talpa Media at a cost of 22 million pounds in the orientation.
See why this programme is often discussed in connection with the lack of originality and distinctions?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, in which Paloma Fate and Boy George participate as judges, was done in a typical BBC style.
He added what he wanted from the Corporation to "find a hit in his own home stable" next time she started a fun project.
However, it does not consider it necessary to prevent the creation of the new The Voice seasons in the future or the use of money for those paying the license fee to other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales growth has slowed most in August, and that may be why Black Friday
The first three months of 2015 saw an increase in online sales by seven per cent
Last month, the slowest growth has been observed since it began to be observed in 2000.
Online sales increased three years ago using mobile shopping devices
Experts are convinced that the November Black Friday could contribute to the cost reduction
For about ten years, virtual shopping has been undergoing boom, turning many central streets in Britain into ghost cities.
But experts say that there have now been signs of online sales equations, after the latest data showed only a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total online shopping expenditures in August have shown minimal growth since they began to be fixed in 2000 with only five per cent increase.
Experts say that there have now been signs of online sales equations, after the latest data showed only a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rate in previous years and go back to 2000, they have always found a reasonable explanation," said Guardian Andy Malkehi, editor of the IMRG Sales Index.
He explained that online sales had intensified three years ago when buyers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people had the opportunity to buy online, and that they could do so under any circumstances, such as sitting on the couch.
But now it goes to the plate, and you can see the decrease (growth).
The phenomenon of the Black Friday, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the delay in sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying prior to the event that took place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, buyers made a five-fold increase in the average speed with computers to benefit from offers, thus interrupting a number of sales websites.
Experts believe that the Black Friday, when buyers enter the present fight for profitable purchases, could keep people from shopping.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, more than 1 pound of sterling per 5 is spent online.
With regard to goods such as televisions and stereos, more than one third of them are sold through the Internet store.
At the same time, more than four people buy clothes and shoes online more readily than in fashion stores in central streets.
Muslims protect those killed when the crane falls in Mecca, and the Ben Laden family is subject to sanctions.
Muslims carry 29 dead bodies on the streets, as first funerals begin in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partly blamed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the accident
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 persons were also injured after the collapse of the crane
Hundreds of Muslims have been on the streets to bury 29 of the victims killed as a result of the collapse of the crane on the main mosque of Mecca.
Clothing mainly in the whites present at the funerals was half the journey to pay tribute to the first of the dead who went on their last trip to the Al-Moaisem warehouse.
The seal process went beyond the sacred place, where the former construction crane had broken down and fallen on its proponents for several days.
The bodies were released for burial, and at the same time, the King of Saudis was excavating a construction company belonging to the Ben Laden family for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 persons who died in the destruction of the skull in the Main Mosque carried on the streets
Among those who died were the father of the four children, Cassim Akram from Bolton, the Great Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage to the palace when the crane was broken.
Mr. Akram was in the Main Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual haja.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hague in Mecca will continue, as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Solomon stated that Binladin Group should not have left a crane shot on the ground with a non-working crane.
The Arab version of the decree issued by the Saudi Press State Agency states that Binladin Group is partly guilty of a violation.
The English edition of the news agency did not mention this detail, but reported that the company's leaders had been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Solomon promised to identify the cause of the cranial collapse in the main mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims arrived to go to the haja this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the collapse of the crane and its representatives were not available for comments.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and of inadequate harmonization of action with the meteorological service.
Tens of cranes are surrounded by the main mosque of Mecca, as part of the extensive construction work conducted by Binladin Group.
For decades, the Ben Laden family has been one of the closest rulers of Saudi Arabia and has managed major construction projects.
The late leader of al-Qaida Usama bin Laden was a son-in-law whose family rejected in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in strong winds and rain only a few days before millions of people came to the kingdom to participate in the palace, which is binding at least once in their lives for every skilled Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 people remained in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million Real Estates (about $174 000) to relatives of the deceased, and the same amount was irrevocable.
The remaining victims will receive half of that amount.
Chapter B&Q argues that the trend is due to the presence of small-scale European masters
According to Veronica Lori, the British are increasingly hiring repair specialists
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is growing
Results - Opening more than 200 new Screwfix stores for professionals
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores all over the country.
Author: Rupert Steiner, city correspondent Daily Mail
They speak, the British put on the side of milk and malaria, and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to carry out domestic work
If you are able to deal with a mole or a beautify the walls, you seem to be in a minority in our day.
Because, according to the owner of B&Q, the British are increasingly recruiting specialists to carry out uncomplicated work at home.
Veronica Lori, the new Director-General of Kingfisher, who owns the house-building services network, reported that this trend is accompanied by a significant flow of skilled East European teachers offering minimum-cost services.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in the goods for masters while closing 60 B&Q stores.
Ms. Lori said that she wanted to see more women in B&Q shop staff since eight out of ten procurement decisions in the store were made by weak sex representatives.
Most of the staff are men at present.
According to her, there was no indication of the recent demographic trends that there was a growing number of single-woman households that were more involved in housing than in the past.
Mrs. Lori said, "Our stores still work mostly for men.
Steps must be taken to achieve the balance sheet.
In general, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on the goods purchased are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Lori, one of five women in the role of leading British companies, whose shares are taken into account in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the team of top managers from among directors of the equal number of men and women.
Kingfisher is the only company in which 50 per cent of managers are women, including the Director General and Finance.
Mrs. Lori said, "This was a conscious decision, diversification, an important issue for us.
It was not difficult to find suitable women in the board of directors.
After the group had incurred the costs of closing shops, Kingfisher had shown a decrease in revenues and sales in half a year.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, owned by Screwfix and B&Q, opens 200 new shops
Time of decision on the Federal Reserve interest rate
The world observed a meeting held by the Federal Reserve Bank, which discussed the decision to raise or not a percentage for the first time in the last decade over two days.
The 80 economists survey conducted by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would do so last week now believe that it would still be temporary and maintained at the current level of 0-0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve reduced the rate to zero.
For the first time, we approach the fact that the main bank may move from a zero point of view and begin the process of normalizing interest rates," said Ánhel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
The U.S. economy is working effectively, economic recovery adds trillion dollars to the balance sheet and inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision affects the world economy.
He warned markets that they should be prepared for change, but they were all about their confidence that all odds against such a move would be met.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
A new Balkan route: refugees go to the EU through Croatia.
"Open!" -- hundreds of refugees are scanning at the Horgosh checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
On Tuesday, Budapest crossed the border for the displaced.
The asylum seekers have already begun to circumvent other routes in the Euro Union.
One of them lies in the closed border with Serbia across Romania.
The second is through Croatia and Slovenia in Austria.
According to some data, buses that have taken refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the city of Shida on the Croatian border.
The leaders were ordered from the authorities to follow without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stepanovic assures that his country is doing everything in its power to help refugees, but its capacity is limited:
Our work is to ensure Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to maintain a humane attitude toward them.
But this is already a common European problem.
It is not easy to deal with, no country in Europe alone will be able to do so, and the smaller country, such as Serbia, will not be able to do so.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open the border for refugees who do not want to remain in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is unscrupulous:
If someone is called a refugee, he must fill in the necessary documents in Serbia.
And if he doesn't, he won't leave us in our country, because Serbia is safe.
Hungary has already conducted 175-tykilometers on the border with Serbia.
But the Orban is not going to stop: it plans to bring the same landing on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Maemarakis: "Europe wants to help us."
Vangelis Maymarakis has been a member of the law centre governments for several years, which, in the opinion of the left, have led the country to a financial crisis.
Now he has become a temporary leader of the New Democracy Party, which challenges Cyprus.
A few days before the elections, he met with the journalist Evronius.
Euronews: Mr. Mayrakis, welcome to Euronews!
Vangelis Maimarakis: Thank you for your invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a devastating defeat by joining the SIRIZA coalition, but now, according to the polls, the New Democracy was compared to it by popularity.
What's changed during this time?
Vangelis Maymarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Cyprus lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget profit and prospects for economic growth.
Now the country has a budget deficit and a high level of unemployment.
The investors left because Mr. Cyprus chased them.
In the last nine months, the Greek have had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises of Mr. Cyprus.
And now they can easily compare what they promised with what actually happened.
Daily life was much worse than in January when the situation improved, with most Greek citizens.
Euronews: But you are saying that if you win the election, you will strive for alliances with other parties, including SIRIZ.
Vangelis Maymarakis: The case is that, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is not a coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still in operation, political forces and all the ruling parties have gathered together to implement the programme they have agreed to, without rejecting their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that, at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will enable the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in support of the agreement between Mr. Cyprus and the country's creditors.
If you become a new prime minister on Monday, will you comply with this agreement, or will you try to change it at least partially?
Vangelis Maymarakis: In fact, we voted in favour of Greece's movement on the European road, because we are well aware of the devastating consequences that would result from the country's departure from the EU.
Now Europe is helping us by granting subsidies to our farmers for their production, we have solidarity funds, the Unioner package and banking aid.
All of this would have been lost if it had not been a treaty with Europe.
But the current harsh economic measures have resulted in Mr. Cyprus being negotiated.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that, during the first year, the new Greek Government wants to order, acts in a rational manner and realizes that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am sure that all commitments that cannot be fulfilled because of the recession can be negotiated again but only after a certain time.
It would be a mistake to believe that we can return to negotiations with our creditors in the first year of the new agreement, as they expect full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to regain their confidence, we must continue the privatisation, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed upon, and continue to benefit from EU funding and the great investment opportunities that we need to open up for a better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, in the course of the negotiations, the Government of Cyprus has not presented any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we have identified by discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example of farmers' income.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the Cyprus ministers had never talked about it.
In other words, the Greek ministers were not prepared and badly informed, so they failed to negotiate and concluded a failed agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon be on a table with Mr. Juncker, Mr. Holland, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them be different from what your predecessor Antonis Samaras told them?
Vangelis Maymarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014, we have tried best to implement the 2012 agreement, covering the sharp corners.
We have made progress on reform.
Of course, we did not grasp the urgency and speed needed, but we acted in an emergency.
The market had fallen, and potential buyers were not visible, ready to pay the price of the Greek Government.
At the time, I was the speaker of Parliament, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups, which were then the majority of the government.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a working parliament, which was in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations abroad.
And we managed to bring the country into a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the early universal elections that resulted from the December presidential elections.
Euronews: The mass flow of refugees has been in Greece for the past few weeks.
What do you think about this situation and the reactions of the European countries that these people are seeking?
Vangelis Maemarakis: The refugee crisis is a slow-acting bomb with which we have to deal after the election.
And the reason is that the Government of SIRIZA did not act in this situation as it did.
Such issues should be addressed because if you have a problem, only emergency measures remain.
And we're in this situation right now.
Even the temporary Government, which has replaced SIRIZ, has done more in seven days than Mr. Cyprus did in seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the temporary Government, which the President of the Republic is very valuable in providing the EU summit, will enable us to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country, and note that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some of the extraordinary events that have occurred with them.
The issue has a deep humanitarian dimension, and we will stick to the position that European policies must adopt in this new situation.
The relevant decision should be taken at the EU summits, and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination of action, more effective border control and refugee reception centres.
We also need to make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to deal with this pressing problem.
Mr. Mayrakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Maimarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful city of Druzkovka Donecka, during the day, the police chief's criminal investigation officers in the area together with military counter-research have established and detained a suspect, 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the city of Kriva Rog (Dnepropervoj) who earlier in the evening during the joint use of alcoholic beverages, and the conflict in the village of Verhenetorek in the Yasinovat region of Donetchina has fired the car into his opponent.
The 22-year-old boy was reported from a hospital where he was hospitalized with cross-fired leg injuries.
As told by Artem Vassicki, the Deputy Chief of Criminal Investigations of the Military Head of the Area, during the conduct of operational actions, the law enforcement officers proved their involvement in another serious criminal offence, the killing of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
The operatives found that on the same day, a conflict occurred between the suspect and another local resident, resulting in a man having a fatal gunshot wound in his head.
Criminal proceedings under the articles “Dead Murder” and “Dead Damage of Serious Body” of the Criminal Code of Ukraine are open to prosecution by Druzkovsky GO.
The detainee is threatened with imprisonment for up to 15 years.
The figure was detained and placed in a temporary detention locker and reported to the Donecko area in the press service.
Two inhabitants of Novosibirska, who decorated several Soviet monuments in the colour of the Ukrainian flag, including two memories of Vladimir Lenin, were sentenced by the Russian court to prison.
Two more inhabitants of the city were sentenced to restrictions on freedom.
The inmates of Novosibirska are sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years in prison.
Two other convicted persons received a 14- and 18-month limitation.
The Lenin court of Novosibirska recognized the four citizens as guilty of vandalism against Lenin's monuments, which were located on the territory of the CRC and on the Trichotage Street, as well as the monument of Slava.
In the latter case, the rocket plant Katuusha and tank T-34 were decorated.
Remember, on the night of 12 December, the Russian Novosibirsk, unknown to the Ukrainian flag, decorated the military technique at the Slavic Monument.
The civil wife of the popular Russian actor Evgenia Siganova Irina Leonova gave birth to the seventh child.
The girl appeared in the light at a Moscow clinic.
The New Year's and her mom feel good.
Remember, Siganov and Leon had recently broken up.
Eugenies from commentaries are denied.
Irina blames her husband and his ambitions on everything.
Evgênção is 36 years old.
He's an actor in the Moscow Theatre "Master Peter Fomenko".
It's known for the movie "Sproulka", "Cosmos as a Preception", "Brist Fortress", "Ottepel" and "Farza".
On 8 September, Evgenie Siganov was recognized as “Acture of the Year” and “Celve of the Year” in the Russian version of the popular magazine GQ.
A man who opened fire at Delta State University left an apology note
After the shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note stating that he was sorry for the first murder and would like to “return everything back”, the authorities reported on Tuesday.
Police in Gotie, Mississippi, reported that the professor of geography and public science at Delta State University called 911 about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he told me he shot someone.
Lamb told the dissident that the police had to send people to him at home.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there's a dog in the house that "no one is throned," but probably upset.
The police were interested in the name of the caller, but he didn't call it.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened a gun.
Upon entering the scene of the crime, the police found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41 years old, and a note written by the hands of Lamb, 45 years old, saying, "I'm sorry I'd like to return everything back.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb went 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, and on Monday evening, when the police surrounded him, he ended up with him.
University Rector William Laford reported that he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb obviously had something on his mind."
Despite the information received on Monday that Lamb suggested a novel between Prentiss and Schmidt, official services reported on Tuesday that “there was no information or evidence” of the “love triangle”.
O Prentiss responded as "good man" Sean O'Stin, who reported having been married to her for about seven years.
They were divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Stin told me that he and Prentiss had a daughter of 19 and that she was "unsatisfied."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Lindsey Noulz, which San Gerald calls a close friend of Prentiss, the last one worked from home via the Internet.
Nouls told me that Prentiss had a hunting dog on the Litning phone and that she had met Lamb for about three years.
Nools said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called his family on Monday to say, "He won't go to prison."
On the same night when the police hit him on a "1" show near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot himself there.
According to a summary on the university site, in spring 2015, Lamb received a degree of doctor of pedagogy at Delta State University.
The Stars That Lost Their Success
Actor (left), in a photo with his son Redmond (right), survived several difficult years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and in 2009 he lost his multi-year lifelong companion, Farru Fossett, who died of cancer.
The actor was reported to have also suffered from drug addiction and was arrested for drug trafficking in 2008.
All of this certainly played a role.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United went out for a few months due to a double break.
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the Battle of the Champions League, in which Manchester United lost PSV in Endhoven.
While the defender is living in this regard, which will not be able to go to the field for at least six months, Louis van Gal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again in this season.
Trauma took place during the foolish sub-pocket of Hector Moreno at the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw turned into a PSV criminal zone.
He was assisted in the field for nine minutes and was given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gal said, "He has a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
They'll take him to Manchester tomorrow or the day after, and then they'll operate.
This terrible--the young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcome great difficulties and became fantastic, and here it happened.
There was an oxygen mask in the compartment.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double break, it's for six months, and the guy can't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again in this season.
Moreno's lucky he didn't get a red card, and he didn't get a pen.
Arbitr Nikola Ricoli didn't punish the Mexicans.
Van Gal thinks the Italian judge made a mistake.
You judge yourself when I say it's worth a pen and a red card.
It was a very bad two-legged subcavate.
In his tweet, Shaw writes, "Thank you all for your messages, don't describe how I'm devastated, my path to recovery begins, I'm going back harder than I was."
More on: Manchester United suffers from an accident with Luke Shaw in a game with PSV
The English defender will have an additional incentive to move to the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Koku, coach PSV, said, "This is a very serious trauma."
When any game goes through with such a trauma, it's all very upset.
That was never the intention of our players to hurt the opponent.
Moreno took a break when playing for Mexico against the Dutch team led by Van Gala to the 2014 World Cup.
"He's very hard now because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it's a very serious trauma, you feel bad," Koku said.
I couldn't see for myself.
The only thing I could see was the ball that flew in the other direction, so it looked as if he (Morno) had touched it, but I didn't see the sub at Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to carry it.
I'm so sorry, and I'm so sorry.
Andres Guardado from PSV was also delivered to the hospital after meeting Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Lorakse?
Every parent adopts one thing very quickly: if your child likes a book, it'll be a while before you know it almost sucks.
We'll see if you're not David Cameron.
In response to the question of the representative of the childcare organization in the canycula, the Prime Minister chose the "Lorax" for his favorite children's book, a story with an environmental cover written by Dr. Suez in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, wrote Cameron in a comment published on the SuperCamps site, and continues: "This is a fun, touching, unusual story with a strong message I like to read to my children, because it always contains any image or message we miss."
And it would be all right, except the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to be reversing the content of the book, but in fact, he is talking about the content of a single film taken in 2012 with new characters and details added to the rather short original narrative.
"In the surrounding high walls of the city of Vernuzwil, where there was no green and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey--the girls of his dream, having fulfilled her wish--to see this tree," we read in the text a description of the love story of Dr. Suzu (now called Theodore Suez Gazel), who died in 1991.
If this is not quite suspicious, Cameron's text is read almost as a short presentation of the film "Lorax", posted on the Internet Movie Database: "In the surrounding high walls of the city of Versusville, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dream."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, generally recognized as an active parent, was so unfamiliar with the contents of a book that the unnamed boy knew about how the environmental destroyer of the unscrupulous tree cutter and prisoner Nachodkins, despite the protests of Loraks (the name of the book) was a funny substance with the juices that “talked on behalf of trees”.
Most likely, such an uncomplicated PR assignment was commissioned by an executive who had never read a child's book on Loraks 20 times a day.
The representative of Downing Street stated that the text was allegedly received from the Cameroon office in the electoral district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's headquarters, but no further comments were followed.
For Adam Lit, there was a clear risk of not getting into England, but it was still a difficult question.
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a simple task, but if you look at the collection that England has chosen for this tour, the repetition of the 3-0 test series that happened last time seems unlikely to me.
I would also not exclude the victory in my field.
Alister Cook's team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but it includes players who are virtuosoly taking rounds and collective thinking strongly; they will not bring with them scars from 2012 but only a young man's position.
Moen Ali's ball is turned into a ball baller, and Adil Rushid, even if he's an unknown figure for the test level, is an offensive option.
More on the subject: Adam Lit came out of England on a test cricket and was replaced by Alex Heilz
The decision to exclude Adam Lit to me, his master coach in Yorkshire, is of course difficult to analyze.
His seven test-mates had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the obvious but harsh reality was that the players in the cricket were judged by the judges as a result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I have already said this earlier) players are best chosen themselves.
The couple were half-hearted, and Lithuania could have waited for a longer career, but he was in charge of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
The chief coach of England's gathering, Trevor Baileys, responded well to his mood, even when he didn't show what he was capable of, and that didn't surprise me; he was first a command player and then everything else.
The question of how long it will take before the batsman of the test cricket will leave an impression on himself is a difficult question.
Lit played seven games like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton was nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and on a foreign field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trout for the Caribbean League when Lit was in the best form, but this lost opportunity is already in the past.
It's Alex Hayles, and he's the Batman I appreciate.
He's an unpredictable cricketer that we saw at the Yorkshire Club at the beginning of this season when he won 236 in a match against us at Trent Bridge, which was already something.
It should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but it would, of course, depend on the composition of the OAU team.
The idea of placing Moena next to Cook as an opening batsman, which would allow for the introduction of an additional spindle, keeping four speed boulevards, is thought out, and I am not against it at all.
I don't see why the game won't be able to kick the ball, and the left has already shown that he's a damn good cricketer.
Moon may not be exactly what it takes for his county of Woostershire, but it's the third number for them, and there's no big difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 test match "third Batsman" before leaving as opening in 2001.
He won three hundred at once and didn't look.
Zafar Ansari comes into the gathering as a reserve spinner, and with my immediate company, he showed me a very promising young man.
People can look at his sample statistics -- on average 31 by beat and 35 by ball -- and think it's a risky rate, but among the voters who voted for a little, and chose youth.
He'll learn a lot in this tour.
In addition to the collection, England plans to make a few practical supplements in the training system.
The appointment of Mahela Jayourdin, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for test-mates could be a master's move.
He's one of the best guys for the game, which will bring in the richest experience of all possible conditions and any attacks.
Paul Collingwood is included in the game where a white ball is used, and it will provide both energy and unsanitary speed in the set.
I have always felt that he was born to be involved in international crickets, whether play or coaching, and like Mahela, he has little intelligence.
Sometimes new votes in the divide, even if they say what has already been said, may add new forces to the team.
Colleague of the Darem Ben Stokes team has been left alone, Ruth has been granted a similar break with Australia, and I, for example, do not have any problems with this.
While not all agree, coaches and players do not define a schedule.
And you should remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easy.
The UK-based exit camp can win if the economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron's unscrupulous policy to resume negotiations on Britain's maintenance in the EU is becoming increasingly difficult every day, even without seeing the choice of Gen. Jeremy, "Is this a yes or no?" -- Corbin as leader of the Laborists or the TUC's malnutrition about Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbins and Nigel Faraji.
The friendly European diplomat explained on the days when the current situation in the EU, which is experiencing a variety of crises, is not all of its own production, that some countries are bound by the British egocentric agenda, with the concessions and subversive agreements that they do not want to make.
Upon meeting in Briton for an annual meeting, TUC decided that he would not want them at all if they destroyed social protection.
We could even call it the "Deave and George Self-Programme."
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are crammed at the summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photographing themselves in front of a well-known local monument, in or without local celebrities, then coming home and saying that they are attracting allies to reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who is interested in maintaining external contacts with Britain under the auspices of the European Union - "Don't leave us with France," says Berlin - suggests that the ministers and officials in some capitals come to understand when they get the same thing, we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, a very careful Chancellor of Germany, is an ally, but she is in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before the situation worsens, as it has worsened for those sitting in her seat Tetcher (11 years), Mitterran (14) and Kolya (16).
France's head, François Holland, is facing a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing power, too.
Poland could soon receive the nationalist right-wing government, Spain left-wing.
It is difficult to see them coming from the skin of the van to help the self-britches whose energy could be wasted to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, which they do not want, because most of them have similar separatist trends.
So some of these ministers can even plan to release deliberately useless SNP-style diamonds during the UK referendum campaign in 2017 to boost the process of leaving the EU, my friend suggests.
"The review was an idea-fix" and "British has no value from the renewed negotiations".
Europeans are aware of the theft of the Fleet Street, and how skeptical of the EU are the media, unlike the time of Tony Benn's 1975 referendum, which supported our entry in 1973 with a 2:1 ratio.
They can hardly recall Boris Johnson, the co-ordinated Euro opportunist, who celebrated his "direct EU bananas" by the Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his nonsense, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a company of fearsome julian taxes, phone hackers, and pseudo-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was quite the same about them, but he was aware that when you're in a giant gorilla cell, you have to give her bananas to get her out and not let her eat you in a chain and tea again.
In fact, Milliband was more committed to Blair than Blair himself in opposing Cameron's idea of a referendum, since Blair was in favour of the rejected EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who issued him a winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him.
But my dear Jeremy Corbin, who got me in the back of Westminster on Monday -- I told him he had no time to spend on me -- seems to be risking repeating the strategy of Neil Kinnock, the "boy of Merdoku" of the '80s -- a mistake and then, and now.
This may take time, but it must develop a consistent strategy of interaction with the press - not with me, but exactly with Andrew Marrom, on which he sat at the VVC on Sunday.
The official position of the Corbin on Europe is that I call evolution a delicate one.
He said he would like us to remain in the reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the traditionalist trend of Ukip and a wider circle of “little Anglia’s sidewalks” can probably say “yes”.
It's the same as Hillary-Benn, but not Bennit-Benn said on the radio and TV this week, while his internal fighter was refusing to admit that the appointment of Corbin of the naughty John McDonnell as a "dark" minister of finance was a bad idea.
This reminded me of the 1970s when his old father, Iso, fought on TV for being disloyal to colleagues in the Laborist Cabinet, not going too far and not losing his position in the Cabinet of Ministers.
Hillary's battle was more attractive.
But the fight to remain "under any circumstances" is not what McDonnell was saying, and not what J. K. was saying to Pera and Members of Parliament at a private meeting on Monday evening, in general opinion.
To tell the democracy and his "boy" Corbin - remember, he has throned even me - the discipline of the messages remains important in the century of round-the-clock television seven days a week, and especially in the watercourse of social networks, the sights of paranoia and betrayal.
It is reasonable not to allow Cameron to separate as simply from Europe, allowing him to accept as proper the support of the Laborists during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But the main mistake of McDonnell and Corbin's EU membership - in the "Bennit" economy of siegeed fortress - is no longer the issue of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for which narcissism, born of minor differences, is the central principle in dogmatic disputes.
With regard to his mistake about NATO, Tom Watson is sure that J.K. will not hesitate to leave, foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to bring this to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital -- they also have suspicious voters -- on the British side when it can be pointless?
The US$ is already very disappointed by the weak military actions of British people in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Government of the South will cut off the costs, as I was reminded on Monday during the chain at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticise the review of electronic cigarettes by Public Health England
Statements by the Government of the Agency that electronic cigarettes were 95 per cent less harmful than smoking were heard at a meeting of 12 people, some of whom were related to the tobacco industry as reported by the researchers.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet criticised the evidence used by the Public Health England (PHE) in their electronic cigarettes report.
PHE published an important report - "reversive mass" last month, calling it "a comprehensive review of evidence".
But some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the link between some experts and the tobacco industry.
In the editorial article in Lancet's medical journal last month, the "extremely shocking argument" was criticised by PHE for its main conclusion.
Two other researchers were asked in article BMJ whether these statements were “strong or false grounds”.
Martin McKi, a professor of European health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, reported: “The fundamental principle of health should be based on evidence of effectiveness”.
According to them, the public expects that PHE's statements that “current best estimate shows that electronic cigarettes are approximately 95 per cent less harmful than tobacco” were based on a detailed discussion of evidence and modelling.
This is, in fact, the only meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a multi-criteria analysis of decision-making in order to summarize their views on the harm of various non-containing products; the results of the meetings are briefed in scientific publications.
Macki and Capewell reported that a company named EuroSwiss Health was one of the sponsors of the meeting, whose director-general was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
It also confirmed the health certificates of BAT in the report on sustainable development.
One of the 12 persons at the meeting announced funding from the manufacturer of electronic cigarettes, not mentioning the funding he reportedly received from the tobacco company Philip Morris earlier.
There was no reasonable explanation for the selection of members of the Council, but there were several known supporters of electronic cigarettes, some of which also reported funding for the industry in the publication.
It is not known whether other participants have experience in tobacco management.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco manager at PHE.
The scientific article, published by the group, “is inextricably agreed” that there is a lack of “high evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria”, wrote McCi and Capewell.
However, none of these links and limitations were affected in the PHE report.
Macki and Capewell said that PHE's statements that "at present there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are expensive, bringing children or non-smoking," were premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Head of Health and Welfare at PHE, said that BMJ ' s statements had already been answered.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are much less harmful than tobacco."
One of the two smokers died from his passion.
All the evidence suggests that the health threats from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the remote effects.
PHE has a clear responsibility to inform the public about what they prove and what they do not prove, especially where the public had doubts about the relative risk of tobacco.
About 80,000 people die of smoking-related diseases each year, while NHS is 2 billion pounds per year.
Clearly, although electronic cigarettes are not safe, they are only part of the harm that smoking causes, we are carrying out our tasks before the nation.
Former Head of Channel 4 believes BBC should stop the EastEnders series
The former head of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that BBC should end the release of programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would have much to do for a successful show such as the charity of the Albert Square.
Johnson noted that licensing fees should only be used to create programmes that are not issued by other British broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for putting a public broadcast, which is probably only a small part of the audience, for peak airtime when competitors go to a high-rated show, and for channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General Tony Hall said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noted that he had failed in his six years of cooperation with BBC during the work on Channel 4.
"I cannot separate myself from the view that the BBC is preparing to launch and broadcast a transmission that could show competing companies that do not receive subsidies," Johnson told members of the Committee on Communications of the House of Lords in an analysis of the future fate of the BBC.
If you keep a licence collection that I do not consider to be a good medium- and long-term solution, companies should leave only those programs that are not issued and are not to be issued by other companies.
The Voice show goes into the air in the premium slot because the creators want to get as much support as possible for the future.
The idea of no one showing it anymore is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I do not understand why regressive taxes should go to funding transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; they are known to be their own production.
Other channels would no doubt give a lot of money to her.
I don't understand how this can be a public message.
I don't think that'd somehow bring down the BBC.
The Senior Entrepreneur Johnson, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused BBC of pursuing ratings “because of the ambitions of staff members and because of their faith that this is the best way to gain long-term support”.
His comments on the most popular show on BBC are addressed by Executive Director Sky Tony Bolla, who, in his lecture on the memory of McGagart in Edinburgh in 2003, invited BBC to sell EastEnders series.
Johnson noted that the lower transmissions of the BBC's public character "are continuing to go to BBC4, where it is often not possible to assess the audience, but therefore the function of the company is carried out, and this can be presented as an argument in the Canadian sermons justifying the income of the 4 billion-pound licensing fees: "Yes, of course, we are doing all these undetectable transfers that no one sees."
They put them in a slot where no one will ever see them.
Regarding the licensing gathering, Johnson informed the Committee: "I call on you to find a more regressive system as to who will get the most out of it.
Of course, you all think that we all think 150 pounds a year is a huge amount, but for people who have 150 pounds a lot of money, I'm curious, because they don't really watch and listen to the BBC.
The former Executive Director of Sky and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also spoke before the committee last Tuesday, said that BBC should review Rita's mission for information, education and entertainment.
He noted that only a small part of the BBC material released is now formally classified as educational - according to him, it is 1% of the television content and 0.1% of the radio - and that the company should welcome the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the theme “Information, Education and Entertainment”.
On Elstein's partnership, the BBC noted that more efforts should be made in such areas as "Promenade Concerts" (only part of them, he said, are on TV) and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for online viewing.
"Songenetics" enables brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows that there is no change in direction at the moment when they are affected by sound impulses.
Scientists have removed worms from a genetically modified nervous system, which can be managed using sound waves.
No shortcomings change the direction of movement at a time when they are affected by sound impulses too high so that the human ear can hear them.
The impulses are affected by the activation of neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
More on: Researchers manage brain activity through light
Scientists have said that worms demonstrate the potential of a new technique called sonogenesis, the subject of which is the use of ultrasound to initiate certain cells of the brain, the heart and the brain, and the source of ultrasound is outside the body.
Schrikant Chalasani, a scientific officer at the Institute of Solka, La-Hoya, California, told the Guardian that this method could once replace the deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to the human brain and used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Red nematodes usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they began to react when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles were boosting ultrasonic waves that then penetrated the worm’s body.
Increased ultrasound waves affect the structures called “TRP-4 ion channels” found in the membranes of some worm cells.
The ultrasonic wave forces these ion channels to open and trigger the cells associated with them is reported in the Nature Communications report.
In order to create the neutrons that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic changes to worms, so their motor neurons used the ion channels TRP-4.
During the use of ultrasound to affect modified organisms, the sound waves were increased by microscopic bubbles and entered the worms by activating modified motor neurons.
This method is similar to the one used in the "optogenetics" - a new direction that allows scientists to include and exclude neurons with light impulses.
Chalasani argues that, compared to this method, sonogenetics may have some advantages.
Unlike the light that is being delivered to the right part of the brain by the eyelid, low-frequency ultrasonic waves pass through the tissues of the body, so their delivery does not need to be carried inside the skull box.
“We believe that, in order to treat certain neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will eventually make human neurons sensitive to ultrasound,” Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the methodology could apply to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
Prohibited torture equipment is directly on your threshold!
Advertising announcements are published on British arms trade
Consider the role of Amnesty International in protest against the display of weapons.
Screaming drones!
Ruining iron chains!
Missile bombs!
Electric light-dumps that cause unbearable pain, but do not leave traces!
The bold voice and cartoons leave no doubt that this ad of the largest international exhibition of arms is the same parish prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the British Government's intention to "press" weapons against repressive regimes, using the ExCeL centre in the Doklands by the exhibition of defence technologies and security systems.
More on: DSEI Arms Exhibition: Authorizing regimes go to London
But the special campaign also leads to a sudden number of posters at bus stops and in subways that need to be looked at again.
"A major announcement coming from DLR from 15 to 18 September?" is written on one of them by the London metro with a DLR line that turns into a tank silhouette.
In September this year, a crowd of arms dealers will burn on the DLR line. Passengers are asking for help to prevent the display of weapons.
300 posters are drawn by artists who have shown their work at the "Museum of Cruel Design" in the Banki Park "Dismalland".
The Special Patrol Group has helped to spread them across London using the “supplier of advertising sites”, a six-pound set of mobile keys, which is said to provide “access to about a third of the advertising space on the bus stops of the planet”.
Transporters in London were not pleased with such "vandalism" as unauthorized posters.
One of the paramilitary announcements issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Greendon, the curator of Cruel Designs and the teacher at Essex University, artists are becoming more demanding and are striving to bring political art to the auditorium outside the gallery.
Many artists start working with Protestant activists, realizing that they have to go to a real world because of their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the exhibition of weapons welcoming passengers in the subway.
A video from Amnesty was screened over 100,000 times per 24 hours on Facebook and was created by a VCCP agency working pro bono, involving graphic designer and sound artist working for free.
The creative director of VCCP Matt Lever was defeated with a commercial silence around the arms show, with a break in ExCel calendar, and thought, "Let them set up a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They thought of creating more realistic and illogical corporate advertising, but “filling her home with bright colors and animation became more exciting”.
"They have helped us incredibly to attract attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition," says Tom Davis of Amnesty.
We now need the British Government to take action and to ensure that this torture equipment will not be illegally sold directly at our threshold.
Perhaps the most creative art on the subject of arms is within ExCeL, where participants trade fantastically euphemistic products.
In the Saab press release, information on the order for "AT4CS RS for shoulder shooting" came from the U.S. Army.
It includes “an unparalleled cumulative weaponry that produces an uninterrupted barrier within the target”.

Eight golden rules for living in student settlements
It's been 11 years since I moved to the student community as a normal 19-year-old, still believing in betrothal and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the smiles of those I've offended - and the many, long-standing complaints of others.
Most of what I learned can be broken down by eight simple rules.
Transfers to the community can range from a mild to an absolutely scary nerve.
He encourages me to talk to people about where you've been, whether you've taken an academic leave or where you've taken it, whether you support Corbin and why you're "honorly, I don't love, I don't hate Marmite, because, seriously, you guys, it's just a hiccup extract, I'm gonna be in myself."
Take a breath.
And help others to move, too, ask questions and show interest.
This helps you find people you like, not those you don't even talk to, even if the rest of you were burned and the fires were distributed.
Give people space.
People’s rooms are often turned into drinking establishments, movie theaters, and public places, but they are also the places where people dress and repair the lower whites.
More on the subject: Don't even think about starting college with relationships
Introverts at universities are unfair.
Your room must be a place of refuge, but many communities form a culture of Satan from one room to another, which promotes friendship, society and leads to long friendship.
It could be a hell of a man trying to restore power.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to keep dating you, but I need you to leave, and I have been able to restore the energy I've spent on communicating with you."
Try to feel as if the contestant is tired of the community - and not to knock on it, but to send a text message.
I mean, knock: do it.
One man in my neighborhood followed the principle: If the door was not locked, he was invited to come in.
He saw something.
Make friends by means of a firefight.
Since you're starting a university life at the peak of the Bake-Off show, you're going to knock on the door to people to introduce and teach a bunch of chocolate cake, it's no longer such a strange thing, it doesn't remind them in the 1950s since they say, "Well, we're welcome, we're neighbors, I've burned something for you, and now you're smiling, and I'm going to ask you personal questions."
Offering domestic accommodations is a great way to get together.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and as a result, your face will probably be associated with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how much you're a good baker.
Badly blind spots of torment, sugar and fat will make people turn to sleep when you knock on them.
Food addiction is a typical crime in student communities.
Of course, giving someone a chicken is a cow, but it's a spell to get a taste of milk for tea?
Go to the milk owner.
He'll probably suggest you don't get tense, even if you're in anger.
If someone steals your stuff, it upsets you, and I feel you, but try to treat this adult more than my neighbor, who poured liquid into her milk to wash the dishes to avenge those who took him without asking.
She's in prison now.
You don't have to make a noise that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be like a man, but also because you're the same people from a glass house story.
The girl in my corridor asked her neighbor to add a drum and bass guitar sound, as it was 3 o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the noise.
When he finally shut up at 5:00 a.m., she kindly allowed him to sleep for two hours, and then she turned her music around and locked the door and went to a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it have been romantic if your future husband had settled in the same neighborhood as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extremely, before you bite the balls, not including, if you took the neighbor for your future wife, got involved, broke her relationship, and should you see him every day, and maybe watch him pull on his side all your friends together?
Of course, you won't show your heart - but if the hot neighbor isn't exactly your future husband, try to cool your own dust.
At that exciting moment, when you realize that someone left the keys inside their own locked room, the edge between the winch and the grass is thinner than it seems.
Good play is fun, but it turns into a contradiction for a few seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something - but never touch a room with a toothpaste and shampoo.
Behind the other door and drop the keys in a glass of water that you'll then put in a freezer--but don't attach the other things to the Blu-Tack to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: How to establish a new operating system on the iPhone after an update from Apple
A new operating system can be requested when you go to Settings, select General and then update Software.
If it's ready, the phone will allow you to jump it and fix it.
Some have encountered problems after installation when an error message appears telling them that the update of the annex has failed.
To avoid this, users are either advised to wait until recovery is stopped or to try to renew via iTunes.
Phone hints will allow you to complete the whole process.
The process may include the removal of applications to increase the free space - but Apple minimized the likelihood of this action by reducing the amount of the update and also simplified implementation with the help of a special tool that proposes to remove the applications and re-establish them after the completion of the process.
It is worth making sure that your phone is charged or is next to the charging device to prevent battery failure.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update, as the order of the phone in the process may result in the upgrade.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity by telephone.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support that Moscow provides to President Assad only led to an escalation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not going to talk to a Russian colleague, PJ Media writes.
US Secretary-General John Kerry called on Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
"The secretary of Kerry made it clear that the continued support of President Assad from Russia posed a risk of escalating and prolonging the conflict, as well as negatively affecting our common goal of combating extremism, if we also do not continue to focus on seeking ways to resolve the Syrian conflict by direct transfer of power," said the representatives of the United States Department.
They also noted that Kerry repeatedly stressed the United States' commitment to combating the Islamic State in a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member of it.
In addition, the United States “will be pleased with Russia’s constructive role in trying to oppose the Islamic State”.
On Friday, representatives of the White House said they did not know exactly what action the Russian troops were taking in Syria, but Washington was planning to discuss the matter with Moscow.
The press secretary of the White House, Josh Ernest, noted that the time for a telephone conversation between President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin had not yet come: "When the President decides that the telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, he will raise the pipe and try to make that call."
Barak Obama himself believes that the decision of Russia to increase the support of Assad ' s " playoff " regime.
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him it was a mistake that Assad's continued support would only make the situation worse.
"But he has not listened to my warnings - and the situation has deteriorated," said the President of the United States.
Imports will be exempt from customs duties.
Mineconomy is intended to temporarily release imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sport from customs duties and taxes.
The corresponding changes in the list of spare goods for temporary import were prepared by the Ministry for the Command of the Government of the FP.
This was reported by the Assistant Minister of Economic Development Elena Laškin.
In June 2015, the Prime Minister of RF Dmitri Medvedev, following a visit to Crimea, commissioned a number of departments - Minéconomour Development, Mintransa RF, Minkultura, MIDI, MHS, FSB, FTS, Rosturism - to prepare proposals to create favourable conditions for yachting in the coastal areas of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their courts abroad - approximately €200 million a year go to the punishment of European States for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
Russia ' s Ministry of Economic Affairs has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission on the amendment of the list of goods temporarily released from customs duties, taxes provided for the full exemption from customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other floating means of rest and sport.
In the Ministry ' s view, this will certainly contribute to the establishment of favourable conditions for the development of yachts in coastal areas of the country, Laškina noted.
The issue was raised by the Customs Tariff Sub-Commission, Non-Tarif Regulation, the protection measures in external trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which took place in September, and was also approved by the agencies following the discussion.
As the representative of the Ministry of Development noted, the proposed measure on full conditional exemption from imports was, in effect, a benefit.
Therefore, after the adoption of the minutes of the meeting of the Sub-Commission in the Government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with EEA member States, Laškina explained.
The list of imported goods, which are fully exempt from customs duties, taxes, includes goods necessary to promote external economic activities and international cooperation, for use in science, culture, cinematography, sport and tourism, for international assistance, etc., such as office equipment (personal computers, machine-writing machines), control equipment, storm equipment, stage costumes and decorations, moving laboratories and crafts, watermelons, pedestrian cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and objects for religious services.
In the press service, Mintrans RF “Explanations” said that binding orders had been made on the ports of Kerchi, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Eupataria, which provided for a simplified procedure for the formation and exit of small-scale, sports and leisure crafts in the port of the sea.
The mandate of the masters of the seaports of Crimea is given by the Mintrans to ensure that small-scale, sport-pare and pedestrian ships are taken to seaports and that the ships listed are taken off the seaport.
Mintrans has also prepared draft orders of the Government of the RF on the approval of the limits of the seaports of Crimea.
With regard to Yalta and Feodosia, the others are in the process of harmonization, noted in the department ' s press service.
In the opinion of Mintrans, host, classification and certification, registration of small-scale vessels used for non-commercial purposes should be carried out in the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia it was extremely difficult to navigate because of poorly developed infrastructure.
Looking south of Italy and France, this is the whole constantly developing industry, with a large number of people involved.
In fact, everything is in place in Russia.
Our coast is a small, only piece where the boats can be operated every year is the Black Sea in Sochi, Gelenjika, Novorosianska, Anapia.
But it is very difficult to see that the border service rules are extremely strict in this area: a mass of permits is needed in order for the yacht to go for a walk.
Besides, inside Russia, you're going to get hurt somewhere.
Two days she can go with her fuel, and then there's a problem where to take it, says the sales director of Nordmarine Denis Novikov.
With regard to the place of storage of yachts, there are now special anchors for yachts up to 30 m in Moscow and St. Petersburg, as well as boats for storage in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that buyers of yachts were rich, but the demand for yachts declined at the beginning of the crisis.
The World Bank has granted Ukraine $500 million in loans.
The World Bank approved a new loan project for Ukraine of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the international organization ' s press.
"The new funding will support a number of priority measures to reform the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," the communication said.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Cimiao Fanh, stated that the reform of the banking sector would help restore loans to the real economy and encourage economic recovery.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank had seen the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the serious problems, Fanh calls on the Government of Ukraine to accelerate reforms.
Earlier, the Polish Government approved a loan of €100 million in Ukraine, transferring the RIA News.
In prison, they are asked to create separate blocks for transgenders.
In October 2015, the Public Council of the Federal Service for the Enforcement of Penalties (FSIN) will discuss the possibility of establishing separate units for transgenders and transvestites in colonies.
A member of the council, Vladimir Grib, told me about this.
He believed that, depending on the total number of prisoners who had not been identified with sex in Russia, it was possible for individual chambers, blocks or even (if there were many such offenders) in domestic prisons to establish a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that the punishment of citizens in such isolated places should be determined only after the convicted have had the appropriate medical expertise to prove that the offender is indeed a person who identifies himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that the isolation of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the safety of the executions.
According to him, the proposed practice worked well abroad: the SISO (where the accused are located before the court's decision) had separate chambers for transgenders, and the correction agencies had special blocks.
Today it is the only way out of working with such criminals.
They need to be isolated, since the presence of transvestites and transgenders in normal cameras is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and the sea of problems for the staff of the FSIN.
The lowering of the transceivers is guaranteed, says Vladimir Grib.
Depending on the size of the large city, the number of criminals with an indefinite sex must and should be estimated where to distribute them.
Individuals don't really need AIDS, just cameras, blocks in prison.
Yeah, a separate colony is possible if there's a lot of transgenders.
As Grib explained, the bloc could contain 50 or 100 persons, and if a specialized corps were to be established in Russia alone, trans-sexual prisoners could be punished there from any region.
The citizen is kept in the SISO at the crime scene, so the receipt of transvestites or transgenders from other entities during the investigation and trial is unrealistic, and this is the case for those who have already been convicted in a separate column, yes, is considered by the Grib.
It was recalled that law enforcement officials had not been able to determine in which male or female investigator Dmitria Cozukova (known as Alina Davis) had been detained for drug trafficking, and that a man with a virgin was not arrested.
He was released from the house under the signature of a non-carriage.
This news has been widely discussed in social networks and media, as there is indeed no mechanism for the maintenance of transgenders in SISOs and colonies in Russia.
Russian human rights defender, activist of the LGBT movement (LGBT-Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual) Nikolai Alexeev supported the idea of creating special places to punish the transgenders, noting that, abroad, it was also possible to identify men or women in the colony, depending on their own wishes.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal was correct.
Yeah, it's a very small percentage, but there's a problem, just as there's a question of security in prisons for homosexuals, says Alexeev.
Prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be made for this and for homosexuals, more than transgenders in prisons.
However, Alexeiev has doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who are willing to give themselves over to transsexuals in order to become separate from the ordinary colonies.
Of course, medical examinations can be introduced before people are placed in a colony for transgenders, but not always the same.
For example, in the United States, one of Chelsea Manning's prisoners looked like a man, and already in prison said he wanted to change the gender," Alexeyev said.
A man can feel who he is.
But as long as there are no separate places to punish the transgenders, I doubt that prison officials will think seriously about the security of such people and make their orientation or sexual identification sound.
At the same time, an international expert on reproductive health in the territory of RF Boris Lordkypanidė noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transsexual offenders in the colony could severely delay the onset of the sentence of convictions.
The commission is created, it is a matter of sexology, long-term monitoring by psychiatrists, it is not one test on which a high-level conclusion is made.
Today's psych facilities allow that.
Therefore, and in front of gender shifts, potential patients are always going through such experiments - they show exactly whether gender shifts with surgical intervention are the necessary measure, says Lordkipanidde.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how this system can be introduced against the convicted, as the average survey takes months.
The doctor, although generally supported the idea of establishing separate blocks for transsexuals, is also doubtful that, in the current economic conditions, it would be appropriate to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical expertise, transgenders in Russia.
It is difficult to estimate that there is no official statistics, but if you take into account that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, you can say that transgenders are even smaller, and those who have such a refusal and are still committing crimes are quite small, said Lordkypanid.
Now, at the request of the administration of the Column of Homosexuals, transgenders can receive certain conditions of content.
Mikhail Antipov won a junior chess world championship.
In Hunty-Mansiske, the world chess championship was completed by 20 years of age.
The completion of the championship was more intriguing.
The winner was only determined in the last tour, and he became Russian Michael Antipov, who had yet to push the Pole Jan-Cishtof Dudou, who would certainly have gone to the title.
The girl's victory was celebrated by Ukrainian chessman Natalie Bux.
The World Chess Championship, which took place from the beginning of September in Hunti-Mansijske, had appeared to have lost almost all of its attention, since the Polish representative Jan-Kschistof Duda, who issued a series of four victories (competitions carried out by the Swiss system in 13 tours), had certainly taken the lead.
Given that Duda was a favorite award winner, yes and indeed one of the most promising young chessmen, the likelihood that he would lose his winning break seemed very small.
And even when Duda got rid of traffic and allowed the Russian Mikhail Antipov to cut back to 0.5, he remained a clear favorite in the fight for title.
For Antipo had to win the 13th round in order to catch the leader.
But it wouldn't even help you win your party, Dud.
In addition, this obligation to win could, of course, affect the Russian chess game and lead to uncompromising mistakes.
Luckily, Michael Antipov was able to avoid them.
He certainly dealt with Francesco Rambaldi, then had to wait for Duda to finish his party meeting with Benjamin Bok.
Fortunately, for Antipo's sake, the Polish shammatist fought against the Dutch destroyer.
Thus, Antipos and Duda have picked up an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipos had the best additional indicators.
It is therefore the leadership of the Hunty-Mansian Autonomous District, whose governor, Natalie Comarov, traditionally devoted great attention to the development of chess in the region, that gave the main prize.
And that's not what happened in the competitions for the girls of the intrigue.
The tournament leader - Natalie Buxe (Ukraine) - had not lost enough to win the title in the last round, which she had successfully done.
Thus, the victory of Russian Alina Bivol did not allow her to touch the Box.
The Russian sportsman remained the second with a drop from the champion in 0.5 ball.
As a result, the regional structure is changing.
The company brings the Baltic and Baltic regions together in one united Volzko-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East, to the Eastern region.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
As Michael Slobodin, director of Wempelkoma, noted, changes are being made to “remain a strong player on the market”, to develop a company “in new, not always favourable external conditions”.
In an interview with the 24th Russian TV channel, Mr. Slobodin stated that they intend to reduce the ten per cent staff in Russia.
He checked 78 Moscow's Burger King snacks and issued 367 prescriptions.
As a result, the Volokolam Shossa restaurant was penalized for 50,000 rubbings and the establishment on the Big Tuil Street was closed for 90 days, but it resumed after all the violations had been eliminated.
43 breakfasts violated the requirements for the premises.
Among other violations, inadequate sanitary and sanitary facilities, non-compliance with ventilation requirements, have been found in some establishments in the bacterium group.
The Burger King brand is owned by the Burger Russ, the owner of the chocolate network, Alexander Kolobova, who works 293 snacks in Russia.
Igor Artemiev, Head of FAS, stated that the Department opposed the indexation of 10 per cent of the freight and hosting fees, as requested by the OASR.
They initially wanted 17 per cent of the index, now they wanted 10 per cent, and even billions of budget subsidies, he said.
We're saying: That's wrong, that's too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, turn away from expensive characters, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money on the left and right.
He added that FAS had its, " much more stringent" proposals, which are now being discussed in the Government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net option with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of executing the option for shares of $300 million, the acquiring company reported.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the issue price for Sumeru and market quotations) that can be taken from a free cash flow.
Sumeru has until 3 October time to make an option or require a supplement.
The details of the negotiations in Polymetal do not reveal.
The option was included in the purchase of the Polymetal Project "Kizil" in Kazakhstan.

The second black is a more complete version of the scenario, the third is the final plan of the film.
Minpromtorg: Addressing food aid will not be a similar card in the USSR.
The Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia, Viktor Evtuv, said that the food aid programme would not be the same as the food distribution system in the USSR.
It is a modern food aid to the population and the support of an effective domestic trader.
I'm asking you not to speculate on the word "food card."
It should be noted, in particular, that the proposed product maps should not be broken down by the total deficit over time, a distribution card system where the quantity of the products received is determined.
We have so far proposed the concept, if it is approved, we will propose amendments to the legislation," says Mr. Eutuchov.
Earlier, U wrote that the food card programme for the poor had been introduced to the Government.

This year's study of the Association of Russian Managers "Top-1000 Russian Managers" is 16th time.
As a tool to assess the professional reputation of the Russian top Eschelon managers, the study has led to the results of the work of the Russian executives for a year, identifying leaders in the sectors and functional areas.
The top pool of candidates is from last year's award winners.
The winners of last year are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate for the current year's rating and to appoint members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates included in the initial list of candidates is invited to bring up to ten new managers from other companies, which would be appropriate to add to the overall pool of candidates.
The following executive managers may be deployed: financial director, commercial director, marketing director, staff director, IT director, public and corporate director, director of government relations, corporate manager.
Each proposed expert is invited by the manager to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to make his management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
Sectoral candidates are run on the basis of a sectoral classification of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forest and forestry industry, machinery, media business, metallurgicals, multi-profile holdings, professional services, communications and telecommunications, services and consumer goods production, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant is provided with a login and password to access www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information on the remaining participants and can submit their assessments on the proposed criteria for each functional direction.
The rating methodology is based on the principle "The Lighters Choose the Best": the top managers evaluate the top managers, the functional managers evaluate the functional managers.
Such a principle allows for the maximum authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the ratings were adopted at the meetings of the expert commissions.
All candidates for the current year ' s rating and multiple candidates for the previous year ' s rating are invited to the expert commissions.
The Commission is organized on a functional basis: the list of senior managers and the eight commissions for the approval of executive managers.
The expert commissions are invited to approve the lists submitted in alphabetical order (places are strictly maintained according to the internet assessment and are closed prior to publication of the rating) or to update them according to the list of reserve candidates attached.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules in the Russian language and the rules "U".
At the time of publication of the rating, possible changes in the status of managers and companies.
The comfortable rate for the investee is 10-13 per cent.
According to experts, the credit market for small and medium-sized enterprises in January-April of the current year was 40 per cent.
What do you think is the situation today?
Following the panic of the end of 2014 - early 2015, the credit levels of ISS have decreased significantly.
The reason is the sharp increase in interest rates.
No one benefited from credits below 25-30 per cent of the year.
If the bank had previously been able to raise all its potential problems in the future, from time to time, it was impossible to do so: rates and so cloudy.
For the business, the current level of ISS credit rates is uncomfortable.
For a large part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their employability.
Rates of 10-13 per cent would allow business to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive income.
How much do you think the demand for loans for entrepreneurs is met?
Following a decrease in the percentage rate of CBs, the situation improved slightly.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers have turned to loans very rarely.
First of all, business does not understand the prospects for its development and future income.
Today, business has one outcome: we need to learn to work, focusing on today's economic situation in the country and region.
It is necessary to monitor the current results more closely, to monitor the flow of money.
At the same time, with financial resources available, new technologies should be used to modernize equipment, reduce production and energy costs.
All of this, in the end, allows companies to make production more competitive and to keep business even in a unstable economic situation.
What main trends in the ICB credit market will be strengthened and affected by its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for a reduction in the average rate would largely depend on the policy of the Central Bank, and now the regulator is demonstrating consistency in the issue of a reduction in the key rate.
However, the radical fall in the price of loans for ISS is not worth waiting for.
In the current situation, inflation is a problem, primarily, which makes it necessary to raise the interest rate for real income.
In addition, the value of money in Russia will remain high even when the CB rates are reduced.
With regard to the level of delays, traditional small and medium-sized enterprises, which are limited both in the capacity to fill money and in the options for adjustment of economic behaviour, will undoubtedly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I would not expect a substantial reduction in the proportion of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the economy of the country.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That is how the word Mazda is written by Japanese ieroglyphics.
Beautiful, laconic, and at the same time, it is quite difficult for those who are accustomed to Cyrillic or Latin.
As well as the new CX-5 crossover, as well as any other brand model: an attractive outside, technically made inside.
Japan has simply been able to connect its "Japanese" to the products of the rising sun to the state of full alert.
It may be possible to argue in favour of cars from other countries, and the person will, in principle, agree with those arguments, but the whole conversation will be echoed with the final phrase: "But this is a Japanese car!
Don't argue about it!
Such people are likely to love not only technology but also other Japanese.
Citing with Basse's walk, bringing in the tobacco food, collecting catacombs and wearing their girlfriends - not in kimono, of course, but in Japanese street fashion canons: sweet, creative and very unexpected.
Please, the Japanese school form is the only form that girls enjoy and after the school is finished.
It has amazing properties: both sensitive and strict.
And than a girl older, that baby step.
The main change in the outside CX-5 is the five horizontal lines radiator grid.
But where the car changes the shape of the new image of the headlamps and the rear lamps, which the car is currently known to be in the car stream.
As before, Mazda CX-5 looks very flattering.
Siluette is harmonious, forms sensitive, but the outside is tight.
There's no need to call the police.
Under the CX-5, one of the safest in the world, only Japanese peace can be experienced.
The 2.2 l diesel engine provides a high torque in the wide range of speeds.
In this case, the fuel consumption of this engine is 175 litres of total power of 5.9 litres. The power unit is compiled exclusively by automatic transmission and full output.
Black boots, black coat, black bag...
To add a little black humour to this image, you can choose the leggins with a prince from the Not Cross police tape.
On the other hand, in Mazda, they have made the most of their efforts to ensure that you are not at the scene of your own VAT.
In order to further improve the comfort, while maintaining excellent governance, the substations have been redesigned by front and rear amortizers, as well as optimizing the shape of the front-end plugs.
The full system is adapted under Russian conditions.
The level of noise from the road and the engine at high speeds is reduced by 13%.
The bathroom in a flower or strip is as boring as the budget seat.
It's another matter if a girl grows up in a bathroom with an original drawing.
For example, from a computer game in a role-playing fighter genre.
She will then receive no less attention than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has improved the design of both front and rear seats, which provides optimal space for both wide shoulders and long legs.
Even longer, the emphasis in the front part of the central tunnel is now soft and does not beat on the lobes in the expressions.
The widest set of active safety systems for Mazda is proposed at CX-5.
Radars, lasers and cameras are used to identify potential threats.
There is both adaptive lighting, and a warning of field similarity, and monitoring of dead zones, and safe braking.
Mazda CX-5 has one of the best luggage in the class.
The comfortable, minimally speaking, is a load of 561 litres. The rear seats are composed of 4:2:4 - each section is supplied with a separate conveyor belt - and increases the baggage section to 1560 litres.
The costume of a hero multifilm in Japan is called "kigurums."
It's particularly expensive to look like a chicken peacock.
She can do anything!
Of course you should sleep.
But it's still fun for little kids.
Or just walk around like that on the street...
Because it's so cool when there's a choice of dress, behavior or car.
Thank you for helping with the preparation of the Kawaicat store.
Kiev has broken the atomic union.
Kiev formally dismissed Ukraine from cooperating with Russia on the AES Hmelnik facility.
The High Council, however, voted on Wednesday with a second attempt to break the agreement with Moscow.
Agreements for the addition of the third and fourth blocks have been signed in 2010-2012, but the project has not been successful.
On Wednesday, the Supreme Council of Ukraine passed a law disposing of the prisoner in 2010-2012 of an agreement with the RF on the construction of the third and fourth block at the AES Chmelnik.
The draft law submitted by the Government was only successful with a second vote, with 210 MPs supporting it for the first time, at a minimum of 226, but then 234 members of Parliament voted in favour of the draft.
The initial project HMELnicA was to have four 1-GWt power blocks with VWR-type reactors, but only two were able to build.
Negotiations with Moscow on accession led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement by 2010 and the Council adopted the relevant laws in 2011-2012.
As there was no funds in Ukraine ' s budget, it was assumed that building blocks would be owed by the Russian side, but no funds had been allocated.
Following the conversion to Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in relation to the two countries, Kiev began to deepen relations with Moscow in the nuclear sector, declaring its refusal to cooperate on the AEC Hmelnic and on the project of construction of the nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where relations remained remained was the acquisition of RF fuel for the current Ukrainian AES (approximately half of the electricity generation in the country), as the Ukrainian NAEC "Energoat" replaced Russian supplies with something.
The Hmelnika AES and the other contractor in Ukraine have not yet been definitively refused: negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS were announced in Kiev in 2014.
UN Gensec against the use of military force in the resolution of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Pan Ki-moon reported during the press conference that the situation in Syria could not be resolved by military means.
"There is no military solution," says AP, in response to the question of military support from Syria by Russia.
Mr. Gui Mun also reported that he would meet with the Foreign Ministers of the Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the heads of the UNSCR in the future of the month.
"There will be a meeting in Syria," he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief Genstab VS Russia Nikolai Bogdanovski reported that Genstab did not exclude the future creation of a VSB base in Syria.
There's no such plan yet.
"But everything can be," said Mr. Bogdanovski.
Earlier, U reported that the United States did not trust the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, who stated that military assistance to the official Damascus was needed to combat the forbidden terrorist group, the Islamic State, in the RF.
For details of the United States' doubts about Russia's assistance to Syria, read "U" "Russian military presence in Syria concerns Washington".
The OSCE reports on a possible meeting of the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentarians.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA) informed Arthur Gerasimov of the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in the south-east of Ukraine.
"What I know: a certain meeting is planned this year, perhaps between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," says Mr. Gerasimov.
He also called for the implementation of mine agreements and for “returning to the normal viability of our countries”.
On whether it is possible, in his view, that the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level is now possible - in "Normandian format" or in the form of a contact group at the PA OSCE - Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue had been conducted - there were mine agreements.
At the same time, policies in Kiev support all types of dialogue.
The former representative of Ukraine in the negotiations, former President Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-declared Donets and the Lugan Republic had not changed their positions in the trilateral negotiations in principle, but the tone of the dialogue had become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the Election Commission of Lower Novgorod conducted the election in the municipal district by distributing 12 parliamentary mandates on the party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of electoral violations were made by the representatives of the CRC who accused the election of “covering counterfeits”.
No comments from the opposition were received.
Together, the Russian Communist parties refused to hold a referendum on the abolition of multi-quarter house carpentry.
The city election officially presented the results of the elections in the pride of Lower Novorod in the municipal electoral district.
The total number of voters in Lower Novorode was 1.03 million, the number of ballots in the local commissions was 746.7 thousand, and the number of voters was 268 thousand.
More than 11.7 thousand ballots and 24 lost were found to be invalid.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed to political parties, depending on their votes.
According to the lists of Russia's only six seats in pride are Dmitri Sutkovsky, Dmitri Krasnov, Vasili Shupranov, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Vicheslav Rasteryev and Igor Nagorni.
The sole mandate of the LDPR was given by the leader of Vladimir Girinovski.
The two mandates of the CRC are shared between Vladimir Bulanov and the Member of the Parliament, Alexander Tarnauev.
The three mandates of "Just Russia" are given to Alexander Razmowski, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalugin.
For five days now, these candidates must determine whether they will work as deputies in the urban order: in the event of refusal of a term of office, they will go to the next candidate on the part of the party.
The Chairman of the Gorizbircoma, Alexander Maceev, informed the members of the Commission that he had introduced travel arrangements for "the transmission of Žirinovski telegrams and others" to the object of refusal of mandates.
In approving the protocol on the outcome of the elections, representatives of the CRC reported multiple violations.
A speaker with the right of a meeting vote by CRC Mr. Leonid Krasnokutski proposed not to recognize the outcome of the vote in four districts No.21-24, recalling that, under the order of the head of the Sormo district administration, the entrance to the administration building was closed, with four district commissions.
Within a long time, neither members of the House of Commons, nor candidates, nor observers, could pass, and a resonance scandal with the door of the administration was shown on the television.
At the meetings of the district commissions, all observers and members of the commissions with the right to vote had the opportunity to attend.
Their head had stopped access only when the vote had been closed and the local commissions had not yet come to deliver their ballots.
This was done to prevent various provocations.
"The head was then corrected, and interested persons could be present at all meetings," said a member of the Andreushin mountain electorate.
The Communists objected to the fact that the blocked administration building had illegally held a member of the Ludmila Aristov Congregation for more than four hours, and that a statement had been sent to the investigation committee.
The opposition also regretted that, on the day of the elections, some WIKs began to print the ballots at 6-7 a.m. and issued their ballots for the preliminary vote.
However, the members of the Committees with the right to a meeting vote and observers had not been notified, so they had arrived at the beginning of the elections on 8 a.m.
Communists are convinced that in the morning before the opening of the polling stations, the ballots could be thrown out of control.
However, the mountain, which has already considered more than 124 complaints on various occasions, says Alexander Makeev, has not found any violations of the inputs of unrecorded bulletins.
Members of the Commission and the proposal of their colleague from “Just Russia” Maria Popovov had failed to support the adoption of the amendments to the regional legislation, so as to establish a clear time frame for the opening of the pre-term ballots, which then fell into the loop.
"On your own initiative, even in the CEC," advised Mrs. Popova Alexander Makeev.
At the end of the meeting, a member of the CRC, Sergei Samohin, who called for the election to ignore dozens of complaints and to cover the falsifications of elections, broke out in the president ' s loud accusations.
"You're not here at the meeting, be more careful!" the president was offended by the election.
As a result, the protocol was approved almost unanimously.
By 27 September, the election would have to approve the general outcome of the elections, followed by the first meeting of the City Hall of the Sixth Call within three weeks.
In addition to determining the outcome of the elections, the city electoral commission rejected the Russian Communist Party in registering an initiative group to hold a local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties were going to bring two questions to the discussion of the low-towns: do they agree that multi-quadred houses should be “cut off immediately” and the rates for housing and municipal services “frozen by 2020”.
However, the lawyer of the word Irina Maslov explained that the treatment of the Communists of Russia was contrary to the law.
The FedEx output is a mixed feature, a reduction in forecasts for 2016.
The FedEx reported the uncomfortable results of the last quarter, and the delivery service giant reduced the annual income forecast due to the drop in demand for freight services and increased costs in its sub-division of land transport.
The company also stated that it plans to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx reported that he would hire 50,000 temporary workers for holidays.
Its shares amounted to approximately 2.5 per cent in the preliminary trades in 45 minutes before the opening of the stock exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that he planned to earn from $10.40 to $10.90 in the financial year ending next May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts estimated $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
A reduction in the forecast has been observed despite the rise of an average of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on 4 January, and the increase in land-use charges for heavy or bulky goods beginning in November.
The company stated that it was still planning to increase profits compared to last year by reducing costs, increasing gross income and increasing online trade.
The President and CEO Fred Smith said that the company “had worked stablely on the basis of the weak, compared to the forecast, economic conditions, especially in production and world trade”.
The work force plans for the holidays were announced on the following day after the competitor ' s statement, UPS, that they intend to hire additional 95,000 staff, about as much as they had been employed last year.
For the quarter that ended 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 per cent more than a year earlier.
The share income was $2.42, close to an average of $2.44 for the Zacks Investment Research survey of 12 analysts.
Income increased by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts questioned by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from falling into the international emergency transport sector, which has resulted in a lack of gross income growth in its express transport sub-division.
However, the purchase boom on the Internet has greatly improved the results in FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the land-use income rose by 29 per cent, but operating income remained largely unchanged due to increased costs for large shipments and self-insurance.
The Express Transfer Unit received higher income due to higher basic rates, while income in the freight sector fell due to increased wage costs.
In the preliminary auctions about an hour before the opening of the stock exchange, FedEx fell by $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, falling by 11 per cent per year and by 17 per cent below the record of 11 June.
At the most anticipated meeting of several years, the Federal Reserve System leaders will hold two days this week at a 27-foot table from the Honduras red tree, deciding not to raise the key interest rate for the first almost ten years.
At one end of the beautiful two-storey meeting room, the image of the United States will be engraved on them.
This is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve System, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues, must place the economic interests of the country above all others.
The Central Bank received a double mandate from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and to maintain stable prices here.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal System have recognized that there is also a third, unwritten order: financial stability.
And this third order may be an unknown factor in the almost projected decision, which will announce Thursday whether the US economy is ready to get rid of the unprecedented incentive provided by the almost zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most data show a confident growth in the economy, recent shocks on world financial markets can also hold the Federal System leaders cautiously from adding volatility by raising the base rate on the federal funds, even at only four percentage points.
"It is clear that the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lindsey M. Peegza, the chief economist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"At the same time, I think that if they were to seek a reason not to raise interest, the growing uncertainty around the world market would be enough to give them the excuse to wait any longer," she noted.
There is no consensus on what they are doing in the Federal Reserve System, which is causing the fluctuations of the financial market itself.
Approximately half of the economists recently surveyed in Bloomberg predicted the increase in interest rates this week.
The financial markets, however, expect the Federal system to refrain from this, while the key indicator shows only about 30 per cent of the probability of rapid recovery.
This may lead to a decline in the stock market if the Federal system raises the rate, provided that those who make decisions will not be affected by the promise that the next increase will be soon.
The Dou-Johns index, on Tuesday, rose to 228.89, or 1.4%, to 16 599.85.
Flying was driven by expectations that the federal system's strategy would be left at a rate this week, said John Lonski, the leading economist of the Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Federal System would increase the rates at this time," he noted.
If the Federal Reserve System is to do so, “they will have to go far in adopting their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so that they do not panic”.
Other experts objected that increased rates could calm down financial markets, as this would remove uncertainty about how the Federal System would operate.
A whole month ago, the Federal system seemed inclined to raise a rate of 0.25 per cent this month, making the first small step in the slow strengthening of the financial conditions, which could confirm the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expected to increase the rate this year, despite the Liberals ' complaints that there was a need for greater economic progress.
Although the emergence of new jobs slowed in August, the labour market growth was stable this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1 per cent last month, which was the lowest rate over seven years, and almost at the level that the Federal system considered full employment.
The increase in wages shows signs of acceleration.
And while inflation continues to be below the target of 2 per cent of the annual central bank, the leadership of the Federal System stated that the key cause was the temporary effect of a sharp decline in oil prices.
The economy “may also face higher rates, and needs them, given the reduction of the labour market,” noted Ian Sheferdson, chief economist Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets all over the world began to tremble at the end of last month, after China had devalued its currency.
The Dou-Johns average index for industrial companies fell by 16 per cent on record high in May, as investors were afraid that China's slowdown could slow global growth.
The market has partially restored its position this month, and the Dou-Johns index is now about 10 per cent below the high level of May.
In order to guide the Federal Reserve System, market reparation is further complicated by the uncertain calculation of the interest rate increase.
“In the absence of information about what happened in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, they would have turned their backs on this meeting,” said Steven D. Oliner, senior researcher UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Federal Reserve Officer.
Now, according to its forecasts, they will wait at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
“There is great uncertainty as to the impact on the American economy, and they have almost no reliable data after the recent developments in China,” Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not the main concern of the Federal System, and it should not be technically taken into account in the adoption of those decisions.
But essentially the Federal Reserve system has become the world financial power.
The impact of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
Only one clue from then President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve System could "smooth" its monetary expansive, caused the shocks of markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwining with one another, it could be expected that the leaders of the Federal Reserve would not only monitor developments everywhere but also consult representatives of other Central Banks and experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process - "sooner art than science" - noted Zakari Karabbell, Head of Investnet Inc - a company that is engaged in global state management strategies.
Jeffrey Laker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that “in the history of the Federal Reserve System, there were cases of an excessive reaction to the movements of the financial market that appear to be unrelated to economic principles”.
Lacer, a member with the right to vote of the influential Federal Open Market Committee, as an example, introduced decisions 1998-99.
The financial crisis in Asia has led the Federal system to lower its base rate by 0.75 per cent for three meetings, “in spite of limited identified effects for growth in the United States,” Lacer said.
The federal system leaders cancelled these reductions a year later.
The Federal Reserve System should be the first to take care of stability only in times of major crises, such as market turmoil in 2008," said Adam S. Pozen, a former member of the Bank of England interest rate committee.
The last panic didn't get close to this level, he said.
"Of course, you wouldn't want to be in a situation where you're afraid of rising rates because of the shock of the markets," said Pozen, President of the World Economic Institute for Peterson.
The Federal Reserve System Act continues to have a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I do not think they should prevent events.

Speaker Sergey Narishkin admits that the United States intends to destabilize the situation in the Middle East so that the waves of refugees can wander in Europe.
As Interfax reports, he expressed such an opinion to journalists in Ulan-Bator during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not a proponent of conspirological theories, but I ask myself: is it not Europe's ultimate goal for those who have destabilized the situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East with such maniac persistence in recent years?" he asked.
"There must have been someone who thought and knew that the flows of refugees, these unfortunate and disadvantaged people who are being saved from death are reaching out to the prosperous EU countries," he added.
Narishkan wondered: "Did many political leaders in Europe openly express the causes of this crisis, the wave of refugees, which is now literally causing their countries to collapse?"
"No, old Europe, except rarely, prefers to be silent," he noted.
In the view of Nariskin, NATO supports many European values and norms of international law.
"Europe, unfortunately, has long and impartially seen and seen how the NATO standards of military soap are being broken down, as well as moral ideals and basic principles and norms of international law," stressed the speaker.
The government forces and their loyal military forces are opposed to the rebels, mostly Islamic.

The President of Syria called the cause of an unfriendly West towards Russia.
The Western claims to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact that they are sovereign States.
That is what Syrian President Bashar Assad said in an interview with RT, First Channel, Russia 24, NTV, Russia today, TASS, Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
According to Assada, the West does not accept partners and sovereign States.
In those countries, he would like to remove one person and place another in his place, which would act in the interests of Western countries, rather than in the interests of his family, he noted.
Assad drew attention to the sharp development of Western media with the beginning of the conversion to Ukraine.
According to him, Russian President Vladimir Putin “turned from the other West to the enemy, the king, the dictator, who suppresses the Russian opposition, which came in a non-democratic way, despite his election as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West”.
Putin called on the world community to unite forces with Asada to fight against the Islamic State.
Commenting on the West ' s continuing statements that Assad himself must leave, he noted that the President came to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and, if he did, on the request of the people, rather than the United States, the United Nations Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communiqué.
"If the people want him to remain -- the president remains -- and otherwise he should leave immediately," he stressed.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and recalled that they were being co-operated with them.
Syria is also fighting terrorism with neighbouring Iraq.
Speaking of military support from Iran, the Syrian leader noted that the country supported the Syrian State in its policies, economics and military affairs.
He rejected the claim that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tegeran's supplying us with military equipment.
“Of course, there is an exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out,” he explained.
With regard to other States, we are open to cooperation with any of them, with a strong desire to fight terrorism.
"We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorism and anti-igil coalition known by the United States," Assad said.
The number of deaths was over 230 thousand, the number of refugees is 11.5 million.
Part of the territory has taken over the terrorist group, the Islamic State, which is banned in Russia.

Borodai called the U.S. newspaper a curse on the arrow.
The former president of the Government of the self-declared Donate People's Republic of Alexandria Borodai rejected the information published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said that in a telephone interview with the correspondent "Lenta.ru".
The note in Washington Post is wonderful because it's all completely messed up.
The former DNR Defence Minister Igorya Strelkova, of course, has not been bound and "extended" from the territory of the Donbass Republic in a very subordinated mood, without rope, without three fur money that is attributed to him by different characters," he noted.
According to Borodya, the story of the Arrow in conversation with the reporter of the American newspaper really went.
"Yes, I said that Strelkova was urgently required to remove the territory of the People's Republic of Donetsk," said the former head of the DNR Government.
Borodai stressed that he did not know why the correspondent of the American edition decided to write that the Arrows had been exported to the Russian territory as a “linked”.
I suspect it's a provocation.
If this is not a provocation, it is surprisingly misunderstanding, because I have stressed that the Arrows have gone alone," noted Borodai.
"It's a curse to me and to the Arrow," he said.
Earlier on the pages of The Washington Post, an article in which Borodya stated that he had taken the arrow to the Russian territory in a coercive manner.
According to the publication, Borodai noted that he had to bind his companion.
The Polish authorities began to search for a train with the gold of the Nazis.
Polish foresters started cutting trees over the underground tunnel, where they reportedly had been on a Third Reich gold train.
The work started on Tuesday, September 15th, Reuters reports.
According to military experts, it is necessary to clear the forest in order to verify the reliability of the railways.
Arms and valuable minerals may be within the train.
On 31 August, the Governor of the Polish Lower Silesian Voyage Thomas Smolarz (Tomasz Smolarz) assumed that the new evidence of the existence of a gold train was no more convincing than that of the previous.
However, the authorities decided to remove the search area.
Three days earlier, the Deputy Minister of Culture of Poland Petr Zuchovski stated that local landowners with a "probably 99 per cent" found the same train with the gold of the Third Reich, mentioned in legends.
Jukhovski noted that if the assumptions were confirmed and the values were found, they would become the property of the State penalty, while the treasures would not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two legal firms approached the authorities of the Polish city of Valbži, reporting that they had found a train in a frozen tunnel at a depth of 70 metres.
The Chief Narcotician of the RF suggested prohibiting the sale of tobacco to persons under the age of 21.
The Russian Chief Narcotician suggested that the sale of tobacco should be prohibited by age 21.
Eugene Brun noted that before that age, “love psychoactive substance — tobacco, alcohol, drugs — has been particularly harmful”.
So he said in the direct air radio station "Govorit Moscow", commenting that the speaker, Sovfeda Valentina Matvinko, supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under the age of 21.
Man grows unevenly.
You can serve in the army for 18 years, a person physically ready to do so.
He has been mentally ready for a full life in society since he was 21.
"It is known from scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry, is finally only growing by the age of 21, " - Brown noted.
Earlier, a member of the Public Chamber and head of the project "Treswa Russia" Sultan Hamzaev informed the "Experience", that Matvinko supported the initiative to increase the age of alcohol sales and "agreed with the Public Chamber to re-establish this issue in the area of the upper House of Parliament".
According to the activist, the Council of the Federation will soon set up a working group to develop a bill under the direction of Matvinko.
The Bible was requested to verify compliance with the Law on the Protection of Children
The population of Novosibirska requested the Regional Prosecutor ' s Office to check the Bible for compliance with the Federal Law on the Protection of Children from Information That Hazardous to Their Health and Development, with a statement by correspondent Sib.fm on 16 September.
The author claimed that on August 26, 2015, he obtained a Bible at the Chinese City Store in the Red Perspective, published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society.
In his book, he found fragments that, in his view, violated the FZ “Protection of children from information that is harmful to their health and development”.
On 16 September, a statement was adopted by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of Novosibirsk.
The response to the treatment of Novosibirska will take 30 days.
It's not about banning the book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, commented the complainant to Correspondent Sib.fm.
Moreover, it is a fundamental problem that will stir society.
But it will start reading the Bible, which it has not done before.
Brazilian Pediatric Union of Rio Grandes advocates healthy food for breast-feeding
The Brazilian Pediatric Organization SPRS has devised a scandalous method that aims to convince women of the need for full nutrition during breast feeding: the method implies the demonstration of images of young people who are breast-feeding, scheduled for images of harmful food.
The breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to develop a strong immune system.
Due to the high energy requirements of pregnant and pregnant women, it is recommended to increase the daily calorie rate by approximately 500 calories per day.
However, the recent study shows that one increase in calories is not the only change in the diet that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, Professor of Medical College Baylor in Texas, found that healthy feeding of pregnant women actually affects the expression of genes in children and prevents them from developing moods.
Regrettably, adverse effects of non-healthy food on the immune system of the child have been identified.
The train was parked under Hamburg by a school bus.
Near Hamburg, a train broke into a school bus that stopped on the railway road.
The 23-year-old driver, realizing that he could not move from the tracks, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute later, there was a collision in their eyes.
He was filmed by one of the schoolchildren.
An accident caused panic among students.
Some children began to cry and run along the fence.
The road is still blocked.
According to the police, no one was affected by a miracle except for one passenger who was injured easily.
Accident damage was estimated at 300 thousand euros.
Doctors call for a ban on boxing.
The guide of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) called for the ban on boxing in the country after the death of local sportsman David Browne.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died of trauma received in conjunction with the Filipino Carlo Magali.
The battle for one of the regional titles of the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the spring category up to 57.15 kg on Friday ended with the victory of Magali at the 12th round.
Brown fell into a hospital with a skull-brain.
His condition was considered critical, and he was connected to a life-saving device.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22 victories, suffered only two defeats, and one battle ended in destruction.
He's got two kids left.
This has already been the second case of the Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, a 23-year-old student named Bradon Smith died from a ring injury.
AMA now recommends not taking this type of sport, but rather, in its view, that it be banned at all.
I understand this is happening unintentionally, said Vice President Steven Pernis.
But as there is a box now, there will always be situations where a sportsman gets bleeding or brain injury, which leads to either death or serious injury.
That's why AMA thinks we can't keep living with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that brings together practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Nariskin called upon the OSCE to abolish sanctions against the RF parliamentarians.
Speaker Mr. RF Sergei Nariskin called the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians.
He said so, speaking at the session of the OSCE PA in Ulan-Bator.
We consider this to be an unacceptable act, as an approach to the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
"This should not be repeated because it is a manifestation of political insanity and a disregard for the principles of open international dialogue," said the politician.
Narishkin also called on the OSCE participants to restore the Russian and EU partnership.
Let's put morals back in politics.
Let us return dialogue and the right to international communication.
Let's put humanistic ideals back in a democratic order.
"The double never ended well," he said.
Speaking from the tribunal of the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian Parliament called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on the members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security challenges.
"First, to resolve the Ukraine crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group," Narishkin said.
He also noted the need to honour the OSCE.
"This is almost the only common area where they are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," said the politician.
It is recalled that the session of the Parliamentary Assembly was opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulan-Bator, and will extend until 18 September.
I enjoyed winning a couple of days.
A champion of peace in the light athletics of Sergey Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumphal event for a 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul Sergei Shubenkova.
He managed at his crown distance 110 meters with barriers to win at the European command championship, to establish several records, and chiefly to become a world champion, the first in the history of the national barrier print.
In addition, the sportsman recently won the final phase of the British League, taking the third place in general.
The "New News" asked Shubenkov to share the impressions of the emerging season.
Sergei, the season is not over for you yet?
Yes, I'm going to take the World Military Games that will take place in October in Korea, and then I'll think about rest.
True, getting ready now will be at home in Barnau, and being at home is a completely different situation.
It's easier than going around the world every week.
You said the autumn was a favorite time of the year for you.
The end of August, the beginning of September is a great time.
After the main start of the season, the burden of responsibility is gone.
You can compete in pleasure at the "slabone."
Plus, you know you're gonna leave soon enough...
What about fatigue?
The season is so special, it's a lot of positive emotions...
The impatience of the end of the season is always on the rise.
And it doesn't matter what he did more than win or lose.
Every competition is stress.
Permanent crossings, travels, all of this is not going to happen to the body immediately.
You get up physically and emotionally.
But now I have emotions, of course, on the rise.
What's there? I'm just happy!
By the time they finished the world championship in Beijing, do you come back often?
It's happening.
Yeah, and you journalists don't let me forget about it.
But in general, I think that the bad sportsman who lives with the old victories is running his successful races again and again.
I've enjoyed winning a few days, and I need to move on.
Was the preparation for this remarkable season very different from the usual?
I can't say that there was something special.
We got ready in December, but I missed the winter competition season.
He was first trained at the house in Barnaule, then at the meetings, and then back at the house.
It's normal.
But the coach and I were asked to try to get to a new level that I haven't been to yet.
Almost all winter time has been spent setting up a base.
They ran a bunch of cross-sections, they did exercises in a pan-physic training that included both weight and presence, and we jumped back.
Then, after taking the barrier training, a lot of technical work was done.
Did they follow up on the rivals?
I'm always trying to do this, and there's no problem in the Internet.
He saw the winter champion of Europe, and in the barricade, the whole pedestal was taken by the French!
I was thinking, there's something I need to do, get this company apart.
With each start in this season, you added and added results.
Did that give you confidence?
I've got all the last seasons on about the same schedule.
It's not like I'm running 13.20, and then it's 13.50.
I always break my shape gradually.
The main thing you wanted to do is escape for 13 seconds.
All the work was focused on this outcome.
But the paradox is that you feel like you're ready for a show, and in competitions, you're not always getting ready.
How was that, for example, at the Olympics in London?
I'm, if you're right, this semi-final run (Shubenkov couldn't get back to the final.
It was ready very well, really could have escaped in 13 seconds.
Even if he repeated his best result at that moment, he would be the bronze knight of the Game.
But it didn't happen.
Remember your first world championship?
How so?
It was in Tagu.
I really wanted to go to the finals, it was such a maximum program.
And he got away from the morning, in the preliminary run.
Then he realized that to break and wear a head fracture means not to escape anywhere.
Two years later, the world championship in Moscow was in the finals with a better time.
I remember my feelings before the decisive run: I really wanted to win the gold by then!
How do you manage to develop a similar speed, not lose your head, not turn off?
And that's the hardest thing to do.
It needs to be very accurate, technology-focused to keep the barriers from falling.
He noticed that when you're focused not on the result, but on the process, it's so much easier.
And it's the coffee you get when you feel like you're running away and it's like you're getting it all on your own!
To be honest, it's worth it.
Many of our deep - seated athletes are trying to move closer to the capital after their first serious successes.
Has there never been such a thought?
It's still better at home.
Yeah, and I don't imagine where I'm without my coach, who I need?
Maybe it would be better to have better conditions, but I'm trying to be content with what I have.
C The keys you've been together for a long time?
Since he was 12 years old, since he came into the light athletics.
Right, first I trained with his wife, who worked with the children, and then she handed me over.
I started with a sprint, and then in the long run, a triangular one.
Children's volleyball was, it's when they're shooting a ball, they're walking in the distance of the place...
At 14 he tried to run with the barriers, and I liked it.
From the very first run, the rules of the second adult level have been implemented.
That's it.
There's never been any fear of barriers?
It's been a long time since they made a deal.
But there was always a lot of work to do.
How much he was tormented by a single blast!
But there's no way out of this routine.
The technique has to be constantly flown - so that I can wake up at night, I get up right away and run through the barriers.
All those who saw your escape in Beijing claim it was a very beautiful escape.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
Usually I don't reassess my escapes, and I couldn't stay here.
But there's no scope for improvement to work on efficiency.
Don't you fear now that the victory of the year before the Olympic Games will be a heavy burden on your shoulders?
As they say, I will try to justify my expectations.
Once he chose this road, he must go to the end.
My coach likes to say, if you're not weak, no extra cargo should feel.
And I totally agree with him.
Otar Kushanashville
Well, I'm not so naive as to get an amazing response to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are mad, I understand that their bread is not fed - give it to the enemy.
And even though I wasn't wearing the flag, and I was, like, the same thing, a million times I spoke here, and I didn't call anyone directly, another thing hit me.
All my pseudo-friends drowned, and something went missing in a second.
The pressure that I'm subjected to is so strong that even I, who's a pair of guys, I think the white people are getting married.
It's like he walked himself, he walked, and you were hit by a mob, and we're going to mutate his fingers.
But I need to know, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a doll, I'm out of the hoodie, I'm old, I'm scared.
Another case is no support.
I didn't have an illusion, but now...
I've always had the best self-sufficiency, so enjoy it.
And to give passports to people like Fred Dorst or Monson, they can only be fools.
Better for me, the best journalist, the job is gone.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili briefly described Crimean events:
What they did with the Crimean Peninsula is crime.
That's what they call "anxiety."
I believe that the reference to the subjugation of the Croat has been trying to sign something, at any rate not in the general picture of human society.
It's like coming to the neighbor and taking his place...
The war from the Kremlin has gone, and it's just going to end there.
I'm almost 100% sure that, like in the summer of 2008, she started calling some asshole from the Kremlin lock.
I'm guessing who that might be...
Cobzon is not so much alive.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist, why he needs to lick Putin's hands.
He's losing his apartment?
Well, he's got a memorial.
Of course, the people remembered him as an insult to their little family.
And reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimir.
Sunrise 7 is leading in the ranking despite the Ninth attempt to highlight the losing of the leaders at Today Show
The departure of Carl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson in Canberra to highlight the consequences of the Liberal Party's declaration on the release of the leader's seat was not able to raise the rating today.
The morning of the ninth show was broadcast from the capital of the State after Malcolm Ternbull, Tony Ebbota.
Competitor Sunrise, with David Kokh and Samantha Armitage, stopped in London as part of a weekly international news series, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancún.
This torture seemed to have little meaning for Australian television operators, while the Sunrise audience had 397,000 audiences in the five largest cities compared to today's audience in 339,000.
Today has increased slightly compared to its rating on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has reduced the break-in with Sunrise in recent months.
In August today there were 318,000 compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, there was a gap between 40,000 and 50,000.
As of September, the Sunrise has 349 000 viewers against 314,000 at Today.
It's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
Winds change more than Parliament does this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thank you for your clarification.

An important news for the Seventh was the amazing debut of 800 Words with the former star series Packed to the Rafters Eric Thompson.
The new drama about the recently widowed father of the family, who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with their two children, has gathered an impressive audience of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics have debated whether Thompson could handle a popular show alone without the raptors of Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday's dinner is a huge yes response.
The X Factor of the Seventh remained in strong positions with 1,136 million audiences, easy walking The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000).
For the Seventh, success and failure on the second night of Chase Australia was compounded.
The first half (from 17:00 to 17:30) of the new television set by Andrew O'Kiffi brought together 446,000 viewers.
The second half (from 17:30 to 18:00) has moved up to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddy McGuy (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of Chase Australia brought together 520,000 spectators, and the second half was a total of 720 000.
Hot Seat collected 620,000.
The fall of Chase Australia's ratings on the second night will make the Ninth quietly admit that the Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30.
Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that couldn't play McGuy's show.

Three finalists agree that "Holostyak" Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
The secret's open?
Lana Jeffon-Fellows, Sarah McKay and Snow Markoski may have been able to figure out which one of them wins the Holocaust.
A woman with whom Sam Wood will finally stay in the Holocaust, surrounded by a veil of secrets.
And the three who came to the finish of the girl, of course, keep silent about who got his last rose.
But when we met with Sara McKay, Snow Marksky and Lana Giovanni-Fellow before the day when the three girls will have to stay two, they may have given an unexpected hint about the winner.
Sam Wood keeps silent until the very end, which will take place on Thursday.
All three women come to the lyrical mood, explaining why Wood was the ideal man, who mentioned his feelings of humor, zeal, family values, and joy as the reasons for each of them being happy to be his satellite.
But with their answers to the question, "If not for you, who should get the last rose of Wood?", they could hardly tell who really conquered the heart of the Holocaust.
Jevons-Fellows and Markoski no doubt called McKay the ideal pair for Wood.
The first day between Sarah and Sam had a good relationship.
"From the moment I joined the participants, I felt the energy (Sarah) and the energy of Sam and understood that they were very close to each other, and the whole show had no doubt about it," said Javans-Fellow.
"Sara's a very open person, easy and fun with her," said Markoski.
I've seen them together, there's really a bond between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks that she and Sam Wood will get a great pair.
Mackey himself said that she realized last week that Wood might be the same person.
"As soon as I saw him between my friends and relatives, I realized that it was not just a game -- I trusted him with all my heart," she says.
To whom should Wood be chosen, if it were not for her, she answered emphatically.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls the same way, and Snow and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor's show ends on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on the Ten Canal.

Jarrid Hayne had several options for starting a career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in moving him to the United States, as were many other clubs that sent requests after an impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Haye chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsul and it seemed to be a wise decision.
Some of the coaches would leave Hayne on the shield of the rest of the game for the loss of the ball, which the former Australian League of Regbie allowed on the first return of the pant in a winning game with Minnesota with 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his game and gave Hayne another chance to return the stick, and also activated it in the game after the trauma of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula showed up on the right side and after the game, in the split.
Instead of creating a gap between new people in the presence of the team, he got them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the press conference after the match.
The Special Rapporteur of the 49ers Club, Kim Inman, reported that Hein also received support from the special team coordinator Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and to think about the next game.
Jarred Haye lost his back-up ball with Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter.
At the start of the debut, NHL Haine and his many Australian worshipers were clearly not counting.
It was seen that Hayne was crying, leaving the field after the ball was lost, and later he told the leading show "Hamish and Andy" on the Australian radio 2DayFM 104.1, that he could not present himself with a more successful start for the NFL career.
"That's what happens, you just think about the next game and everything," said Jane.
Hen compared his career to his debut in the 2007 series of Origins, when a ball win in his starting zone led to the attempt of Queensland.
Finally, this experience proved very useful for the 27-year-old toy.
He took a picture of the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted a picture in Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Hodorkovski, the richest person in Russia, was arrested under threat of the use of weapons at the Siberian airport.

On the border of Hungary, clashes have occurred with the police.
The refugees set up protests on the border of Serbia near the Hungarian village of Riske, which had grown in conflict with law enforcement.
As a result, the Hungarian police have applied hydrogen and liquefied gas, Reuters reports.
Migrants have turned down police stones and are trying to reduce the border tax.
The clashes are aimed at strengthening, police action is being taken in response to the aggressive actions of migrants and their attempts to break the border.
As the Agency France-Presse reports, refugees were able to cross the police border, after which tens of migrants fled to the territory of Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Serbian-Hungarian border on buses heading to Belgrade and the border with Croatia, Bibi-si reports.
The country ' s authorities have allowed migrants to come to Croatian territory and ensure that they are transported from there to the country they need.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian Parliament strengthened the legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments include the participation of the army in the protection of the State, the criminal prosecution of those who illegally cross the border, and the accelerated procedure for examining asylum applications.
The Hungarian court has already recognized one migrant as guilty of an illegal crossing of the Hungarian-Serbian border and will therefore be deported and unable to return to Hungary for one year.
The Hungarian Parliament also intends to consider soon the transfer of functions to the Hungarian armed forces to protect the border of the country ' s parliament.
At the end of June, Hungary ' s authorities began to build a shelling fence of 175 km long on the border with Serbia to prevent the flow of migrants and refugees to the country.
The Russians have recognized the greatest in the U.S. history of cybercrime.
Russian Cypriot Vladimir Drinkman, the largest in U.S. history, admitted to stealing more than 160 million credit cards, Reuters reported.
During the trial in the State Court of New Jersey, Drinkman agreed to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russians spoke to three Russians and Ukrainian citizens accused of cybercrime by 15 companies.
The total damage to the accused was estimated at $300 million.
"Responsors such as Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to break our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security," said U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman.
Drinkman is in danger of 30 years of imprisonment, as well as a fine of millions of dollars.
In the case of a sentence, the court shall take into account the recognition of the rosian and may reduce the time limit.
Drinkman's verdict is announced on 15 January.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
Then another suspect, Dmitry Smiljantz, was arrested.
His last guilt in the crimes he committed was denied.
Kerry warned Lavrov about the risk, supported by Russia's Bashar Assad regime.
During a telephone conversation with the head of the Russian Middle Ages, Sergei Lavrov, U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry warned that Russia's support for Syrian President Bashar Assad exacerbated the country's conflict.
" Secretary Kerry suggested that Russia's support for President Assad would be at risk of exacerbating and increasing the conflict, as well as defeating our common goal of combating extremism if we did not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition," said a communication published on the United States Department's website.
Kerry reaffirmed the United States' commitment to combating the Islamic State group (which was banned by the Supreme Court in Russia) in a coalition of more than 60 States.
According to the Secretary-General, Assad "will never be a reliable member" of the coalition.
During the telephone conversation, Kerry also stressed that the conflict in Syria could be resolved only by political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened by isolation because of the support of the Assad regime.
Recently, the White House Press Secretary Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation if it did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed to join the international coalition, which is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
In recent times, the media have often reported the presence of Russian soldiers in the territory of Syria.
The head of the Russian IID Sergei Lavrov said that Russian soldiers had been in Syria for many years and helped the Syrians to seize the technique to apply it against the Islamics.
Four were killed when the police fired a gun with resynthetic bullets on the protest in Nepal.
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when the police started shooting with resonance bullets in a crowd protesting against the proposed new constitution of the country, as the official representative said on Wednesday.
Violence occurred on Tuesday evening in Rupandea County, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital of the country.
The District Police Chief of the Bay of Padad Dhakal reported that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered at one of the police stations, some had thrown stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal reported that the police had used tear gas, and then shot in the air before the belts were released.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is not clear why cutting bullets that are known to kill, but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such a high mortality.
This clash was the last few weeks of severe protests in southern, even part of Nepal, where representatives of the people of the Madesi state that new provinces formed under the new constitution would reduce their political influence.
Protests also took place in the west of Nepal, among the citizens of the Taru people who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, were killed in violent clashes, beginning with 10
August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into a province, which had become a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which had been centralized for several centuries.
Work on the new Constitution has been under way since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
The legislators voted for the articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said that the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Siansk plans to create a company in 900 jobs.
Siansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk area.
It was built in the 70th century as a center of the chemical industry, with developed infrastructure requiring system support.
A year ago, Zionsk led a new mayor, Oleg Borovski.
The results of the first year of work, new projects and prospects, he told the Correspondent of the Area.
Oleg Valerevich, why did you start working as a mayor?
First of all, I have been familiar with the results of the audit of financial and economic activities, initiated an independent audit of the expenditures of the local budget.
A municipal property audit was then conducted.
One of the first practical steps has been to reduce document recycling to five days.
Previously, the case papers could have been walked for months.
Income-based and cost-optimization activities have been developed.
In November last year, a Government visit was held in Sayansk, where issues of the socio-economic development of the Territory were discussed.
There was no project documentation (PSD) for any object in the city.
Without that, Zionsk could not participate in federal programmes.
We started preparing PSDs on the roads, a children's garden, a north sewer and a water supply.
Road work on two sites is now under way.
How is the order of the President of the RF on the construction of children's gardens being carried out in the city?
In July this year, 105 children were born in China.
No such positive demographics have been observed in the city for the past 27 years.
So the issue of safe places in children's gardens is one of the most relevant.
As of 1 September, the capital repairs of the Children ' s No. 10 were closed at 320 seats.
The estimated repair value is 86 million rubles.
The city has never received such funds before.
Last year after the repair, a children ' s garden No. 23 was opened, which is now visiting 200 children.
The refurbishment was made in terms of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, worth more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the Administration and the assistance of the District Government, funds for the purchase of furniture and equipment have been sought, and the National Initiatives programme has also helped.
There are plans to start the construction of a new childcare facility in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the order of children between the ages of half and three years.
We don't have a schedule for children from three to seven years.
Are investors interested in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that the construction of the city must be carried out, above all, by the Chinese enterprises, that they must be provided with work.
In October, a 60-quarter house for orphans in the Leningrad microregion is being put into service.
As far as construction is concerned, I will add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangaria, which has entered the economic housing programme.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 block sections will begin soon.
We have all declared the construction of 10,000 sq.m. of the homes of those wishing to participate in the programme very much.
One of the conditions is that the housing should not be worth 30,000 rubles per square meter, which includes the "key" section.
If we deal with the required amounts, we will continue to participate in the programme.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
In time, the Saian swine complex was built on the territory, which was sold in 2004 at no cost.
We're working with the procurator's office to counter this deal.
The more land under the object, the more federal property.
Working with Moscow, the issue of transfer of 88 g to district property, from subsequent land transfer to the municipality.
There is a potential investor who is ready to invest in reconstruction and launch the 1.5 billion rubles project.
With a pig gun, we will have 900 jobs, which will be of great support to the city.
Is the institution of social partnership developed in Sianska?
We have about 140 treaties in the socio-economic partnership.
There were no projects to be implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Efficient support is provided by companies such as East-Centre, New Zealand TEC, the Saian Broiler, the IMF PEC, and the management of these enterprises is responsive to all treatments.
Directly to the day of the OOO City, the Sayansky Broiler gave the city a children's town, the East-Center company has repaired a horse court where professionals are dealing with children with illatherapy and have lost more than 1 million rubles on it.
Through the sponsorship of the city of ZAGS, it was possible to renovate the territory of the city.
The sponsors helped to mark the day of the city in a beautiful way.
As in old times, a parade was held with the participation of urban communities and organizations.
The city’s capital, a book by the Chinese poets, was released.
The first builders and the people who have made a significant contribution to the development of the Sayanska have been awarded the medals.
Mecenat also participates in the work of the urban charity fund.
The first step was to acquire tools for young talented musicians.
Over the next nine months, more than 800 thousand rubles have been directed to support talented children, to support children in need of expensive treatment, and to support children from disadvantaged families.
How are the personnel problems in the social sphere addressed in the Sayansk area?
There's not enough doctors and educators in the city.
The provision of housing professionals is of great importance in addressing the staff issue.
Over the past year, we had five doctors ’ rooms, and we received four teachers.
We have a housing program with the possibility of privatizing it in five years.
Plans include replanning a building with eight more apartments for teachers.
Teachers and doctors are also involved in the program "The Grill for the Russian Family".
In the future, the building of a house for budget workers.
The main thing is that there is a working team in the city that I can deal with most complex issues.
It is important for all crises to make the right conclusions, and life will not stop.
The potential in China and our region is great.
The Duma introduced a draft law on the indexation of savings, taking into account price increases.
The Government introduced a bill to index social pensions on 1 February each year, taking into account price increases.
The author of the document, a member of the Fair Russia, Alexander Lomakin-Romancev, also proposes to conduct an additional pension index on 1 April if the rate of growth of the living minimum exceeds the rate of growth of prices for goods and services.
The indexation of pensions under current legislation is carried out annually on 1 April, taking into account the rate of growth of the pensioner ' s minimum living in the RF for the past year.
The draft law introduced in the lower Chamber provides for the introduction of a social pension index, taking into account the rate of growth in consumer prices.
The first index is carried out on 1 February and the second is carried out on 1 April.
The OSCE chapter stated that Mogerini was not allowed to impose sanctions against parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs, Federica Mogerini, spokesperson for the OSCE, Ilkka Canerva, stated that sanctions against legislators participating in the events of the Assembly were unacceptable.
The reporters reported this to a member of the Russian delegation at the October session of the OSCE PA in Ulan-Batore Nikolai Kovalev.
According to TASS, signatures of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece, were collected in support of the position of the Canerva.
"A strong enough support has already been formed," Kovalev said.
Earlier, he stated that the head of the OSCE had spoken with the intention of collecting the signatures of the MPs, which indicated that sanctions against parliamentarians were not allowed.
In particular, he noted Kovalev, the Canerva promised to raise this issue at the level of the European Union's governing structures and "to send the relevant petition".
NHC reports that the probability of cyclones south of the Green Island is 60 per cent
The broad low-pressure front of approximately 350 miles (560 km) south of the island of Green Island is likely to turn into a tropical cycle for the next 48 hours, reported the U.S. National Hurricane Centre on Tuesday.
Another clearly defined low-pressure area in the middle of the Green Mouse and the Small Antilles also has a 60 per cent probability of developing a tropical cyclone within the next two days, reports synoptics from Miami.
Google launches a $11 million-dollar sacrifice campaign for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the launch of a double-sacrifice campaign to collect $11 million for humanitarian organizations to assist neighbouring European countries in fleeing torn-off and depleted countries.
Google used a non-character personal approach by announcing a campaign to collect donations on its blog.
Instead of making a statement by one of the managers, Google Rita Masudou, who was running with a family from Kabul when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We went on suspicious trains and buses, endured hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has intensified, many people, such as my family, desperately need help.
The contributions will be made to four non-commercial organizations assisting refugees and migrants: “Doctors without borders”, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it would double the first $5.5 million of the donations until the amount on the google.com/refugeerelief was $11 million.
Europe is facing the strongest crisis with refugees since World War II, caused by most of the four-year civil war in Syria, resulting in more than 4 million people moving this year.
Many are also fleeing the wars of Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetes with low-fated diabetes can help with diabetes
The beneficial effect of post-inflammatory surgery in people with low-inflammatory type 2 diabetes may last at least five years, according to the new study.
However, it is still early to argue that low-fat diabetes is living longer after obesity than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"Death statistics are not at all immediately," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a nursing surgeon who wrote about a new study in the column of editor JAMA Surgery.
Pregnant surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses different methods to reduce stomach size.
They reduce hunger and limit the ability of organisms to digest food.
For several years bariatric surgery has proven its effectiveness in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but major studies have been conducted among people with morbidity with body mass index (IMT) 35 or above.
IMT, the relative weight of growth, is considered normal from 18.5 to 24.9.
IMT 25 or above says that man has excess weight and people with IMT above 30 are considered to be people with obesity.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers from the Taiwanese Min-Sheng General Hospital used the data collected since 2007, to compare two types of bariatric surgery - stomach snubbing and manic gastrectomy, with type 2 diabetes treatment in people with low obesity.
The mean value of IMT for those undergoing surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, IMT remains at approximately 29 levels for those who have received non-surgical treatment from diabetes.
Of those who underwent surgery, 36 per cent were completely cured of diabetes and 28 per cent were partially cured.
In the treatment group, the total treatment of diabetes was only 1 per cent, and the partial treatment was only about 2 per cent.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LPNP cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group”, the authors say.
Researchers also monitored levels of haemoglobin of A1s in blood that reflect blood sugar levels in dynamics.
Gemoglobin A1c is better kept below 7%, according to researchers.
Following surgery, the mean haemoglobin of A1c decreased from approximately 9 per cent to approximately 6 per cent.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, approximately 8 per cent.
But better glycaemic control rates, reflected by good levels of haemoglobin A1c, did not reduce the mortality rate in five years, according to Dr. Chi Cheng Su and his colleagues.
The study group also compared the mean results of two types of surgical treatment.
For the fifth year, compared with the group with the manual gastrectomy, the sintering group lost more weight (18.7 kg versus 14.2 kg), achieved a higher reduction in IMT (up to 7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1s (3.1% versus 2.1%) and was closer to the full remission of diabetes (46.9% versus 16.7%).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of the surgical method in part of life after five years, there is evidence of the results of a study of people with excess body mass in Sweden that surgical treatment actually leads to an increase in life expectancy, as Blackstone of the College of Medicine reported in Phoenix University of Arizona.
According to the Swedish study, the probability of dying for a period of 15 years was approximately 29 per cent lower than that of a group with more traditional methods.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that it encouraged people with ICT below 35 interested in this procedure.
“The report is very important here, as it claims that such a surgical intervention is safe in a low-IMF group where there is no increased risk of mortality or early diseases,” she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the IMT reaches the range between 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to make people take this seriously," she said.
It seems to me that as soon as they develop genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to bring it back.
There were 9 million rubles taken out of the shed house in Mithites.
In the Mites, robbers attacked the inhabitants of the sub - forest house and stole 9 million rubles and three women’s shoes.
It informs Interfax about this with a link to the IMF press service.
The incident happened on Tuesday morning.
Two unknowns through the open entrance door entered the house on the street of Goriko, tied the 20-year-old homeowner and, threatening both the knife, kidnapped 9 million rubles and three holes.
According to the preliminary data, the damage amounted to 9 million 265,000 rubles, a criminal case under the heading “Razboy”.
Europe’s fans are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 peterburg hotels have the right to accommodate tourists who will come to see the World Football Championship in 2018.
The rest of the hotel is not in a hurry to obtain the appropriate permission.
In the opinion of the experts, this is a very alarming sign.
Before the world premiere, the authorities will urgently need to think about how to disembark all the guests of the city.
The interviewers of Rosbalta believe that because of the tournament, the value of renting a pool apartment will grow by 10-30 per cent, and after the competition for a pool accommodation will have to be rebuffed.
The World Football Championship had the authorities draw attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to the law written especially under precedence, each hotel in Petersburg must pass the classification procedure and prove that the declared number of stars and level of service is consistent.
Now it is clear that this will not be done by all: the buyers are so afraid of checking that they often do not even send documents to the Federal Antitrust Office in Petersburg.
As told by UFAS head of Vadim Vladimir, the department has studied 138 men and is now planning to conduct 34 hotel cases, many of which have simply failed to respond to anti-personnel users.
There are signs that the three-ten companies' leadership has been misleading the citizen, placing some sort of number of stars in the advertisement, Vladimir noted.
The problem is that now, literally, no number can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship, the patients will take over all the peterburg hotels.
Now in the tourist city, there are 30.5 thousand numbers.
According to Small, in Petersburg, 17 five star hosts, 51 four-star hotel, 100-two-and-three-stars, 550-one-stars.
According to the First Deputy Committee on Tourism Development Nana Gviči, only 23 hotels have been classified at the moment - so many inspections have been carried out by the companies accredited in Petersburg.
And this is whether any hotel has ordered such a procedure in regional enterprises that the Small One is not aware of by surprise.
That is, there may be more than one classification, but no one knows about it.
"The last half of the hotel did not very much seek to be classified," said Ekaterin Shadski, director of the Russian Union's North-West Office.
This is due to the high season during which the buyers make the most of the money and do not want to handle other matters.
Another reason is the budgets for which no audit costs have been incurred, and the procedure may cover the hotel, depending on the status of 30 to 100 thousand rubles and more.
However, in recent times hotel managers have been revitalizing and applying for classification, Shadsky said.
The hotel has to succeed by 1 July 2016, otherwise it will not only pay the fine but will not yet be allowed to work on the world championship.
It is already known that, depending on the star, a fixed fee will be made for the hotel's number during the tournament.
The formula for calculating the value will be published next year.
This was done in order not to allow prices to rise by 200-300 per cent, as is the case, for example, during the Petersburg Economic Forum.
It is necessary to be aware and not to allow an increase of two or three times, but it is also necessary for the hotel to be able to earn.
"I think it will grow to 50%," explained the President of the Russian Hospitality Association Gennadius Lamshin.
Vadim Vladimir is, in turn, uncertain that price fixing is consistent with the market economy ' s understanding.
I don't know how much this goes into economic theory, but I hope this measure is justified.
"That's better a no-power trip," he said.
It's not clear that it's going to be with popular cheap hotels.
Members of the House introduced a bill stating that hotels should be prohibited in residential homes.
We hope that this law will not be passed or will not apply to Petersburg.
"We will resist the view that the hotels should be preserved," says Nana Gwachia.
However, she said that the miners should, in any case, be prepared to strengthen the Civil Code.
If the House still approves the bill, there will be about 80 per cent of the guests in Petersburg, and there are now 1.5 thousand numbers.
According to the President of the Federation of Restaurants and Otelers of the North-West Leonida Garbar, in Petersburg, there are no two-and-three-star soldiers who have been excavated by football patients, and there are four and five stars on the side of the hotel.
This is the situation similar to the situation where "at the 80-year-old stadium there are 75 thousand evictions."
This can be corrected as a matter of fact.
Their possible prohibition is "idiotism," "I think it's strange that some people can live in the apartments, and that's why they can't come."
If the hotel is used as a living room, I agree it's wrong.
But if the hotel that guests come to is short - term, why not?
The mini-hosts are at risk of losing the world championship for football and for their indiscriminateness.
Hundreds of small elephants simply fail to get their own classification.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will be booked.
“The companies that can carry out this procedure are not so much, so they will reject less-paid orders from the hotel and choose those who travel,” noted Gennadius Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the results of the checks that have been carried out so far are significantly higher than the peterburgs.
The cause of the Petersburg delay is related, among other things, to permanent displacements in the Government ' s tourist block, which does not contribute to a concerted work.
In the opinion of experts, if peterburgers are not enough, it is likely that they will have to pay attention to regional hotels and holiday homes.
For example, the 300-year anniversary of Petersburg in the city can mobilize a river fleet, which means guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
In addition, many patients will be prepared to arrive by night on the vehicles.
"The main thing isn't to set up so many hotels that they'll be deserted," is sure Gennadius Lamshin.
There will also be a great popularity during the football championship.
They'll probably create a pool of joint apartments in the city.
Rent rates increase by 10-30 per cent.
"From the obvious - the first to go to the house near the stadium," noted a rental specialist of the Agency for Development and Research in Larissa Bragina's real estate.
The rental price may not return to the former level after the championship, especially in sleeping areas.
This will also contribute to the construction of new transport facilities on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
It is also worth noting the human qualities of the citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar is sure that Petersburg has always been a hospitable city where people not only guide the road but can also take a mini-excursion.
There are difficulties.
In 1970 my father met a family from Murmanska, a father, mother, and two children in the court.
They found it difficult to sleep in the car with the guests.
"And Dad brought them to our communal apartment," recalled the interviewer.
True, he added that there was now no such thing in the city’s inhabitants - to call the house a horrendous effect and fear.
But in 2018, after the failed decisions of the House, would the error of the hotelers and governments have to be remembered?
The Girinov "sil" in the Amur area.
He looked with admiration at the Girinovski clown in Gosmund today.
He did such things when our generation had just learned to trade in newspapers, and still is in a beautiful form.
The topic of the statement, like, is "the LDPR protest against the outcome of the Amur elections".
Protocols do not tremble - because there are no other protocols, except those signed by the electorate, in the LDPR, according to all.
He's picking up John Abram's second place and shouting something like, "Here's the winner of the election."
And there's nothing going on in Rodney, and then, after the break with the president, he's going to lead a faction out of the meeting room, literally saying, "You're all with the fronts of your juggles and holes."
The press, of course, focuses, not on Abramov, but on the scandal and demarche of the factions as a result of this scandal and insult.
Truly, Wolfovich had a beautiful and elegant descent of the Amur region along with Abraham.
For the whole of the country, this is the regular outcome of the Žirinovski in the style of "Sondonky!" and is not a protest of the political party against the results of the concrete elections.
And the fact that the fact that the party and the Facebook page of Ivan Abramov are not recognized is a formal scandal, and the election, if you believe in the party's website, is not recognized, but the leader of the topic is clearly coming down.
It provides the dead in Amur to protect their dead themselves, and it itself blesses the "One Russia" in general and in nothing to be done by the Family.
It is a good decision not to lose a person, not to go to the present, but to show a scandal.
Another case that Abraham himself is now in a strange situation.
In addition, he was not expecting anything from the office, and there were no alternative protocols on his hands.
He was not focused on public attention, on the one hand, but on the other, for the narrow circle, it was a formal occasion and an insult to the respected champion, and, more than anything, he was aloof to the ER and the NF.
And here, of course, he has to think very seriously about what to do.
Because from the main electoral beneficiary, the policy number 2 of the region and candidate number 1 could become the only district-wide one-mandated district, which had been successfully used by its own party leadership and super-smooth leader for the same UNF and the party leadership of another.
That's right, it wouldn't be Girinovski, it should be thought about, and it should be looked after.
It's still growing and growing.
There was news that LDPR would return to the hall during the next plenary session.
I mean, the bathroom just dropped out of nothing.
Only Abram's theme was buried.
Beautiful indeed.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in refugee countries.
Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in her speech to the opening of the Dalai Lama Consistency Centre in Oxford on ethics studies at the beginning of her 10-day visit to Britain.
He stated that in the present circumstances, the interests of humanity should be higher than those of individual countries or even of continents.
He also stressed that, although this is an admiral, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not adequate.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said.
Although Dalai Lama was proud of the action taken by Germany and Austria in connection with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"The entertainment of thousands of refugees is wonderful, but at the same time you must think of long-term decisions, how to bring about the present world and the present development, mainly through education, into these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we must consider how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We need to weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Speaking of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on the actions of George Bush following the terrorist acts of 9/11, stating that the United States' harsh reaction had launched a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the problem could be resolved through non-violence.
I know that his intentions were good, but he used force, and that caused unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
4-fold increase in the number of children swallowing a hand disinfectant over the past 4 years
The toxicological centres in the United States reported an almost 400 per cent increase, starting in 2010, the number of children under 12 years of age who have been swallowing a high alcohol-containing hand disinfectant, as reported by Georgia's toxicology centre.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of Georgia's Toxicology Centre, children's cases of detonation of up to 12 years of fluids for hand disinfection reported at toxicology centres increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
“Children are more likely to contact these substances, and, unfortunately, some of them are sent to the emergency room,” said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children drink degenerative fluid especially, and some do so to impress their friends or to argue about social networks.
Youtube videos show teenagers drinking degenerative fluid as a cheap drink.
Adolescents are reported to have mixed disinfectant with alcohol-containing fluid to soften the mouth to obtain stronger drink.
Children of younger age may enjoy pleasant flavors of disinfectant fluid.
"The kid doesn't think it could hurt him," said Lopez.
Many of the most attractive (defective liquids for the hands) are those that are flavoured.
There are disinfectant fluids for the hands with scented tubers, vineyards, and oranges that are very attractive to children.
Disinfective fluids for the hands contain somewhere from 45 to 95 per cent of alcohol.
In particular, small children may experience a number of complications.
"This is the spirit of high concentration," said Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Steven Thornton, chief doctor of the toxicology center at the University of Kansas.
You wouldn't just leave a bottle of whiskey, but people keep in mind these disinfectants for the hands, and if the kids get to them, it's a quick way to use a lot of alcohol.
Najja Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed a degenerative hand-held detonator in the school, with about four sprays, was sent to treatment in the emergency room.
She had a level of alcohol in her blood of 179, twice as much as her adult, who was considered under the law to be in a state of alcohol abuse, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, a medical doctor of emergency care who had treated her at the Guinnett Medical Centre near Atlanta.
Naiga broke the word and couldn't walk when she was delivered to the emergency room.
Doctors observed her all night in a separate childhood clinic to avoid missing any signs of brain injury, because the girl fell down and hit her head, Ritchie told me.
"It was very scary," said CNN Orttoria Scott, Niaji's mother.
This could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-spiring substances or disinfectants, in addition to cleaning disinfectant fluids for children from reachable areas.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing the disinfectant containing the toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, not ethyl alcohol, which was indicated as an active substance.
In January, three fourth-class students in the north of New York agreed to poison their “anti-teacher” teacher by “dissemination of antibacterials in class”, according to the police report.
The teacher had a strong allergy to hand disinfectors, and she banned them from holding them in her class.
The police believe that the failed plan was "empty conversation" and addressed the discipline of the school district.
As the oldest children’s library in Barnaule became a family club.
At the back of the scan at the entrance to the end of the children's library, the N.K. Kruppsky is a cuckoo owl.
The kids who follow the books are trying to feed her.
Several generations have been walking in this library for 95 years.
The very first readers of the 20th century had used the loud readings here, placed shows on Maykovsky’s texts, held literary books, and copied with Lenin’s wife.
The census continued for four years, and as reported in 1939 by the newspaper Uni Stalinec, with every day the "friendship between Hope of Constantinople Krup and friends of the Barnaul Children's Library" became ever stronger.
Hope Constantinople even sent her childish photograph to distant Barnaul friends one day.
And when the barnacles asked if Hope Constantinople objected to the library's name, she wrote no, no, no.
The letters are long washed in the museum, and the grandchildren and lawyers of the first readers have to explain the hard profile of the barbershop in the library building.
During the years of the adjustment, people often called, and they became upset: Why is the children’s library not renamed?
Let's have the library name of some good child writer without a political spell!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it was.
"Crupt" is, please, the most famous and popular library in Barnaule, as a "line" in Moscow.
On the field in the library weaving, a yellow - brick road.
"Vollector of the Deadly City" is the favorite theme of the artist Olli Moscow.
In the past, Ola was a manager in a legal company, had come to work in eight, had gone to five, and all the other managers had been distinguished only by love of painting.
And then she found an Internet announcement: "Illustrator is needed for the book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and she was called "My Cancer Mommy" -- "In my mom's cancer."
Oil made an illustration, and thought, "Life can end at any time, and there will be no miracles in it unless you create them yourself."
Now she works in the library, she paints the children’s books of writers around the world, and she makes stories herself.
Traditionally, children are losing interest in the book, that they are increasingly living in some virtual space...
But we have kids reading, and their parents understand the importance of reading, says the director of Tatian Kuschvid's Russian Planet.
In recent years, we've even had a moment of confidence that a children's library is needed, and she's going to live -- kids are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
In the library, the library has a large exhibition with an updated photo exhibition.
New photos of readers who go to the entire family library — Mom, Dad, and the children — are featured in the neighborhood.
The library boasts that the popes have become increasingly popular with the children.
If a two - year - old child has read all of Chukovsky’s, he needs more books at an older age.
But now there is a law that prohibits an eight-year-old internkind from issuing books of category 12+.
To obtain such a book, a child must bring his parents with him, they come back, and gradually "Krupski" becomes a sort of family club for them.
In the library there are treasures - a pre-revolutionary collection of caves and eras, to bring the Queen in the annex to the magazine "Niva", an annex to "Murzylki" for 1936.
Now we are not just the conceptual space of the temple of books, we are now open to movement, we are trying to become a special place: not home, not work, not school, - explains Tatiana Kuschvid.
We can come all together to read, play, paint.
We've made a play area for the kid. The kid just comes to play, and the arm still hangs on to the book!
Some of our readers have their parents, and they support their feet, and they don't want to leave.
Moms often come with wheels - and we are pleased that they put the library first among all the other places where children should come.
Tatiana Kuschvid says: Modern children like us once loved classical children's literature:
"The publishing process is now developing, and much attention is being paid to the authors who are the linkage between generations."
And if you're talking about little kids, it's important for them to be a hero who travels from one book to another.
Children don't like to be alone with their heroes.
The library regularly publishes booklets for parents, telling them what is happening in the modern literature of children, which books should be considered and why.
The booklets are so interesting and interesting that adults are interested, but this library is not for them at all.
It is forbidden for adults to produce books outside the reading room.
This magical privilege has only children.
...In the next room the library has a square hole from the old wooden ladder in the basement, in the library.
Steps will slip under your steps - it's a very old time machine.
You meet with your childhood book like an old friend: Hi, it's good that you and I don't change.
Ellie is still jolly walking along the road made by a yellow bear, the Tola Rižikov belt is stealing magic spears, and Malchis Kibalchis did not say so to the cursed castles of the Military Secret, which he already has a strong word.
Such books, like passwords, can be found anywhere.
It is in the warehouse and the current book series - for example, the pre-revolution book was filled with caves and eras.
Or take the Queen in a famous annex to the magazine "Niva".
Or "Murzylky" for 1936.
It was time for the pages to be old enough to be decorated with tea.
These publications are no longer published to readers.
It's the stories of our future collection, and I'm dreaming I'm going to retire, and I'm going to have a few children's books.
But the kids are not going to do it, and the old books aren't very bright, and the themes... you open the first page, and there's Lenin, the party, the comsomole.
Now it seems like why did we all write this "Pioner Truth"?
But it was interesting anyway, says Galina Ilasova, a Russian planet, a bookstore.
The Mursilki's pages have been faded out of time.
Galina Vasilievna spends her whole life in the bookstore.
She knows what kind of bouratino doll color the year Harry Potter became the captain of Griffindor's team at the Quaddie Championship, where Carlson uses a motorbike, and who works for Alice Selesney's father.
The librarians pay little for their work, and those who can live without these book series quickly find another profession.
Only the most convinced are the educators, the teachers, the ministers of the book cult.
They can also be found smiling - it's thought to be a professional drawing of a children's library.
If he smiles at you in the first minute of the conversation, he's a professional.
I love children's books as much as I like to be a librarian, to be fair and beautiful, and I still love to read them, says Galina Vasilievna.
I read everything: military, historical behaviors, stories, fantasy.
Reading modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think in my childhood everything was different.
The books were the most interesting and fascinating of all that happened to me at the time.
And since I was foolishly fond of them, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be, despite the riders.
And I'm happy when our ex-readers bring children, and the grandchildren...
Listening: There's no difference in Celtique.
Griffiths rejected the debate on the differences in Celtic after Dale's admission that Hopes was in a bad position, but he'll fix it.
Harts will protest the Scottish Football Association's claim to Nelson, and Worberton is afraid of signing contracts in January that might violate the team's unity.
Dons have increased the advantage over Seltic to five points.
The Adam Runi Penalties in the first time gave Aberdina a little advantage over the Hamilton in Pittodrey, allowing Dons to get rid of Celtic for five points.
Griffits rejected the debate on disputes
This led to a hearing of the controversy in Zeltika, which was cut off by Griffiths, claiming that he and his team members were not suffering from any increased criticism of the Dutch League leaders.
I don't think we're feeling the tension, I think the players are looking for him.
The Dutch are bored because the Scottish are not fighting for the title - de Bur
The former Rangers semi-defencer and former member of the Dutch Assembly Ronald de Bur said that Dutch football patients lost interest in Celtic because they did not meet with Rangers.
De Bur, currently a representative of Ajaxa, said: "In the Netherlands, the most attractive moments of the Celtic game are no longer shown, and why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here are not just talking about the Rangers return.
They're talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
In the old firm's games, there's a lot of tension, and not only do people in Scotland want to see these games.
"I'm changing everything," said Dale.
Ronnie Dale admitted that "Seltic" is experiencing difficulties, but the Norwegian coach swore to change everything.
As a result of the defeat of Malmé and as a result, the League of Champions soon followed 10 Aberdina footballers, who are now on top of the table with five points.
However, Dale said, "There were bad times in "Selite" before, and we're going out again."
Now we want to get out of this as quickly as possible.
I understand it's very boring, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's happening.
We are, too, but we must continue.
And we really really need Seltica's support, because this game is getting a lot better.
It's so important to stay together now.
Worberton is looking forward to January transfers
Despite the views expressed a few weeks ago that he had identified some of the goals of the January transfers, the Rangers boss Mark Worberton was unfaithful to the January campaign, claiming that he did not want to destroy the unity of the team.
The former attacker, Brentford, said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the season starts to adapt, which you have seen in our own group in the season.
The team is working really well.
Sometimes more harm comes from adding unnecessary toys to what you really need.
Mitch, who is interested in Seltik, decided to finish his career.
The attacker Sonsy Mitch, who was connected to Seltik during the transfer window, decided that he could leave football after his contract with the Lebedes ended.
The 29-year-old has had trouble with the lodger for two years, and he couldn't leave Wales this summer.
Harts is going to oppose the SFA on Nelson's statements.
"Harts" said in account 2:1 when they removed Patterson, and they became playing 3:2, but the red card of the defender was cancelled later; it was the third red card of Colum, cancelled eight months later.
Nelson did not give up his words by saying, "I did not question the ethics, I did not comment on the game."
Griffiths swore to avoid Tinkasl
The Heibernian team's direct play was given an excuse after he admitted that he sang a song with insults about the former Harts player Rudy Scarcell.
The incident occurred in the pub in Roseburn area in Edinburgh before the beginning of the Edinburgh Derby at Tinkasle in March 2014.
"It was the derby, and it was the burner," said the attacker, adding, "I can't be sure I wasn't going back to Tinkasl if he wasn't playing for Seltic.
Donnellly: Tannadis's advice is trusted in Dandi United's management.
Simon Donnelly argues that the Board of Directors of Dandi United is still confident that the management team will change the situation better, but agrees that the deterioration in the field should end.
I think Steven Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the guys ready to go out again," said Donelli.
Mackinnes is glad he won the "unprecedented" in Hamilton.
Derek McKinness admitted that his team "Aberdin" had had to fight desperately against "Hamilton Assisi" to win the seventh victory in the lead of the League, which put them in five points above "Seltika", on top of the tournament table, thanks to Adam Runi's first-time penance.
McInness said, "There's no team here that would win anything -- a dove, or a league champion who didn't win meetings like that."
The level of unemployment among the Scottish people does not change, as in the United Kingdom it generally grows
BEZABOTIA remained in Scotland for 164,000 people between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the United Kingdom increased from 10,000 to 1.82 million for the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was higher in the United Kingdom at 5.5 per cent, as shown by the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, with the number of workers now 2 612 000.
The employment rate for Scotland was down to 74.0%, which is above the average of 73.5% for the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Minister for Affairs David Mandelle, commenting on the latest figures, noted: “The long-term plan of the Government has laid the foundations for strengthening the economy”.
It was almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
Over the 12 months, we have seen further improvements in Scotland's labour market in terms of employment growth and unemployment reduction.
Why am I a witness to the death penalty in Oklahoma?
Today, by avoiding legal interference at a later stage, I will see how human punishment is being punished.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting on a visual gallery of the death squads in Oklahoma State Prison when Richard Glossip will be punished with a lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four official witnesses of his death.
For the first time, this request was made in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew near, I became afraid.
So why would you do that?
I agreed, because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed story of the death penalty.
That would suggest a unique feature.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend the US executions, and since they want more often than places, the results of the dark lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press posts was reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever's chosen, he'll look at it with no emotion.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and we've had our own relationship with him after a few months of phone calls and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I cannot be both a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a handbook to record what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me of being impartial on Twitter.
It's a lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he likes it.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she could “make better” herself, but she still felt that I was wrong about what I was doing.
Richard Glossip didn't agree with any of what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it, even if he said it.
I told him he could get me out of his witness list at any time.
But he wants the journalist to be present there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that transparency will help to eliminate the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, Haffington Post reporter, will be with me.
If you want to know more about it, listen to the podcasts I wrote.
I'm not going to be here in detail again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip wasn't guilty.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treize make him guilty of crime.
But I believe there's a great chance that he's not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that the death sentence was not enough.
I think his punishment is wrong.
And I'm going to see him die from this.
I can't claim to be completely objective.
There will also be other reporters to whom you can refer.
From me, you'll know what it's like to see a person I like die without need.
The persecuted human police ordered to leave the Kanning River
Constable from the town of Canning-Weil was able to arrange for a man to leave the Canning River and remain dry.
Perta's residence was about to leave the police, but he didn't dare to stop in the dirty water at the mall in a few metres from the police officer trying to "make it easy to get out of the beach."
The Kanning-Weil police were called on Tuesday for illegal entry into a foreign territory in Buckingham.
When the police noticed the suspect, he tried to get away from them by moving to Kanning.
But he didn't get away.
"He stood in the water and said, "I won't go out, let's go, catch me," said Senior Sergeant Chandelle Kasldain.
Constable Laclan Perhavec didn't really want to wash the shape, so he used a safer reception -- "a conversation with a good cop."
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape," says Senior Sergeant Kasldain.
The football champion Ben Casinos remembers that.
In 2006, Casinos went to the province to avoid meetings with a police patrol to check on alcohol and tried to cross the Suon.
His efforts were futile, but encouraged locals to invent a funny "Biathlon of Ben Casinos".
Peter Modi accuses the stewards of trying to spy and threatens to get out of horse sports.
Peter Modi accused the drivers of Racing Victoria of trying to put a spy in his horse's lap last year and threatened to leave the horse's sport immediately.
Its aim was to become the drivers and ethics officers of Racing Victoria, whom he accused of having organized a campaign against him personally, and to withdraw from the start of Lady Tatai because of a violation of the drug regulations on the day of the launch, on Wednesday, it became the last straw.
Modi reported to Fairfax Media that he always applied all the efforts in jumping, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result of the Kobalt Leader's test, which he could not explain.
He kept his tongue on the suspicion of spying for half a year and did not want it to "seem like a green vineyard."
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I've been for a long time, but sometimes it's getting you out of the way that you don't stop," Mudi said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to sleep tight.
I want to walk with my head up high, and I want my owners to know - I'm doing everything for them.
When they start to think it's not, then I'm gonna have to stop being a coach.
Then I have to think about what to do with my license.
Mudi earlier made a sensational statement during his interview at racing.com that the ethics department was trying to spy on his horsemanship.
"A year ago Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart lived in a room with a man I'll call, if they ask, and offered him a job in my convoy to share information about what I'm doing in my convoy," Modi said at Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a liar.
If so, they should all make statements, as they failed to understand me.
Robert Rollston, former president of RVL, David Mudi, current president of RVL, and Bernard Sandri, current executive director of RVL, have been aware of this at all times and are now aware of it.
Shouldn't that make me think it's getting personal?
Should not the RVL be bold and respond to what is happening in this business, other people besides coaches?
Am I worse for this profession?
Is that how I feel about this profession?
Maybe people there think it's true.
Maybe they should get me a license and push me out, and I don't doubt what I'm saying right now can make them think about it.
But I got to the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
I'm really sorry about that.
I will put pressure on them, and I will be responsible for their decision-making.
I have family support, and I can leave.
The coach only grew up during a long investigation with a cobalt and a leader, and the last removal of the horse from the start made him say he could "put his license on the table".
Modi, the most well-known of the fact that he had prepared the invincible Black Caviar champion, called for medical preparations to be applied on the day of the “smiley” competition after the horse’s legs were pressed from the clay, which was a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the rules on jumps.
"I must bear full responsibility for it," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put her down.
She could've gotten a compression last night.
She could've gotten it yesterday, just like it was.
She was with him the day he ran.
Modi may be disqualified for three months in accordance with the regulations on the use of medical medications on the day of the compression competition, as to which the squads have opened the investigation.
It's anecdotes.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but that's too far," Mudi said.
A driver who has taken a train and has been hidden from the scene in Kobrama, arrested
The police arrested a man who had hit a motorcyclist in Kobra and hid himself from the scene.
Motorcyclists took him to a helicopter at Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car at Murrey Welly Hayway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of Natalie surrendered to the police in Sheppartone.
It is expected that he will be charged with leaving the scene of the accident, with no assistance, and with other traffic regulations.
A motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Kobrama, remains in a stable hospital.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellami charges rivals in the use of hard force.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellami called the criticism of the takeover of his team as "adjournment of the agenda" by two favorites of the NRL champion.
Coach Sidney Rusters Trent Robinson said the judges allowed Storm to "fight" with his team during a sudden Storm victory at the end of a qualifying game in Sydney on Friday evening.
Coach Brisbane Broncos, Wayne Bennet, made a clear slot on Storm after his team won the final qualifying tournament at Nosern Queensland Kauboz on Saturday night, when he called this game "typical" for the team of the regiments and said that two of the Queensland teams were not "too successful" in a hand-held grip.
Bellami protected the capture of the ball by his team and said that they were just focused on "contacts", taking the ball.
Bellami added that he was convinced that his team had been criticised by two leading coaches, as that meant that they were concerned about possible damage to Storm.
"This continues to fade - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about the harsh receptions when they played us with the 24nd account," Bellami said on Wednesday.
I can tell you that we haven't changed anything in our systems or protection techniques all year long, just in the last six weeks, we've been paying special attention to the contact with the ball, which has become a turning point for us.
The trend has been there for three years and he's obviously training a great team, so he's probably not used to playing, and it's been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how it always turns out this time of year.
Bellami argued with Bennett's idea of an impressive football, reminding his teacher that "St. George-Illavar Dregons" Bennett won the 2010 championship, showing a "hard" football.
Wayne's talking about winning football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night, and to see how impressive their game was," Bellami noted.
I remember that in 2010 St. George was hardly critical, calling a boring team, and Wayne said it would never bother him.
But now he has a team that can show what he thinks is impressive football, especially his young half-guards at their speed.
It's a football you'd like to play when you have such games.
He made this comment in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style -- not every team has two half-guards like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like that.
This gives me more confidence because they're saying these things because they're a little worried about us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they got to big games.
Bellami also noted that the Storm and Rusters game was a match with a large number of points than the Broncos and the Caboys game.
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game he was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and what, is that impressive football?
Or to view as impressive interruptions and unsuccessful attempts?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, that means that at some point we can meet them there.
At Storm at the end of this weekend, as they won the right to take either North Queensland Caboys or the Crown Sharks on the next Saturday evening at the preliminary final at the AAMI Park stadium, tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
Indicted in the possession of drugs, Serbs are released at $20,000
A man who was threatened by a life sentence for attempting to allocate 40 kg of cocaine delivered to Queensland by smuggling had been released for $20,000.
Marco Maximovic, 29 years old, was one of five people arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on the island of Solay, which traveled from South America through Vanuatu and landed in Kumer in August.
During the whole morning, Maximovic and his associates saw them at the docks, and later he met them at Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kg of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Although Maximovicu threatens the lifetime of an attempt to allocate drugs to a quantity sufficient for sale, his lawyer, Maximovica, claims that there is no evidence that the last attempt was made to get the whole party, and that the man could be in coffee without any intention.
The Supreme Court judge Peter Flenagan doubted that Maximovic should have been released.
The latter has relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
The mother and stepfather Maximovic was invited to make a joint deposit of $200,000 for his release.
"The two evidence makes it clear that the amount of $200,000 is too large a financial burden for them," noted Judge Flenagan.
But one such measure was not sufficient as a guarantee that it would not disappear, the judge added.
Maximichu was allowed to be released on bail, provided that he would deliver his Australian and Serbian passport, be observed in the police daily, and observe the ordering hour from 6 to 6 a.m. to 6 a.m.
Fotois Caccicaris: "I am proud of the gathering of Greece, which has been fought in the last few seconds."
The main coach of the Greek assembly Fotis Cacicaris paid tribute to his team after the match 1/4 final Eurobasket-2015 with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game has made some mistakes.
It was a big game, quoted by the AFP Cacicaris.
We've been preparing for a great Spanish game.
Efforts have been made to combat, but the defence errors have determined the fate of the meetings.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my kids.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: "I'm going to be assigned to the CSCA's functions."
CSC Newsman Joel Freeland said he didn't believe in the curse of the army.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to break down the negative trend and finally win the Euroliga next season.
I spoke to Coach Dimitris Itudes several times this summer, and myself, after I joined the team, I quote "R-Sport" Friland.
Yeah, I'm gonna need some time to move to the center position, but in the NBA, I played more foreward.
Now you'll have to stand up to a big central rival, but I've done this before, so I think, and I'll be able to do it now.
The army last won Euroliga in 2008.
Since then, they've been going to Final Four six times, but they couldn't always show their best basketball.
It's the opinion that the team was wrong.
In this whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's difficult, I understand all the disappointments of the club and its patients.
But we have a great team now, and if we're going to show the best we can do, we have a good chance of winning Eurolycus, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, the Moscows have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be CSCA year.
As for consent, I am not a superstitious person, and I do not believe in any curse.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, it's possible.
I don't have any rituals in front of me, I'm just listening to music and trying to relax as much as possible.
Louis Enrique: "To me, a match with "Rome" will be special."
The chief coach of Barcelona, Luis Enrique, did not hide that he went back to Rome on the 1st round of the team tournament of the League of Champions with Rome with special feelings.
According to the teacher, the visual unity of his current and former team would be far from consistent.
It is recalled that Luis Enrique trained wolves in 2011/12, but he was unable to show up on the best side in the capital of Italy.
I returned to Rome a few years later, for which I have gained some experience. - The official website of the UEFA of Luis Enrique.
I have very warm memories of Rome.
It's gonna be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The main thing is to start champions in the League of Wins.
The August meeting in Cuba does not affect the actions of the teams in the next match.
I'm looking forward to the Roma game she showed in series A against Juventus.
It's a strong team that can press and know what to do with the ball.
Vadim Scripchenko: "Craznodar" has various options for attacking."
The Acting Chief Coach Ural Vadim Scripchenko in front of the 9th Tour of the League of Prime Ministers with Krasnodar noted the variety of attacks against the rival's team.
According to the teacher, “bigs” have several models of the game in their arsenal in the attack.
The unit will be held on 21 September and will start at 16.30 in Moscow time.
As we play with Krasnodar, let's see, the official website of the Urala word Scripchenko.
We've got a week ahead of us.
This team has different options for attacking, it's doing a lot of attacks, and we're not slow, so I think it's going to be a very interesting game.
In the forefront of this game, given that Krasnodar is the winner of the League of Europe against Dortmund, we are trying very well to prepare for victory.
Roher Canyens: "The House of Astana" can pick the eyes of anyone.
Astana's defender, Roher Kanyas, after winning the 1st round of the team tournament of the League of Champions with Benfia (0:2) expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team's game in the future.
The Habbek thinks that the astutes can pick their eyes from any rival in their field.
Despite the fact that the match has been difficult for us, I can say that we played well, the official website of the UEFA word Kaniyas gives us a little bit of courage in the attack.
Benfia's top-class, but in a home match, I think we can count on them to pick their eyes.
That's quite real.
But first we need to think about Galatasarae and then about Atlético.
At home, we can pick eyes for anyone.
Raphael Benez: "The second time ever: Kristian Ronald is the best in the world."
The chief coach of Reaal Rafael Benez expressed satisfaction with the great victory in the 1st round of the team tournament of the League of Champions with Shatter (4:0).
The specialist gave credit to Christopher Ronald, who was the author of three heads.
The match was uncomplicated, because "Shatter" has the ability to control the ball, says the official website of the UEFA word "Benetz".
The rival had few moments, but their contractions always kept the danger.
I'm not gonna say that Real played perfect, but we had a lot of brains.
I'm glad we didn't miss the ball and we killed four.
Christian Ronald confirmed his level.
It's the best game in the world, I'll repeat it as often as I like.
Yordi Alba: "Christian Ronald can't be compared to Messie."
The protector of Barcelona, Gordie Alba, believes that no one can compare with his associate Lionel Messie.
According to Spanish, the Forvard Reala cannot do that either.
Messies on the top five, quoted by Le Figaro Albu.
Even Christian Ronald.
Leo in the field is changing, I can't compare it to anyone.
Daniele De Rossy: Barcelona has not only a unique style but also a bright individuality.
Half Protector of Rome Daniele De Rossy, a team tournament champion of the League of Champions with Barcelona, pointed out the importance of compactity and insurance in the game with such a strong rival.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, beginning at 21.45 a.m. in Moscow.
Remember, the SE will carry out its textual transmission.
"Barcelona" is a special rival, a good team of great players, quoted by the official website of UEFA de Rossi.
It's hard to play with the blues, because they have not only a unique style, but also a bright individuality.
To let them go, we'll have to smoke all the time, and we'll have to take care of each other.
Missions are almost always successful when they go in the circuit, so we need to maintain compactity and organization.
The food is expected to go to the beginning of the SCA in a match with the Slovenian.
HOLKIPER ILIA JEZOV stressed that he hoped to join the army in the next match, the KHL champion.
The food went to ice instead of Mikko Koskinen at the 23rd minute at 0:3 and reflected all the booklets on his doors, the fourth goal of SCA missed after replacing the door with the sixth field player.
The next team will march against Slovenia.
I hope that I'll go out in the next match at the start, says "R-Sport."
I'm not an expert at the door, I'm a doorman, I'm not showing us the missing heads again, so it's hard to track.
"Dinamo" played well, everyone has bad matches.
The team's still lost.
I'd better miss a bigger one, but I won the team.
Shafarjov has fallen into a virus infection hospital.
Luci Shafaržova is hospitalized with a bacterial infection, reports AFP.
To date, a Czech tennis player is in a clinic in Brno.
The deadlines for the restoration of the finalist Roland Garros-2015 are not yet known.
It is also recalled that on Monday, Shafarjev has climbed up one line in the WTA rating and is now the fifth missile of the world.
Steven Hogg used the girl's phone to force the pedophiles to send photos.
Pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of violence against children.
Steven Hogg picked up the girl's phone while she was sleeping, registered to the Internet message service, where he received a number of inappropriate images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found a phone gap and found it in Hogg's sleeper's hand.
She checked it out and found shocking pictures, and then she immediately drew her mother's attention to it.
The police came and saw five images, then examined the computers found at the address, and found the “relevant” requests in the search system using words to detect improper images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he did it because it could "draw the paedophiles", and then he would "bet he's a cop to scare them."
The Chief Justice Elid Robertson told the sheriff's court in Dandi: "He said it was a passion, he was afraid to scare people.
He admitted that he had made requests on his computer, but he said that it was because he wanted to become a police officer to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversation with an unknown person who had sent images to him and that he had requested more photos to be sent.
He said he did it to deceive them.
He said he had a problem with his head when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added, "When the girl found pictures on the phone, she called her mother, she would cry and she would cry.
She saw inappropriate images on the phone, and the accused was then given a visual rate.
The girl was interrogated and reported that the accused had used the computer and the Plasterishn to talk to the girls who looked very young.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road in Dandi, confessed to the charges brought in the manufacture of childless photographs on 14 June last year, in violation of the conditions of deposit of 25 January of this year and not in court on 24 March of this year.
Advocate Gregor Sim applied not to bring Hogga into the list of persons guilty of sexual offences, as there could be evidence that there was no "significant sexual element" in this crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmicle postponed the sentence until October until a report from the social services was received.
Hogg was released on appeal in this case, but he was detained before hearings on other cases.
It was listed as having committed sexual offences until the date of the sentence.
President Robert Mugabe is not reading that speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the senior government leader of Africa, fell off a ladder leading from the podium earlier this year.
He didn't get hurt, but the video with the fall scene was currently distributed on social networks.
The opening of Parliament was also obscured by statements by the opposition Parliament that they had received anonymous threats warning them of Mugabe ' s education at the time of the treatment.
Months ago, they raised the President at the time of his address to the nation in Parliament; that is what Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
A member of Parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change, Innocent Gonez, said that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones to prevent Mugabe from interrupting.
“The message came from a number that is not reflected, but it is titled Death,” he told reporters at the end of Mugabe’s speech.
Noted members of Parliament warned that integrity was ending in the Parliament's building, and as soon as they left, parliamentary integrity did not work.
A member of Parliament said that the party headed by Morgan Cwangarai was “anxious” about its policies.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard intends to reduce from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs under its programme of restructuring and reduction in service costs.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard is divided into two companies registered in stock exchanges, separating the production of computers and printers from the faster development of hardware and service operations.
As a result of the projected reduction in jobs, approximately US$ 2.7 billion, from the fourth quarter, is reported in Hewlett-Packard ' s statement.
"This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Witman, Chairman and Director General Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more focused than Hewlett-Packard is currently, and the portfolio of business will be wider and deeper that will help the company move to a new business style," Witman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our clients around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual salary of over US$ 50 billion and will focus on providing previously unaccompanied integrated technology solutions, reports the company's statement.
This is how the company, founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Heulette and Dave Packard, is divided into electrical equipment; their garage in Palo-Alto was named "the birthplace of the Kremney Valley".
Hewlett Packard is in a process of large restructuring to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This is the second step in the world of personal computer manufacturers and one of the largest US technical companies, the latest developments in this sector, based on the confidence that specialized companies are working better.
Captain Arsenal Mikel Arteta says his allies must support traumatized Jack Wilshire before playing with Dinham Zagreb.
In his discussion with Wilshire Wenger, he also stressed that only September was yet, and that, provided that the restoration of Wilshire was planned, nothing would prevent him from returning to Christmas.
In the most favourable development of Wilshire events, at least four of the following games will be missed in England and its participation in the European Championship will remain under discussion the following summer.
Most of all, this recent problem is that Wilshire has certainly ended the previous season with the only trauma of the lobe and is going back to the usual aggressive style of the game during pre-season training.
Wenger: "This trauma does not threaten his career."
It's just not a living bone.
It's nothing serious.
It's just a coincidence.
This is not related to the lobes or traumas that have occurred before.
This may be medically related, but, as Wenger has also permitted, there is a risk of additional injuries to any player returning to the middle of the season.
There is also a negative trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has 23 different injuries that occurred to him in six years after his debut.
He also played only 65 of the 157 Arsenal games in the league in the last five seasons.
If you look at the Arsenal schedule wider, you can see that in six of the eight seasons, starting from 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two Premier League clubs, which account for the most missed due to day trauma.
Wenger recognizes the likelihood of aggravation in the vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that the improvement of trauma statistics in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes after the trauma, you'll be vulnerable for some time -- at that time you need to regain your strength and gain a competitive advantage," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to do it.
I hope he'll recover physically, and I'm sure his career will be the one he deserves.
Arsenal launches a team of champions in the League of Champions in the middle of the Dynamo-Zagreb and will continue on Saturday with Chelsea and the next Wednesday with the Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the composition.
Ector Bellerin and Aaron Ramzy did not come to Croatia, so they would probably play Mother Debushi and Arte.
Perhaps Wenger will also introduce Kiran Gibbs and Olivia Giru instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Wolcott.
"I'm trying to keep a balance and give a little pass to the players that need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is an unconditional favorite in Group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most striking in Europe.
Dinam has not lost any of the 41 fighters since they had their last season as "Invincible".
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was affected by an earthquake of 3.2 balls on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal has learned a lesson in the past season when the team suffered a defeat in the Monaco Championships League, and it remains with little hope to lead the club to victory at the Cuba Championships Final.
"It's an incredible drive," Wenger noticed.
Arsenal has never done that before.
We were very close to the target in 2006, but, on the other hand, I am a realist.
We have ambitions, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons from a man's friendship
The absence of such stories is being ignored, especially if it is taken into account how desperate the need for men to be honest is now more than ever, since the level of suicide among young men is up to 15 years old.
In 2013, this was the only major cause of men's death between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and it happens to men three times more often than women.
In an attempt to address the problem of the campaign against unhappiness, the year 2015 announced the Year of Men in order to address the challenges of culture, which does not allow men to seek help when they need it.
The company is at the center of this battle to accept this challenge.
A recent study of over 2,000 university students with symptoms of depression found that if the patient has enough friends “normally”, the chances of treatment are doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the number of physically healthy friends doubles the chance of a mental disorder.
Of course, though, friends need to work, above all, to be friends.
In a time when communication is managed by social networks, when the style of content is preferred, the speed of response is often appreciated more than content contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to be strong, loving, and successful, even if it is a reality of loneliness.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, total internal values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a greater impact on our mental health.
And as a billionaire recently noted, video game makers, you don't buy any more happiness for money.
The dignity of Friends is that they draw attention to this.
Each person was determined, not by his or her work, but by his or her personality.
Jumor Joey and Chandler's constant hugs, the moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, the breathing of Ross on Rachel - all comes from the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from a full study of their feelings.
As the Samaritan officer said to me, "...my role as a listener for people who feel depression and suicidal tendencies emphasizes how even the smallest communication of friends can benefit."
Often the men who approach us feel powerless to talk to their friends.
The old teaching "live with it" is as strong as the feeling that a frank discussion of problems can be perceived as weakness."
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I'm trying to offer longer-term mechanisms for overcoming.
It underscored the remarkable moments of a man’s friendship.
With regard to my task, the status of the telephone interviewer helps people at times of despair, while long-term support comes from a close family and friends.
So, if you visit FriendsFest at Comedy Central in these exits, where for the holiday, the decorations were completely restored, why not take your friends to Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see a single man in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
Never think of the benefits that friendship can bring.
Series Friends show on Comedy Central from the beginning and to the end, all 236 series, by tag #FriendsFest
De Maria kills a target by helping the PSG to burn the Malmo.
Angel di Maria will celebrate the battles of the Black Matthew and Edinson Cavani at the Malmo gate.
Angel Di Maria, who was a member of the Champions League, shot a goal, which allowed the PSG to easily go to Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's a match report and a game reaction.
Angel de Maria and Edinson Kawani did their job when Pari Saint-German started his game at the Champions League with a very comfortable victory 2:0 against Malmo at the Park de Prences Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria killed the ball less than four minutes after his first game at the League of Champions as a game of the "PSG" to direct the champions of France, but they missed out on a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when the Kawani killed the goal at 61 minutes.
Along with Real Madrid and the Dutch Shatter in Group A, Pari had to take a good start in the game against the Swedish champions, because they aimed not at qualifying the playoffs, but to continue a series of successful games of the last three seasons, where they came to four finals.
They earned their eyes, but at the same time it was not the best decision by Lauren Blan to consider the Golden Ibrahimic to be useless in the attack and later to replace him in the field against the command of his hometown and club, in which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win a home or a guest in the Champions League, so to win a 2:0, deliver trouble to the opponents and play a great defense, it's a good start, even if there are other moments we'll have to finish during the season," Blanc said.
That's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did, even though I'm sorry that we didn't kill one or two more bullets.
Ibrahimovic returned after the trauma in one of the replacements of the Paris team, which brought her nothing with 2:2 in the match with the "Bordo" in the First League in the exits, but he gave it back to De Maria's last plan for the fourth minute.
The Argentine attacker noted that he was a player who was able to bring the GSP to a new level in Europe, after being redeemed last month at Manchester United, and he proved why when he escaped from Mark Verratti behind the protection of Malmo and ended his attack beautifully by sending a ball outside of Johann Willand to the remote corner of the gate.
However, if someone had expected an easy and great victory at that time, they had to be disappointed.
Malmö, who won Seltik in the playoff to reach this stage, with nine world-level players in the field at the beginning of the game, five defenders and two strong semi-defensers in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But with the exception of the strike by Nikola Jurdzic, where the ball flew past the further stallion of Kevin Trappa's gate at 34 minutes, they attacked a little bit.
Therefore, in times of unrestrained transmissions and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimimovic, who was unable to make at least five attempts in the first half, and then failed to process the sword killed by Kawani immediately after the game was resumed.
However, he showed himself much more capable in the right passports, and it was a passport from Ibrahimic, which, Di Maria sent a ball with a round stroke, which had been pushed into the barn near Viland for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally killed after the time mark thanks to the Kawani, the Uruguayan killed his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimic had run the ball sent to the center of the left-hand field Maxwell.
This put an end to any idea that had been at Malmé's regarding the return to the game, and only the capture of the sword by Viland at a close distance did not allow David Louis to increase the final count before the goal of replacing Esekiel Lovessi was set aside at the end of the match.
Coach Malme Age Harede later admitted that the PSG was a class above his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last game at the League of Champions took place in December last year."
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, and that's not the level.
Not enough qualifications.
Farewell, Paris!
It was a great match with them.

White House confirms Si Xinpin's visit to Washington
The White House confirmed on Tuesday in an official report that the head of China Si Xinpin would come with an official visit to the United States at the end of this month.
This visit, the first visit of Si Zinpin to Washington, will take place on 25 September and will be a response visit to the arrival of President Barack Obama in Beijing last November, as stated in the statement.
The President and the First Lady of the United States, Michel Obama, will also welcome Si Xinpin and his wife, Pen Liuan, at the government dinner the same day after the two leaders hold bilateral negotiations.
"The visit of President Si Xinpin will provide an opportunity to enhance cooperation between the United States and China on common, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, as well as to enable the Presidents of the United States and China to deal constructively with controversial issues," the communication said.
It is expected that Si Xinpin, whose visit was first announced in February, will be held in Seattle to meet the leaders of several leading American technology companies on their way to Washington and then to go to New York to participate in the United Nations General Assembly in September.
Obama and Si Xinpin are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including the concern of Washington, which is related to the alleged cyber-spying by China and China ' s increased categoricality in the issue of the South China Sea dispute.
The hit biker in Kutuzovski was awarded a two-year colony.
In addition, the Court partially met civil claims against Dani Mirzoev for 1.2 million rubles.
The Dorogomilov Court of Moscow sentenced Danny Mirzoev to death by a motorcyclist at the Kutuzovske Prospect in Moscow.
As reported by the Russian News Service, Mirzoev received a two-year prison sentence in the settlement colony.
He was found to be guilty of the article "Infringement of road traffic rules and the operation of vehicles" of the RF.
In addition, the Court partially met civil claims of 1.2 million rubles.
During the debate, the prosecutor requested Mirzoeva to be sentenced to three years in prison and to obtain a total of eight million rubles for victims.
The accident, which is referred to, occurred on 22 May about three hours of night in the area of the house 30 on the Kutuzovske Prospect.
The BMW car, which was followed by Mirzoev, crossed the front lane and hit the motorcyclist on the side.
The birth of a man in 1989 ended on the ground.
Friends who died in social networks reported that the BMW driver had gone at high speed and had gone to the meeting area before the DTP.
Fearing that the driver was trying to get away from responsibility, the bikers organized a motorcycle test from the Vorboy Mountains to the building of HUMVD Moscow in Petrovka, 38.
Soon thereafter, it was known that the investigation had resulted in a delay in the alleged DTP offender.
In Moscow, a blind man was detained in the temple.
He took it easy and did not commit any wrong, and the police handed it over to his doctors for immediate psychiatric attention.
Police officers arrested the Moscow resident who entered one of the temples without clothing.
This is reported by the Moscow Agency.
As told by the head of the U.S. news service in Moscow, Andrey Galiakberov, an incident occurred on Tuesday, 15 September, about 4 p.m. at the Kasher Shosse.
A naked man entered the temple of Saint Nicholas.
He took it easy and did not commit any wrong.
There's been a call to the police.
Lawmakers were waiting for doctors from the immediate psychiatric care unit and handed them over to the man.
They were born to a 26-year-old resident of Moscow.
More than 40 orders and orders were signed by Vladimir Jakoushev.
More than 40 orders and orders were signed by the Governor of the Tumen Region, Vladimir Jakusev, at a meeting of the Bureau of the Regional Government.
Some of these included the provision of funds for educational and health institutions in municipal education.
In particular, funds are being made for the purchase of a bus for one of the schools in the Lowland Region, for the capital repair of the district hospital in the Kazan Region.
As indicated in accompanying documents, the money will be completed at the capital level of the second therapeutic office.
Warm and cold water supply, water supply, power grids and electrical equipment, ventilation systems will be refurbished, rooms will be refurbished, fire safety and energy conservation activities will be carried out.
There will be a second forum for the regions of Russia and Belarus in Sochi.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi on 17-18 September, where the Tumen delegation will take part in the leadership of the Governor.
The upcoming event in Sochi and the interim outcome of the cooperation is described by the honourable Consul General of the Republic of Belarus in Thumenia Vladimir Shugla, who is in the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorovic, what are the tasks of the Sochinium Forum?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Federal State.
It builds on the fruitful cooperation of the regions, an important link between the two States.
It is planned that the plenary meeting will be attended by the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin and the President of the Republic of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko.
The plenary and section meetings will discuss the experience of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policy, the legal provision and programmes of the Federal State.
The Forum will be attended by the Governor of the Tumen Region.
I think this is evidence of successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of the respective ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also attend the forum.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tumen region, will be operated.
I hope that the Forum will help to conclude new beneficial contracts and agreements.
I will add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk last June.
More than two hundred delegates, including 19 regions of Russia, participated in its work.
At that time, a very important treaty on cooperation between the Tumen and the Minas had been signed.
The importance of our work is also stated by the fact that there has been a permanent seminar in Thumenia at the Russian and Belarus Union Parliamentary Assembly.
In addition, the APC delegation of the Thumen region visited Belarus to study the experiences of Belarusians in training for agriculture, to identify additional convergence points and to organize new investment projects in the agro-industry complex.
You have recently met with the head of the region and head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During the meeting with the Governor of the Tumen Region, Vladimir Jakušev spoke about the cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus under the current unparalleled conditions.
The issue of the supply of Belarusian agricultural technology and the use of financial mechanisms is needed to reduce the cost of machinery for the final consumer.
Problems were discussed in the work of the Tumen Chamber of Commerce and options for preventing losses.
Matters are important, as investment projects must work clearly and bring income to the region.
This was the further supply of OAO freight equipment "MAZ", the development of the OAO service centre "MAZ", which was established in Tumena on the OAO-based "TTAP".
The discussion also focused on the preparation of a visit by the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus by the end of the current year.
Another topic was the conclusion of an agreement on trade, economic, scientific and cultural cooperation between the Tumen Region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of relations promise to reach a new level.
These issues were also addressed by the Regional Centre.
At a meeting with the head of the Tumeni City Administration, Alexander Moore, we talked about updating the Tumeni Bus Park.
About 100 buses are already "halved" and a new lot of cars from Belarus are required to operate on a gas, clean fuel.
Another aspect: The Tumen elevator factory cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of the OAO’s ‘Moglievliftmash’ elevator production, with a comprehensive approach.
In my view, these activities could become more active, taking into account new elevators in the area centre.
I would add that within the expanded powers of the Consul, there was a meeting with Governor of the Kurgan Region, Alexe Cocorina, during which the issue of increased trade and the provision of modern Belarusian technology in Zairela was discussed.
At the end of September, a meeting was scheduled with the Hungarian governor.
The expanded consular district includes five RF entities, but Tumenn can be called its own county headquarters.
The region is a hub for many promising projects, including the work of the honorary consul.
In general, such meetings are important and good for making it possible to deal directly and quickly with many problems by taking them away and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current circumstances, it is essential not to destroy the stock while continuing to work in the future.
Matt Damon against focusing on the ethnic diversity of people employed in film production
Matt Damon argued with the African-American producer Effi Brown, saying that there was no need to take into account the ethnicity.
During the resurrection of Project Greenlight on the HBO channel, a well-known actor interrupted Brown when she tried to highlight the need for alternative views on the main black heroin in the selected scenario.
"The diversity is appropriate when you're making a cast for the film itself, not for the show," Damon insisted.
The brilliant Brown, who didn't believe in his ears, was horrified at saying, "Oh, nothing." Well, it's all the time an actor from "Marsianin" made comments in the direct air.
To discuss the finalists of the show with Damon and Brown, Ben Afflek and Farelli colleagues joined.
"I would like the participants -- no matter who will be the director -- to think about what kind of treaty they're going to hold," Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black person is a prostitute who is being beaten by a white sceptre.
The film producer Dear White People was saying that the film director was Leo Angelos and Kristen Brankačo; Damon was strongly opposed to saying that "the result is that we can't get what we want."
After this discussion was shown on TV, social networks exploded with unfavourable comments to Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni was furiously quoted as saying in the video: "The explanation of the essence of the diversity of Matt Damon's only black man in the room TAKOE BELOE, which is painful."
tweeted more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's statements appear only once when the literacy of the racial theme in the media is the most pressing issue on the public debate agenda.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot by police in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained popularity throughout the country, urging legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the colouring population.
In February, the singer Prince mentioned this movement during the nomination of candidates for the album of the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like black books and lives, albums still matter.
Recently, Black Lives Matter movement leaders issued an official statement in response to the question of collaborator Fox News Elizabeth Hasselbeck whether this group would be considered as a group of haters.
"Seven Black Lives Matter is a group of love," said movement leaders.
It had recently been announced that Damon had been included in the list of actors in the show business, producers and media, invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
I don't know if the actor accepted the invitation and met with Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" awards the first champion
The professional rock and assistant officer Isaac Kaldjero became the first winner of the American Ninja Warrior show on Monday evening, taking away $1 million at home.
At this sports show, the 7th season just ended, none of the participants have yet been able to pass all stages of the road with obstacles.
At the end of the season, two participants -- Caldjero and operator Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task was to lift 75 feet in 30 seconds by rope.
Britton did his first assignment, and he spent the time, became the first athlete in the entire history of American Ninja Warrior, during the 4th dive stage, but Caldjero had a three-second challenge, which made him the winner.
After winning an incredible job, Caldjero, who was shocked at winning a million dollars, interviewed E!News.
"I've never earned or lived for more than $10,000 a year," Izek commented to reporters E! this serious leap of his income.
And secondly, I've never even imagined what it's like... the future doesn't know.
Executive Manufacturer Kent Weid met with The Hollywood Reporter reporters to talk about the finals and why Britten, who was the first to go on the track, won't get any money prize.
According to the rules, money is received by the fastest participant.
"If the finalising players are more than one, the prize gets the fastest of them," said Weid.
Although money is a wonderful reward and life changes, it still has great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels hurt about it.
He was happy what he did.
He's got tons of excited reactions from fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, "If I've been told to lose someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we changed our roles.
The show "America Ninja Warrior" will be back with the eighth season, which will begin in spring 2016.
"Dear Tigers" quietly surround "Minnesota Twins"
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season was not particularly fun for Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers is now taking the last place in the Central Division of the American League.
I'm just claiming to be a little confused, "Tigers" with a flash win on Tuesday at Minnesota Twins with a score of 5-4 at Targetfield.
"Twins" missed the chance to reduce the half-playing distance from Houston Astros and take second place in the playoff by the number of points after the winners.
For the Detroits, let's say for one night, it was a return to letter F, which had been most of them in the second half of the season.
"All the winnings are fun, no matter how they get," reported the "Tigers" manager Brad Osmus.
Pitcher "Tajers" Alfredo Simon made his contribution to supporting the attack, resulting in Detroit taking three points in the first two inches, then adding another one in the sixth and the other in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a painter in 6 1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
It was only his third quality start for nine exits.
"I just want to finish the year with good indicators," said Simon.
The replacement pies can't be thrown into each game, and that's why I want to go deeper into the game.
The "Tajers"-designated Victor Martines was able to undo three strokes and got two wounds -- the first RBI from mid-August.
It was the first day with three hits from four hits in the game against Seattle Mariners on 6 July.
"He worked well in battle," said Osmus.
He showed himself well in (batter quality), much better in the work of the beat and kept this quality for the game.
When he got three in the second half of the seventh inning, "Twins" got their best chance of getting back in the game.
The central host, Byron Baxton, opened the inning on the left-hand side of the field.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks, made a band, took the first base, and the second Bryan Dozer took a strike-out from Simon before taking his place left Blaine Hardy.
Hardy went to Morea, the only game on the way, before the newly appointed running Miguel Sano, who shot the two-run single on the left of Drew Verhagen.
In the case of a couple of wounded not in a car and a comparator wound on the second base of VerHagen, the third Beisman Trevor Pluff was able to lead to double-playing.
This was the 27th time for the leading league team in the season when Pluff shot the ball on the double.
After Detroit had added the insurance wound to the first half of the ninth inning, Morer earned RBI "double" in the space between the outfielders against the closing painter "Tigers" Bruce Rondon, and the account was 5-4.
However, the playwright beat Sano after three strikes and got his fifth saw.
Detroit took advantage of the temporary non-practicing Phil Hughes at the start of the game.
The Tigers earned three wounds in the first two innings against a deserving painter, who was on the list of traumatized before the game itself, without more than a month in the event of a fire.
"It's definitely not the start that I'd like," said Hughes, "but as the game developed, I felt more comfortable and so I was able to carry out a few pretty good frescoes in the third inning."
After the first beater reached the first base, he singled out the second bassman of Yen Kinsler.
The eye on two of J. D. Martinez's walrus cars was pulled out by Victor Martinez, who made a single in the middle for the first wound in the game.
Victor Martínez finished his "0 for 21" series with runners in a successful position.
The third base game, Nick Castelianos, followed by a single one, brought another wound, but Victor Martines was shot in an attempt to get closer to the third base, thereby eliminating the threat.
The Tigers have increased the account in the second inning by receiving a single double from James McCann's casserole and a two-car single from the central turning Anthony Gouz, and it's almost 3-0.
"It was a powerful hit," said the manager of "Twins" Paul Molitor.
He wasn't very good, but he went straight to the right point.
Hughes, whom he was considered to have fired a third-inch gun, was then replaced by the right-wing reliefer A.J. Ahter.
Heuzu was three in the morning for six hits and a four-stroke-out lesson.
NOTE: Anibal Sanches, right-wing Tigers, came out of the game due to the dispersal of his right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who had performed Sanchez on his shoulder in 2007.
For Sanchez, which is on the list of traumatized from mid-August, it is planned to start in the middle.
In the absence of Sanchez, the left-wing Daniel Norris will leave the list of traumatized people and go out against "Twins".
Norris, who left "Tajers" at four starters since his acquisition in exchange for David Price's left-hand drinker on 30 July, has 1 victory and 1 defeat.
He did not participate in games since 20 August due to muscle hair growth.
"Tigers" and "Twins" will finish a series of three games on Targetfield on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will play Ervin Santan's right-hand drinker (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original complaint by Cador on the book "Pray to God" was brought to the South-Sakhalin Court.
In the South-Sakhalin City Court, the original appeal was filed by the representative of Chechnya Ramzana Cadorova for the decision to accept the book "extremist material" "Pray for God: Its Meaning and Place in Islam", says Interfax, referring to the President of the Gorsud Aleksandr Chuhray.
The Court is now awaiting possible objections from the parties to the proceedings.
Chuchari refused to comment on the statements made by some of the MPs by the FP about the need to check the gap for possible cooperation with foreign special services and the IGIL.
"Shoot yourself to comment on such nonsense," he said.
On 11 September, the South-Sakhalin City Prosecutor's Office appealed to Judge Natalie Perchenko for recognition of the book "extremist material".
The prosecutor's office of South Sahalinska filed an appeal on Friday evening.
There are nuances: in the prosecutor's office they believe that they have asked the court to recognize only the extremist opinion of the author of this book, rather than the revelations of the Qur'an.
According to the prosecutor's office, the judge made the wrong decision," Chuhrai reported.
The decision to accept the book “Extremist Material” was taken on 12 August 2015.
In particular, the people of the Pharaoh were called, "We worship You and ask no one to help you with God."
Kadirov called the decision-makers on the book "Satans and Provocators".
He called on the Members of the House to prohibit, by law, judicial decisions relating to the texts of sacred writings.
"I firmly believe that the House should adopt a law prohibiting the judicial decision concerning the directly text of the Koran and other Divine Scriptures," Kadirov wrote in his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments that offend migrants and refugees
Facebook staff are planning to remove posts and comments that have been negatively assessed by migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints to the wrong content.
To combat the manifestations of xenophobia and racism in the network, Facebook has been jointly directed by the German Ministry of Justice.
Thus, the head of the department, Hayko Maas, recently stated that the monument is now working together with the network specialists to establish a special group of fashioners.
Its participants are required to track and remove irregularities in relation to migrants and refugees.
According to Hayko Maas, the authors of the non-tolerant posts are expected to receive notifications indicating the reason for their removal.
To facilitate the operational blocking of the wrongful content should also be provided by organizations whose experts collect complaints from users of complaints against abusive posts.
The Facebook manual is intended to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative statements to migrants and refugees, the social network management and the German Ministry of Justice was taken after a sharp increase in xenophobic attitudes in the German section of Facebook.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented migration crisis that had taken over the euro Union for a while.
Thus, in Germany today, all the items intended to accommodate refugees have already been filled.
The country ' s authorities had recently decided to temporarily settle migrants in the territory of the former Buchenwald Concluster.
Deprived displaced persons from the Middle East and Africa are housed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
There will be a relaxation zone in the Moscow shelters.
In the near future, a number of capital wells are equipped with specialized relaxation and psychological rest areas.
Among the first will be the Boutowski, the Domodeda, and the Sharbine Basin.
The first area for psychological rest has already appeared in the Trokoura Basin in Moscow.
Such areas will continue to occur in other areas of the city.
About this portal, m24.ru told Artem Ekimov, who is the head of the State Budgetary Institute Ritual.
The areas for relaxation will be small green areas, reminding parks.
In the opinion of the experts, such "angles" visitors will be able to rest, be united, and restore psychological forces.
In the near future, the relaxation zone will be built in the Domodedonian, Boutovski and Sharbini warehouses, and then in other areas of the capital.
According to the chapter of the GBU Ritual, where there is a need to expand the site, the builders will try to keep the existing forest masses as far as possible.
Green plantings will be a living trap that will divide the area of rest and areas directly below the burial site.
The experts of the GBU Ritual also stated their intention to propose a refusal of burial.
New warehouses can really be free.
In addition, the GBU Ritual reported that it was prepared to set up electronic terminals that would enable visitors to know the GPS coordinates and the number of burial marks.
In June of this year, Ritual was also proposed to adjust the value of the burial services, depending on the time of the year.
Yes, the mine will be on a thousand rubles in summer, a week of winter when the earth is frozen.
It should be noted that during the last year, the prices for all types of ritual services were on average 10 per cent.
Five days later, in the Greek forests, a stray climber was found.
The old man was alive, although he spent hundreds of hours in the forest without a commission.
The miner was able to be found through the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "The 79-year-old pensioner from the Tambov area spent five days in the forest."
No food and no water.
He was wanted by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even dogs movies, but there was no result.
The man was found after the search was connected to the helicopter.
On that day, Vitalius Alexandrovich usually went to the woods behind his shoes and pillows, but he did not return to dinner.
The family immediately sought help, and on the next day, about 30 people were rescued from the nearby village by rescue and inequity.
On the fifth day, the helicopter of the fire-saving centre joined them.
Andrei Seletkov, head of the search and rescue team of the Fire and Rescue Centre of the Small Area, said: "The helicopter was attracted, the man was found."
He's gone very far, quite elsewhere.
It was about 12 km from the search site.
He's gone through a lot of distance at his age.
It's a miracle to stay alive.
The cemetery was delivered to the Greek central district hospital without any knowledge, in a very difficult condition.
The doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and overheating of the body.
As an elderly man was able to stay alive after five days in the forest, doctors are not at all present.
Valentina Nepša, who is the head of the Greek Therapeutic Office: "A patient survey, treatment is scheduled."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Taking into account all his chronic diseases.
The patient's condition improved in the morning, it remains difficult, but with positive dynamics.
Pensioner Vitaly Alexanderovich comes to Smolenčina from the Tambov area every year.
His grandson says that his grandfather was going to collect mushrooms before, but he never got deeper in the woods.
Alexei Spitchenko, the grandson of the found mushroom, said, "You're not far from the road, you're not, in principle, local."
He's been visiting his family for a few years.
Well, he went after the mushrooms.
I see he's gone a long way and he's gone.
At the beginning of the flu season, people are regularly lost in all areas of the Small Area.
Just in the last few days, five similar cases.
Rescuers remember: In the woods you have to walk in bright clothes, with little food storage, spasms and compass.
Furthermore, it is desirable to leave behind traces so that they can be returned.
The An-2 emergency settlement on average in the brotherly tiga.
On average, the village in Siberia is the Anna-2 accident.
An extra landing from the Red Air Force Enisey took place 68 kilometers from Bratska.
There are no dead and injured, but the plane itself has suffered significant damage when landed.
An-2 was on a business trip.
There were three crew members on board -- the commander, the second pilot and the ship mechanic, says "Interfax".
The crash aircraft was flying over the Railway-Ilimsk-Achinsk route, which is based on the airline.
The aircraft crew has already been delivered to Bratsk.
The Bratial Transport Prosecutor ' s Office, following an emergency landing, began verification of compliance with flight safety legislation.
The investigation team of the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor ' s Office was on the scene.
In September 2010, Tu-154 crew deployed their aircraft with passengers due to technical failure at the abandoned cargo airport in the Komi.
Engines and ship electronics were rejected by the liner, but the crew made it impossible.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board.
No one was hurt when the plane landed.
News Economics - Nobel laureate: globalization
The printing of globalization processes should have helped to reduce global inequality.
In fact, the situation seems to be different, but the income gap in developing economies is growing.
Eric Maskin.
In order to correct this, it is necessary to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers, according to the Chief Scientific Officer of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Decisions of the U.S.E., the Nobel Prize Prize for Economics, Eric Maskin, 2007.
Over the past 20 years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.
Globalization partners predicted great benefits for developing economies.
"And these predictions have come true in many ways," says Maskin.
For example, China and India have had a significant increase in GDP per capita.
But it's not that happy.
Globalization was expected to reduce the gap between “poor” and “poor” in poor countries, which is largely inequality of income, and more precisely the wages of work.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article "Why global markets have not reduced inequality in developing economies," published in The World Bank Economic Review, which the U.S.A. has translated and quoted.
Together with the economist, Professor Michael Kremer of Harvard University, Eric Maskin has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why the income gap in poor countries is increasing as globalization grows, the U.S.N.E.
Specific processes are under way in the new global market.
To demonstrate them, Maskin allocates four levels of professional qualifications - A and B for rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, the level of qualifications of poor D professionals is insufficient to cooperate with A and B professionals from rich countries.
And if employees at level C from poor countries grow due to the cooperation of staff B from rich people, D workers do not feel growth or their wages fall altogether.
The result is that internationalization of production will contribute to an increase in the pay gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and thus to an increase in inequality.
The Kremer and E. Maskini proposed an amazingly beautiful model, alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantages.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fuad Alekskerov, a leading professor at the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Decisions, Head of the Department of Mathematics of the U.S.U.S. Department of Mathematics.
And as any powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to empirical work in this area.
The problem is, in the opinion of Eric Maskin, to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the workers themselves, as the scholar notes, do not have the means to pay for their training.
In this situation, Governments, international agencies, NGOs and private funds can play a significant role, says Maskin.
The scholar notes that the theory developed does not in any case call for a halt to the globalization process, which brings and brings fruit in the form of GDP growth in countries.
Derbent: A live connection of time.
Derbent, one of Russia's oldest cities, notes his 2000s in September.
In the holiday programme, the National Culture Festival of the peoples of Dagestan and the past-style fair, the exhibition of derbents and the Day of Open Temples, the historic and musical show "2000s in two hours" and excursions to the reconstructed Peter I Museum.
Middle Ages of the Narin-Kala fortress, ancient Arabic inscriptions on walls, narrow alleys and garden gardens, all of which came from the "Third Nights and One Night" page.
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has remained in place since ancient times.
Although it was claimed by the Roman Empire, by Byzantines, Hazar Kaganat, and by the Golden Order.
The age of the eastern platinum, which grows in the derbent Juma Mosque, is equal to several centuries.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the "Drevijas - Memories of Living Nature" of the Universe.
The shade of scattered cranes saves palatials and tourists during the summer fire.
The guests of the mosque will pour their aromatized tea and enjoy the dagestian flavors, such as honey angrier, luma, musculoskeletal, beauty, iron and sweetness.
In Derbente, the rest of the centuries is used by large suicides to drink a cup of plenty of guests.
The inscription on the entrance to the Juma Mosque says that the building was built in 115 hijra.
That's 733 on the Gregorian calendar.
It's the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is filled with vibrating and festiveness: the arcades of domes and jars are based on square columns and are illuminated by the windows of the sun.
The content and distribution of blues is the traditional involvement of the Derbents.
The owners of domestic birds put pigeons in the courtyards, under the trees, on the meadows.
It's an exciting sight. It's flying into the sky in a room of white pigeons, similar to the flames of a holiday fire.
In order to defend the enemy, the ancient Persians crossed the Caspian gates of a double stone wall.
Going 500 metres into the sea, this facility stopped the Derbent gate.
In 2003, the Derbenta fortress walls were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best preserved memory of ancient Persian fortification.
The roofs in Derbente were still in the fifth century, and the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged until our day.
In one of the urban markets, the streets are sold on any taste - the palaces of the shear, the boy or the soldier of all colors and shades, with the hair and without it, with a complex ornament and a wonderful fireplace.
The construction of the city began with a magal - neighborhood with a single stone structure.
Over the years, the jaws have barely changed.
Only satellite plates, wall conditioners and street lights remind you that you are not in the middle of the century, but in the modern city.
In the old part of the city, details of the watercourse built by the Persians were preserved about a thousand years ago.
To this day, ancient sources of water are being used by locals.
Many derbenzes prefer ordinary water from tap water from verified historical fountains.
In Derbente, there was one of the focal points.
Coniferous and scissors, candles, candles, cups were appreciated throughout the Caucasus.
The hands of the gongs are now making remarkable ceramic products, both practical and sovereign.
On holidays and festivals, crowds of spectators gather under the canal, where the students of the Republican School of circus art are represented.
The history of amazing and risky crafts has existed for centuries.
The new trend among Canadians is that girls are becoming more and more visible.
The Museum of Culture and the Art of Ancient Derbent works in the premises of the former Virgin Banni.
In the past, unmarried girls and bridesmaids have been washed away in the company of friends, and now anyone who wants to see the pool, hot and cold pools that have gone into the past for the bath.
In most Derbent houses there are hot water, but baths and couples are popular in our days as in the past.
For the benefit of heating the body by steam, ancient books have been written.
After the bath, the blood improves, the muscles lose weight, the body acquires flexibility and ease.
The Society Festival, which is held in the territory of Narin-Kala fortress, is attended by the ethnic courts of many areas of Dagestan.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk songs, perform songs from the peoples of the Caucasus and enjoy visitors with a delicious home cheese.
Kirghlar is a burial place for four martyrs who have their heads behind Islam.
It's one of the most respected complexes for a Muslim in the North Caucasus.
The desirable sarcophagus has been cut off from the entire stone blocks and is guided, as the Arabs have said, by the west-east axis.
The brothers Gabriel and Albert Jacobs strangle and brew customers in a small salon near the Upper Base.
Parish has been in this place for many years.
Circumstances are passed from generation to generation.
In this way, the brothers of Jacob can make not only a traditional but most modern beehive.
On one of the streets of the Old Town, there was a house in which the writer-decabrit writer Alexander Bestužev-Marlinski lived.
Learning Turkish and collecting ethnographic material, he described Derbent in the first third century C.E. with his ancient monuments, life, and food.
Chichana is a traditional Eastern club where only tea and household heating are provided.
Men come here to ease their thirst, communicate with their friends, and solve some work problems.
As in the past, it is not recommended for women to cross the threshold of tea.
The Caspian Derbent dance ensemble was established three years ago, but has already been able to participate in the activities of the Republican and Russian levels.
The ensemble soloists repeat every day, exploring folk avalanches, dagines, tats, Armenian dances.
As the evening comes, when the noise and the street bells are lit, the locals are lying on the benches near the houses with the speaker’s terrazes.
Debents usually discuss domestic issues.
But in front of the anniversary, they remember more and more the episodes of the unique history of their city, which affected the fate of the entire region of Montenegro and the Caspian region.
There was a business "game at the airport" in Domodeda.
The capital has a new form of education.
Four hundred students have tried as airport staff.
For this, three aircraft models have been installed in Domodeda.
Young people not only watched and registered passengers but also served airplanes.
All of this is in the form of a business game, but it has not come true at all.
The late voyages, immediately two passengers with a break on board, the trap was lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
For this airport - ad.
A standard set of tasks to be decided on by the newcomers was based in the Angara Domodedova.
Three major airports from different countries of the world were immediately accommodated in one Angara.
Today, four hundred students from city colleges and colleges work.
An unprecedented opportunity to learn all about the interior of the aircraft.
Passenger registration, aircraft service, baggage traffic, even buses on the flight, stairs, and passenger inspection were entrusted.
And the passengers are very troublesome.
In one mess with the documents, the other was late on the trip, the third filled the bag with suspicious items.
And we need to deal with all of this, as in life, at a minimum.
For each of these tasks, they shall be charged a certain amount of virtual cash, as if the airline had paid them the corresponding amount for the service of travel.
“There is a fine for non-implementation of their respective tasks”, explains the financial analyst for the Dmitry Hilko in an interview with the news programme.
The officials of the Ministry of Education are closely monitored.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try a new form of education.
It has already been held in the course of secondary vocational education.
"There will be six interregional centres of competence, which will in fact become new models of modern colleges with modern management, with highly qualified staff, with modern equipment," explains the director of the Department of Public Policy in the field of training of staff and additional vocational education of the Ministry of Education of Russia Natalie Zolotareva.
That's why students don't have global plans.
After three days of such training, they seem to need an exit.
Therefore, the evaluations for the examination had a very substantive expression.
Newest smart eyes, the best I've ever seen!
"I received them for responding to our airport claim in Instagram in time," is a happy player, pier manager of the Frankfurt Airport team, Sergei Schwałov.
The best judges, which is called, have taken a stand to invite them to work at the end of the course.
The US Embassy regrets the closure of the US Centre in Moscow.
The US Embassy in Russia regretted the closure of the foreign literature library of the American Centre.
The Centre has been working in Moscow for over 22 years.
The US Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian Government to close the US Embassy Centre at the M.I.Rudomino State Library in Moscow.
"The unilateral steps recently taken by the RF are questioning the commitment of the Government of Russia to relations between the Russian and American peoples that have not been interrupted even during the cold war and at other difficult times of the long history of our country's relations," says the US Ambassador John Teffta, quoted in the Interfax.
The U.S. Centre has established deep and strong ties between people and Russian and United States cultures.
He was the center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and served as a venue for meetings with many American prominent actors, including cosmonauts, artists, sportsmen, scientists, politicians and writers.
"Only last year the American Centre conducted more than 400 cultural and educational activities and adopted more than 50,000 Russian visitors," the diplomat stressed.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project, the FLEX Education Exchange Programme (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Tribunal was quick to settle.
Typical situation: Four officers are standing at the table of Judge Svatter Kumar, hearing his claim for the work done.
The court is not entirely satisfied with the quality of your work.
We have not given you a warrant of 110 degrees, that you may be comforted in it,' said Kumar.
If there's one more tow, we'll show you all the buildings available.
Kumar is headed by the National Green Tribunal (NPT) - a judicial authority established in 2010 to stop the rapid pollution of the environment, resulting in a sharp economic growth in recent decades.
At that time, the Tribunal was able to consider more than 10,000 air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and dam construction claims.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to terminate the construction leading to pollution.
The rates are incredibly high: for the under 60 years since India had declared its independence to be a strong industrial development, it had become the country of virgin jungles in one of the most populated and contaminated countries in the world.
The problem is particularly acute in large megapolises, where the development of infrastructure does not speed up the rush of urbanization: the city is covered with a fleet, the rivers are filled with pesticides and wastes of businesses and households, and a few remaining living masses are cut off by new living quarters.
Despite the formal support of the State for the green movement, NZT is regularly criticised by the Government of Narendra Modi, as major investment projects are often the main cause.
Yes, in May this year, the Minister of the Environment called the judgments of the court “extreme” and “implementable”.
Sometimes the court's decision is indeed impossible to fulfil within the time limit set by the court, confirms the environmental counsel of Raj Panjvani.
However, there is also a positive side for non-compliance: at least they force responsible persons to move.
"His main goal is to break this system," adds the lawyer.
The Green Tribunal has already abolished large structures several times: to end the construction of the airport, electricity stations and hundreds of smaller facilities.
However, people are also trying to remember: for example, during the discussion of the fate of the pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagnan, which polluted the local river by the factor.
We can close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People are losing their jobs," Kumar commented.
However, such explanations are not always understood by ordinary people whose lives can be changed by a single set of judges.
In April, the Tribunal decided to prohibit all vehicles from entering the capital for more than 10 years, rather than causing public remorse.
Despite the dramatic decline in popularity and criticism, Svatanter Kumar refused to withdraw the decision.
Instead, he ordered from the Government of the Department statistics on the entry and departure of vehicles, as well as an offer to purchase 10,000 additional buses, previously learned at the factories whether they were in a position to execute such an order.
As the Court began to focus on pollution sources such as landfills, fuel quality and even road accidents, people’s anger began to slow down.
But the most painful topic of the principle judge was the Gang River Cleanup Program, with a pump announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to Ganga, a Hindu - god, the judge often ceases to hold his emotions and turns to cry.
You know what the word "holy" means?
Someone threw water out of Ganga for the statue of God, and there were feces in it, and the judge was burning.
You continue to pollute the river because you think that Gang is Gang, he will take away all our sins.
This is the river we worship, and see what you do with it every day.
The cleanup of Ganga is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project announced by the new Government.
The number of fecal bacteria in this river is now more than 120 times the norm.
Each year between 1.5 and 3 out of 700 million Indians are dying from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even made a donation to the Gang Rescue Fund for money from the sale of his costume, where he met Barack Obama and another 455 items from his personal collection.
Ecologists here accused the prime minister of populism: the suit was bought for $700 thousand, while the river cleaning required at least eight billion.
The Green Tribunal ' s partners agree that India will have to go a long way before it can call itself a developed country, but do not believe that the price of progress should be an ecological one.
“In the developing country, discussions on the environment are often seen as an involuntary development,” said the Activist Malik Bhanot.
And the court is trying to find a gold medium between ecology and development."
The man poured blood on several pictures of Dali at the exhibition in Riga.
A visitor to the Latvian Union of Artists' Exhibition in Riga broke windows in the museum and exported the sculpture of Salvador Dali, "An angel's Revelation".
The museum is now presenting the work of El Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso.
The man of 1985 entered the sculpture hall at 14:20.
He immediately said that he was inadequate: he exported the sculpture, broke the windows.
He then moved on to the premises and covered several works of the permanent exhibition with blood.
Among them is the portrait of the Message of the Mervaldis Police.
According to the President of the Latvian Union of Artists Igoria Obbučina, which is referred to as “Interfax”, there were also outbreaks.
Police and artistic experts are working at the scene.
The latter determine the size of the damage and damage.
A criminal case of hypocrisy has been brought against men.
In the Latvian Union, from 4 August to 27 September, the works of Picasso and Dali are presented with more than 200 original works of artists.

Si Xinpin calls for a more open economy for peace
The economy should be more open to the world to boost its growth, as President Si Xinpin said on Tuesday in addressing the reform leadership task.
“China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and developing a policy of openness,” he said, addressing the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group on Full Integration of Reform.
He said that the expansion of openness and the deepening of reforms would give the economy new impetus and life force and provide new space for economic development.
The Steering Group adopted a number of directives, including the regulation of market access for investors, the amendment of border controls, the promotion of public enterprises (SOEs) involving private capital and the revision of the population registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be phased out through pilot programmes.
This is an important step, as it will give the market a more significant role in the allocation of resources, the rule of law in business and the increase in openness, as stated in the statement.
The Government will also weaken control over the powers given to its companies by guaranteeing that companies themselves will carry out their business.
The statement also states that China will allow border regions to adopt new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for strengthening local growth.
More areas will be available to private investors to increase the openness of the sub-control State of the economic sectors.
"The Government will not change its policy on foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign financing companies and provide them with better conditions," said the statement.
The application procedure for a permanent residence permit for foreigners, or a green card, will be further facilitated by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the delivery process itself.
The meeting also discussed the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report issued after the meeting, it was also attended by Prime Minister Li Katán and by the ministers Liu Yunshan and Zhan Gaoli.
